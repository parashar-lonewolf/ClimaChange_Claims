        <p>STEM cells, which live deep in the bone's marrow, are the grandmother cells of the body, giving rise to all manner of progeny cells that regenerate blood and bone and tissue. As such, they hold great medical promise in treating cancer patients and as a fundamental ingredient in new gene therapies.</p>
        <p>But stem cells are elusive. Only one in 2 million to 10 million bone marrow cells is a stem cell. Researchers have developed different techniques to obtain the stem cells from the marrow. But even so, they are faced with a finite supply.</p>
        <p>Scientists have sought ways to induce stem cells, by exposing them to growth factors or other agents, to divide and reproduce. But although the stem cells divide into new cells, the new cells differentiate into more mature cells rather than stem cells, and thereby lose their most important properties.</p>
        <p>Dr. Stephen G. Emerson, a professor of medicine who is the chief of hematology and oncology at the University of Pennsylvania, took a different approach: Instead of adding substances to stem cells, he made a laboratory approximation of the environment in which stem cells live in the human body. In doing so, he got the stem cells to replicate themselves at approximately the same rate they would in the body.</p>
        <p>Dr. Emerson expects to receive tomorrow what appears to be a fundamental patent for his technique. The patent has been assigned to Aastrom Biosciences, a biotechnology company in Ann Arbor, Mich.</p>
        <p>In Dr. Emerson's technique, the stem cells are mixed with nutrients and other substances in a round, flat cassette that he described as being the size of a large pizza. Then the cassette is inserted into a ''bio-reactor,'' where a gaseous mixture of oxygen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide sits above a membrane. The oxygen diffuses across the membrane to the cells in the cassette below.</p>
        <p>''It recreates the rate of flow of plasma and nutrients to cells and recreates the proper oxygenation of the cells,'' Dr. Emerson said.</p>
        <p>The ability to propagate stem cells could have immediate benefits for cancer patients whose blood counts fall after getting high doses of chemotherapy or radiation. In May, Dr. Patrick Stiff, director of the bone marrow transplant program at Loyola University Medical Center, reported on successful clinical trials with breast cancer patients who had received stem cells grown in an Aastrom bioreactor.</p>
        <p>According to Aastrom, its new technique is cheaper but also far less traumatic to the patient, from whom it requires the extraction of relatively fewer stem cells. Patients also can receive a larger number of stem cells than they would otherwise get.</p>
        <p>''Other techniques require the patient to be in the doctor's office up to 40 hours and can be very invasive, with the patient getting from 25 to 150 needle sticks,'' Douglas Armstrong, president of Aastrom, said. ''Our approach under development takes less than an hour and requires only 4 to 10 needle sticks.''</p>
        <p>Aastrom has other trials under way at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, the South Texas Cancer Institute and the Duke University Medical Center.</p>
        <p>But another important application of growing stem cells is in gene therapy. Unlike most other kinds of cells, which live only for a few days or weeks, stem cells continue to produce new cells over a lifetime.</p>
        <p>That means that stem cells genetically altered to correct for hemophilia or sickle cell anemia, for example, could be injected into a patient's blood, where they would migrate to the bone marrow and then would manufacture new, ''corrected'' blood cells in perpetuity.</p>
        <p>Genetic information is locked up in a cell's nucleus, which forms a dense tight ball that is difficult to penetrate. Only when the cell is in the process of dividing does the nucleus become vulnerable to the insertion of a new gene.</p>
        <p>''Many investigators have tried different ways to penetrate the nucleus,'' Dr. Emerson said. ''But only by getting stem cells to divide has anyone had any success.''</p>
        <p>Aastrom said it anticipated that the new patent, as well as others in the pipeline and already issued to Dr. Emerson, will make it necessary for companies in the gene therapy field to license the technology.</p>
        <p>''A lot of people are using this approach to different degrees,'' Dr. Armstrong said.</p>
        <p>Will the patents raise the ire of the scientific community, as did one granted several years ago to Systemix Inc., now a unit of Novartis A.G. of Switzerland, which covered a way to purify stem cells?</p>
        <p>''I think the industry will be surprised at the patent,'' Jean-Paul Lavalleye, Aastrom's patent lawyer, said. ''A lot of people were gunning for this result. The difference is that the Aastrom technology is the enabling technology. To use an analogy: We invented the car; everyone else is coming up with turbochargers or some other accessory to the original invention.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Emerson, Michael Clarke, a professor of medicine at the University of Michigan, and Bernhard Palsson, a professor of bioengeneering at the University of California at San Diego, are scheduled to receive patent 5,646,043, which will be held by the University of Michigan but which has been exclusively licensed to Aastrom.</p>
        <p>Dark Horse Takes Creativity Honors</p>
        <p>What is the most innovative state in the union? California residents filed the most patent applications in 1996: 23,082. New York, in second place, had 8,733 applications.</p>
        <p>But adjusted for population, the runaway winner is . . . Idaho.</p>
        <p>According to a ranking created by the Intellectual Property Owners Association, Idaho filed nearly 108 patent applications per 100,000 residents. Minnesota comes in a distant second with nearly 78 applications per 100,000, and Massachusetts is third with about 77.</p>
        <p>Which states filed the fewest applications, adjusted for population? Alabama is 48th, with about 13 applications per 100,000; Mississippi is 49th, with 10.5, and Arkansas is last, with about 10.</p>
        <p>Patents are available by number for $3 from the Patent and Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.</p>
