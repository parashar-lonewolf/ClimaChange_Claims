        <p>Over the last 40,000 years, as anatomically modern but primitive hunters spread around the world, species after species of big animals vanished from the earth in their wake. ''Blitzkrieg'' has long been scientists' favorite image for these spasms of biological destruction.</p>
        <p>Nowhere, perhaps, was the extinction more striking than in New Zealand, where an entire class of large flightless birds called moas, 11 species and an estimated 160,000 individuals in all, once lived. New evidence now suggests that it may have been the most rapid extinction ever brought about by primitive people.</p>
        <p>Some moas were about as big as turkeys, but others were awesome ostrichlike creatures, the largest weighing more than 500 pounds and standing 10 feet tall. Skeletons show that they were built remarkably like some dinosaurs. They had never encountered anything like the stone-age Polynesians who colonized their islands in the late 13th century, and the big birds presumably had no fear of them; a hunter probably could have just walked up and killed one at will.</p>
        <p>So by the time the ship of British explorer James Cook first brought Europeans to New Zealand in 1769, every last one was gone. The conventional view has been that the Polynesians, ancestors of today's Maori people, hunted and otherwise drove the moas to extinction in a thousand years or so.</p>
        <p>But now scientists say evidence from the early Polynesian settlements, plus new calculations based largely on the birds' reproduction profile, indicate that on the scale of geological time, the extinction was lightninglike, requiring 160 years at most and, probably, considerably less. The scientists say the destruction of the moas, by club and snare, was the fastest extinction of big animals -- what scientists call megafauna -- so far.</p>
        <p>It was apparently even more rapid than the swift rate at which some scientists believe large creatures like mammoths, mastodons, camels, ground sloths and giant beavers were exterminated by prehistoric hunters in a North American blitzkrieg about 13,000 years ago. The cause of those extinctions has been hotly debated and remains unsettled.</p>
        <p>The extermination of the moas ''is probably the clearest instance of the extinction of a whole fauna of large animals'' in a short time by hunter-gatherers, said Dr. Richard N. Holdaway, the chief author of the new study, which appears in the current issue of the journal Science.</p>
        <p>A paleobiologist specializing in the biology of extinctions, Dr. Holdaway runs a private research company called Palaeocol Research in Christchurch, New Zealand. His co-researcher was Chris Jacomb, curator of archaeology at the Canterbury Museum in Christchurch.</p>
        <p>With some exceptions, experts say, large-scale extinction of big animals generally coincided with the arrival of early modern humans in places where they had never been. This did not happen in Africa, they theorize, because people and other animals evolved there together, and African animals were therefore not so naive about humans.</p>
        <p>One of the most rapid extinctions was in North America, where not just big plant-eaters but also the predators that depended on them -- including saber-toothed cats, short-faced bears, cheetahs, maned lions and bigger versions of today's wolves -- are believed to have vanished in perhaps 400 years.</p>
        <p>Three possible causes have been advanced for this extinction episode. Two are related to the blitzkrieg hypothesis: that humans swept across the continent from Siberia in a ''killing front'' that moved perhaps 100 miles in a decade, and that the animals were killed by diseases carried by people and their dogs from Siberia. The third hypothesis says that rapid climate change played the critical role.</p>
        <p>For New Zealand, Madagascar and many Pacific islands, few would deny that the first arriving humans caused mass extinction, said Dr. Jared Diamond, an ecologist at the University of California at Los Angeles, who wrote a commentary on the new study in Science. The only questions, he said, are how fast the extinctions were and whether hunting was the only cause. For New Zealand, he said, the new study ''shows that moa extinctions were very fast and were mainly by hunting.''</p>
        <p>Several lines of evidence have led to this conclusion. First, based on revised radiocarbon dating of charcoal and other materials in campsites of the Maori ancestors, the earliest arrival of Polynesians in New Zealand has now been placed in the 13th century rather than 1,000 years ago, as previously thought.</p>
        <p>Second, archaeological analysis of the dismembered remains of moas in the campsites indicate that none were killed after the 14th century.</p>
        <p>Now Dr. Holdaway and Mr. Jacomb have calculated the likely rate at which the moas disappeared. The moas' reproductive profile was a key to the analysis: They were long-lived and slow to mature and breed. They laid only one or two eggs at a time and raised perhaps one chick a year.  If they were killed at even a low rate, they would not be able to reproduce fast enough to keep up.</p>
        <p>In their calculations, Dr. Holdaway and Mr. Jacomb assumed conservatively that the first Polynesian colonists numbered only 100 people, that their population grew at only 1 percent a year, that they did not eat moa eggs or destroy moa habitat and that they killed only one female per week per 20 people. Even so, the time to extinction was no more than 160 years. Less conservative assumptions -- and more likely ones, in Dr. Diamond's view -- yielded even shorter times to extinction.</p>
        <p>There is ''no way of interpreting this record other than that it had to happen virtually overnight,'' said Dr. Ross MacPhee, a mammalogist at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, who has extensively studied ancient extinctions. Further, he said, the evidence makes a ''really very impressive'' case for hunting as the prime cause. If that is true, he said, ''this is easily the best instance of overkill, of blitzkrieg, on the record.''</p>
        <p>But Dr. MacPhee has long found it hard to believe that in general, a few hunters with primitive weapons could wipe out entire species, and he is the leading proponent of the idea that disease was mainly responsible.</p>
        <p>He expressed skepticism that New Zealand's early hunters could have tracked down every member of every moa species, especially the smaller ones and those that might have lived in hard-to-get-at places in the islands' rugged mountains.</p>
        <p>Also, he suggested, it would have been harder and more time-consuming to find moas as their numbers diminished; and as the more favored bigger birds disappeared, the hunters would have abandoned the chase as not worth the effort. ''At the end of the moas' tenure in New Zealand, people would have been doing virtually nothing else'' than hunting them, he said. It is more likely, he said, that the people turned to other food sources, like seals and seafood, before all the moas were gone.</p>
        <p>The point is illustrated by a smaller, well-known survivor of the New Zealand blitzkrieg, a small flightless bird that has a low reproduction rate but is hard to find: the kiwi.</p>
        <p>But the fact is, Dr. Holdaway and Dr. Jacomb wrote, ''even minimal levels of human hunting pressure caused an irreversible decline in the moa population.'' The results of their study, Dr. Holdaway said, ''reinforce the view that people with even the most basic technologies -- fire, clubs, snares -- can have major environmental effects.''</p>
        <p>The moas are in any case long gone. ''Yes, this was a blitzkrieg,'' Dr. Diamond wrote in Science. ''Yes, a few people could and did kill every moa.''</p>
