        <p>WHO knows what evil lurks in the heart of a foreign mid-cap value stock?</p>
        <p>While others scramble to divine the stock market impact of, say, a  nuclear test on the Indian subcontinent, the folks who run the Calvert World Values International Equity fund can spend time on broader issues, like whether nuclear testing is  right or wrong.</p>
        <p>You may recognize the fund's parent, Calvert Group of Bethesda, Md., known for its ''socially responsible'' domestic funds, which shun companies that deal in tobacco, alcohol or weaponry. Calvert World Values, however, is the only socially responsible fund tracked by Morningstar that invests solely in foreign stocks. (Citizens Global Equity, a global fund, invests in the United States as well as abroad.)</p>
        <p>The first thing investors should know is that the ethical compass used by Calvert World Values differs from that of its domestic siblings -- a difference that the company readily acknowledges. ''We have our view of corporate social responsibility but at the end of the day, we're running a competitive investment portfolio,'' said Jon H. Lickerman, director of social investment research for Calvert. ''We're certainly not purists.''</p>
        <p>For example, Calvert expects its American companies to derive virtually none of their revenues from tobacco or alcohol. But Calvert World Values can invest in companies that derive as much as 10 percent of their revenues from tobacco or alcohol.</p>
        <p>The fund cannot buy shares of companies that earn more than 10  percent of their revenue from weapons contracting, which is the same restriction its parent applies in the United States. But in America, Calvert adds extra screens, for example, knocking off companies that net the top 85 percent of the Defense Department's weapons contracts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lickerman attributes the varying standards to ''cultural and social differences.'' He added that ''markets abroad tend to be more concentrated, and we focus on blue-chip companies.'' Many foreign companies are conglomerates with, say, a distiller or aerospace company as part of the mix.</p>
        <p>There are some absolutes. The fund will not buy shares in companies that use child labor or forced labor. And because their countries are on Calvert's short list of human-rights abusers, the fund would be hard-pressed to own shares in companies based in Myanmar, China or Nigeria; it can own the stock of companies that do business in those countries.</p>
        <p>But American concepts like workplace equality and the rights of workers to organize are ''aspirational,'' Mr. Lickerman said. ''We don't really expect Japanese companies to have equal employment opportunities for women, but we seek to find them.''</p>
        <p>How does the fund work? The portfolio is managed by Andrew V. Preston, director of Murray Johnstone International, based in Glasgow. Mr. Preston starts with a top-down approach, searching for markets that are relatively undervalued. Then, he and seven Murray Johnstone analysts search for stocks with good earnings-growth potential and reasonable valuations.</p>
        <p>After Mr. Preston has selected a list of likely stocks, he goes through Calvert's social criteria and tosses out those that don't make the grade. (Calvert won't state the ratio.)</p>
        <p>When the fund decided that Germany was looking attractive, it zeroed in on Daimler-Benz. That automaker did not fit its social criteria -- Calvert won't say why -- so the fund bought Volkswagen instead. ''Yes,  it's frustrating, but it's also challenging to find companies that fit both criteria,'' Mr. Preston said.</p>
        <p>Since its inception in July 1992, Calvert World has returned 10.8 percent, annualized, compared with 11.5 percent for the average foreign stock fund, according to Morningstar Inc., the financial publisher in Chicago. But through May 29, its three-year average annualized total return was 14 percent, versus 12.5 percent for its average peer fund. For the 12-month period, it returned 15.2 percent, versus 13.8 percent for its average peer.</p>
        <p>As for the fund's biggest current holdings, there are a lot of staid financial firms: Zurich Insurance of Switzerland, Banque National de Paris and Fortis, a Belgian insurance company.</p>
        <p>Currently, Mr. Preston's favorite market is Britain, at 19 percent of the fund; followed by France, 14 percent, and Japan, 11 percent. Just 10 percent of the fund is in emerging markets. And it does not yet have a policy to address investments in India or Pakistan after their nuclear tests. It has no holdings in either country.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lickerman has become something of an activist. ''We visit with senior management, address our social and environmental concerns and nudge them forward,'' he said. One example is First Group, a British bus company that he helped push into using more compressed natural gas to minimize greenhouse gases.</p>
