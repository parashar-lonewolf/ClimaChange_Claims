        <p>Editorial says Gov George W Bush's confident performance at second presidential debate rested in part on skillful way he portrayed differences between himself and Vice Pres Al Gore; says Gore let pass several opportunities to rebut Bush's characterizations; says there are stark differences between two; holds that Gore may need to do more to emphasize such differences in final weeks of campaign</p>

        <p>Gov. George W. Bush's confident performance at the presidential debate on Wednesday night rested in part on the skillful way he portrayed the differences between himself and Vice President Al Gore. On issues ranging from hate crimes to prescription drugs, the environment and education, he spoke as if he and Mr. Gore were pursuing the same goals by somewhat different means. The new, subdued Al Gore let pass several opportunities to rebut Mr. Bush's characterizations. That may be a smart tactic, but it does little to clarify the policy record of the campaign. There is nothing ''fuzzy,'' to use the governor's words, about many differences between the two candidates.</p>
        <p>The vice president roused himself at the end of the debate to note that the issue did not concern Mr. Bush's ''compassion'' or ''heart,'' but his priorities. The governor has become effective at declaring his support for schools, the environment and defense, but his $1.3 trillion tax cut, heavily weighted toward the wealthy, would soak up almost all of the non-Social Security and non-Medicare budget surplus, leaving little or no room for any significant increases in spending in these areas.</p>

        <p>Gov. George W. Bush's confident performance at the presidential debate on Wednesday night rested in part on the skillful way he portrayed the differences between himself and Vice President Al Gore. On issues ranging from hate crimes to prescription drugs, the environment and education, he spoke as if he and Mr. Gore were pursuing the same goals by somewhat different means. The new, subdued Al Gore let pass several opportunities to rebut Mr. Bush's characterizations. That may be a smart tactic, but it does little to clarify the policy record of the campaign. There is nothing ''fuzzy,'' to use the governor's words, about many differences between the two candidates.</p>
        <p>The vice president roused himself at the end of the debate to note that the issue did not concern Mr. Bush's ''compassion'' or ''heart,'' but his priorities. The governor has become effective at declaring his support for schools, the environment and defense, but his $1.3 trillion tax cut, heavily weighted toward the wealthy, would soak up almost all of the non-Social Security and non-Medicare budget surplus, leaving little or no room for any significant increases in spending in these areas.</p>
        <p>On Social Security, Mr. Bush's proposal to divert a sixth of the Social Security taxes out of the system and into investment accounts for future retirees might be welcomed by young people -- until they realized that draining off that money would impose substantial risk for both retirees and the system itself.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush proclaimed his support for the environment and even said that he cared about global warming. Mr. Gore used the debate to reiterate support for partnerships with industry to reduce the consumption of fossil fuels, while Mr. Bush falsely described the Kyoto agreement by asserting that it forced the United States to go it alone on making environmental changes. In fact, the agreement was signed with the understanding that in the future, developing countries like China and India would be persuaded to be a part of it, with help from the West in developing new technologies. The difference between the two contenders was the difference between ignoring a major problem and confronting it with analysis and painstaking negotiations.</p>
        <p>Money makes the difference between the two candidates' proposals especially acute in the health sphere and education. Mr. Gore's proposals do not constitute a giant step toward universal coverage, but the money he would spend would get the country there faster than Mr. Bush's. The governor also misstated reality when he said that the percentage  of people with health insurance was going up in Texas but down in the United States at large. In fact, between 1998 and 1999, both percentages rose, after falling for several years. For schools, Mr. Bush says he wants to increase accountability, but he does not provide much money to help local districts get there.</p>
        <p>The governor said he was tolerant of gays, but he apparently regards anti-discrimination protections for them as ''special rights.'' As Mr. Gore noted, Mr. Bush did nothing to support a hate-crimes bill for gays in Texas. On gun control, Mr. Bush said he favored ''instant background checks'' for guns purchased at gun shows, but he opposes a three-day waiting period that would give law enforcement agencies the time to do more thorough checks. Taken together, these are stark differences that Mr. Gore may need to do more to emphasize in the final weeks of the campaign.</p>
