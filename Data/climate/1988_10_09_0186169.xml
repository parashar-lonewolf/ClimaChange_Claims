        <p>LEAD: Ross Fleisig's ''Nuclear Phobia Over Shoreham''  [ Opinion, Aug. 21 ]  is both informative and welcome, because I am convinced numerous people do favor use of the completed power station to end Nassau and Suffolk energy problems.</p>
        <p>Ross Fleisig's ''Nuclear Phobia Over Shoreham''  [ Opinion, Aug. 21 ]  is both informative and welcome, because I am convinced numerous people do favor use of the completed power station to end Nassau and Suffolk energy problems.</p>
        <p>Not dismissing any past managerial ineptitude within the Long Island Lighting Company, their $5.3 billion, technically optimum, competently staffed facility was largely aborted by two factors.</p>
        <p>First, the widely inflamed fears, while vocal local honchos also blocked evacuation drill cooperation; yet across the Sound Millstones 1, 2 and 3 operate at Waterford, Conn., and Indian Point is in congested Westchester County. Each of those could affect us.</p>
        <p>Second, political opportunism that has left state consumer advocate Richard Kessel defending very possibly worse ensuing consequences for the electric ratepayers than if Shoreham went on line. Governor Mario Cuomo's adamant allied position regarding this whole deal remains at least bewildering.</p>
        <p>The planned compensatory fossil-fuel generators releasing more carbon dioxide out here would hardly enhance our renowned ocean air environment, or even an already troubled terrestrial biosphere.  PETER A. LEAVENS  Freeport</p>
