        <p>Convinced that its effort to revamp the Clean Air Act is stalemated in Congress, the Bush administration is pushing the policies, which govern pollution from power plants, through regulation rather than legislation.</p>
        <p>This week the Environmental Protection Agency plans to release a pair of proposals that closely track President Bush's proposed amendments to the Clean Air Act, known as the Clear Skies Initiative.</p>
        <p>The regulations share the same timelines, limits and trading mechanisms for three of the main pollutants released from burning fossil fuels: mercury, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides.</p>
        <p>The proposals would expand the current pollution trading systems for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides and introduce a new one for mercury. The trading systems are modeled after one that even environmental groups consider successful. It has reduced the sulfur dioxide that causes acid rain by allowing companies to buy and sell a limited set of rights to pollute.</p>
        <p>In late October, Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton and other cabinet-level administrators met to deliberate on backing this approach. Documents from the meeting, titled ''Administrative Approach for Achieving Clear Skies,'' state that ''as a fallback approach in the event that Congress does not make progress on Clear Skies legislation this year'' the committee was convened to consider ''how to achieve the goals of the president's Clear Skies Initiative via an administrative approach using existing Clean Air Act authority.''</p>
        <p>This approach has raised criticism in some quarters.</p>
        <p>''The federal government is literally rewriting the clean air rules to give the worst actors a free pass to pollute in perpetuity,'' said James E. McGreevey, the governor of New Jersey, which introduced its own statewide mercury regulations for power plants last week.</p>
        <p>Industry, though, has advocated an overhaul for the Clean Air Act since President Bush's earliest months in office.</p>
        <p>In an April 2001 speech to the Western Coal Transport Group, Quin Shea, an electric industry lobbyist for the Edison Electric Institute, acknowledged that the chances of getting the Clean Air Act amended by Congress were ''fairly low,'' according to transcripts on the National Coal Transport Association Web site. ''Having said that, the president is prepared to do this administratively,'' Mr. Shea said, noting that the effort would not be ''as robust'' but that ''the goal here will be to gain a foothold, an irreversible foothold on the next generation'' of pollution controls.</p>
        <p>Proponents of pollution markets call them efficient and flexible, arguing that the acid rain program brought down sulfur dioxide faster and more cheaply than expected.</p>
        <p>''The cap and trade approach shows us again and again that people do more and they do it faster when they have an incentive to do what's in the public's interest,'' said Michael O. Leavitt, the E.P.A. administrator, in his first speech to employees a few weeks ago.</p>
        <p>But a number of senators, state officials and environmental advocacy groups oppose the president's market-based proposal, especially for the toxic pollutant mercury.</p>
        <p>Unregulated mercury emissions from coal-burning power plants have become a rising concern in recent years. About 48 tons of mercury are emitted each year from power plants, about 40 percent of total man-made emissions in the country.</p>
        <p>The administration's market proposal would put a nationwide limit at 15 tons in the year 2015, with no interim limits stated.</p>
        <p>In contrast, the E.P.A. used traditional controls for hazardous pollutants under the Clean Air Act to bring down mercury from medical waste incinerators, another major source, to about 5 tons today.</p>
        <p>While environmental groups are opposed to any mercury trading, some E.P.A. officials and senators say there is some value in building trading into regulations. One proposal backed by Senator Thomas R. Carper, Democrat of Delaware, and three Republican senators also allows trading once individual plants achieve a 70 percent reduction. A proposal that was sent by E.P.A. employees to the White House early last year also used this hybrid approach.</p>
        <p>The agency's effort to allow a pollution trading system for mercury is almost certain to be challenged in court if it is ever made final.</p>
        <p>''That's riddled with legal problems,'' said Ann Berwick, who formerly handled environmental litigation for the Massachusetts attorney general and now works as an industry lobbyist for companies that oppose President Bush's plan.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the documents from the cabinet-level meeting acknowledge that while a ''coordinated administrative approach to the three pollutants is good policy for the electric utility industry,'' the approach is ''legally vulnerable.''</p>
