        <p>Paul D. Wolfowitz defended himself vigorously on Monday, declaring that it would be ''unjust and frankly hypocritical'' for the World Bank's board to find him guilty of ethical lapses. But he also hinted that he would discuss whether to resign as bank president if the board cleared him of misconduct.</p>
        <p>Appearing before a committee of the bank's board of directors and going on the attack after weeks of silence, Mr. Wolfowitz also charged that he had been the victim of ''orchestrated leaks of false, misleading, incomplete and personal information'' intended to ''undermine my effectiveness as president.''</p>
        <p>''The goal of this smear campaign, I believe, is to create a self-fulfilling prophecy that I am an ineffective leader and must step down for that reason alone, even if the ethics charges are unwarranted,'' he said. ''I, for one, will not give in to such tactics. And I will not resign in the face of a plainly bogus charge of conflict of interest.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wolfowitz's lawyer released his client's comments in a statement on Monday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wolfowitz's defiant response left unclear what would happen next, but many at the bank saw it as a prelude to his eventual departure if negotiations could lead to the board's endorsement of his claim that he had acted in good faith, not favoritism, in arranging for a pay increase for Shaha Ali Riza, his companion, in 2005. She was, at the time, being transferred to the State Department, but continued to receive her salary from the bank.</p>
        <p>The seven-member committee of the bank's board also heard testimony Monday afternoon from Ms. Riza, who charged that she had been unjustly pushed out of the bank by ''a powerful group'' there that had been hostile to her over other matters.</p>
        <p>Ethics officials ordered Mr. Wolfowitz in 2005 to arrange for her transfer out of the bank with some form of compensation, which ended up being a salary increase and a promotion that have drawn fire from critics. Those officials are also to testify before the committee.</p>
        <p>The board committee is to digest the testimony, decide whether Mr. Wolfowitz violated any rules in his direct role in the compensation package, give him a chance to respond, and forward its final recommendation to the 24-member board by Thursday.</p>
        <p>The board could then take action on the matter by the end of the week. But some bank officials say there could also be a parallel negotiation with Mr. Wolfowitz.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wolfowitz's hint that he might be receptive to a deal was in the last paragraph of the seven-page statement released by the office of his lawyer, Robert S. Bennett, shortly after the bank president read it in a private session at the World Bank headquarters in Washington. At the end of the day, Mr. Wolfowitz sent it by e-mail to bank employees.</p>
        <p>''Only when the cloud of these unfair and untrue charges is removed, will it be truly possible to determine objectively whether I can be an effective leader of the World Bank,'' Mr. Wolfowitz said, in what was widely seen at the bank as an indication he would consider resigning.</p>
        <p>The statement appeared to show his recognition of the loss of confidence he has suffered among a growing number of officials, for several reasons. Among those reasons have been his crackdown on corruption and his reliance on a small group of close aides brought from the Bush administration, where he had served as deputy defense secretary and an architect of the Iraq war.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wolfowitz has also come under fire as internal documents have surfaced indicating that his aides may have pressed for Bush administration policies downplaying the importance of global warming and opposing contraceptives and abortion in family planning programs.</p>
        <p>Any negotiation about Mr. Wolfowitz's future would probably include a discussion about preserving the prerogative of the United States to choose the next World Bank president. The discussion may also include a compensation package if he resigns, bank officials said. Mr. Wolfowitz's annual salary is $400,000 after taxes, according to bank officials.</p>
        <p>The main event of the day was Mr. Wolfowitz's statement, accompanied by a 17-page submission from his lawyers constituting an extraordinary public rebuttal to accusations that have roiled the bank for three weeks, after his direct role in Ms. Riza's pay package came to light.</p>
        <p>The White House has consistently supported Mr. Wolfowitz, and on Monday, President Bush did so again, though in a low-key manner.</p>
        <p>''My position is that he ought to stay,'' Mr. Bush said. ''He ought to be given a fair hearing.'' He said he did not discuss the matter with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Merkel, who was in town for a European Union meeting with Mr. Bush, in a news conference called only for ''a very transparent, very candid conversation'' about Mr. Wolfowitz's future. European officials say Mrs. Merkel favors Mr. Wolfowitz's resignation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wolfowitz's defense was striking in that it singled out three longtime bank officials as having specifically ordered him to handle Ms. Riza's compensation package himself in 2005. He said they were Roberto Danino, the general counsel; Xavier Coll, vice president for human resources; and Ad Melkert, head of the bank board's ethics committee.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wolfowitz's statement appeared to back up a narrative that critics and supporters at the bank said was underlying the crisis. According to that narrative, those officials essentially wanted to rid themselves of the matter of Ms. Riza, who felt wronged by being asked to sacrifice to make way for Mr. Wolfowitz, and that it was best left to Mr. Wolfowitz to placate her.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wolfowitz said that contrary to the recollections of some officials at the bank, those officials ''surely knew'' of her salary increase. ''Certainly they had access to that information if they wanted it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''In sum, in working to resolve the potential conflict of interest that was created by my and Ms. Riza's relationship, I acted transparently, sought and received guidance from the bank's ethics committee, and conducted myself in good faith in accordance with that guidance,'' he said. Ms. Riza's salary, in excess of $190,000, is in the same range as that drawn by about 1,000 other bank employees, Mr. Wolfowitz said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Melkert, in a statement on Monday, challenged Mr. Wolfowitz's recollections and said he was not aware of the amount of Ms. Riza's compensation when he declared in 2005 and in early 2006 that the matter was settled to his satisfaction. He is to testify before the board's committee on Tuesday, officials said.</p>
        <p>Allegations that Mr. Melkert was ''aware of or had somehow approved the specifics'' of her pay and relocation ''are false,'' said a statement issued by his office at the United Nations Development Program, where he is a top official.</p>
        <p>Late Monday night, Mr. Danino, the former general counsel, also disputed Mr. Wolfowitz's recollection of events, saying he had no role in determining Ms. Riza's salary and believed it was a conflict of interest for the bank president to decide it.</p>
