        <p>Closing the Indian Point nuclear reactors would make electricity more expensive, leave New York more vulnerable to natural gas shortages and add to pollution that causes global warming, according to a report released on Tuesday by a committee of the National Academy of Sciences.</p>
        <p>The committee said that there were no insurmountable technical obstacles to closing the plant. But it asserted that electric demand was growing so fast in the region, and building power plants was so difficult, that simply meeting power needs during peak periods would be a challenge even if the reactors stayed in operation.</p>
        <p>Congress provided $1 million for the study, under a bill sponsored by Nita M. Lowey, a Westchester Democrat who says the reactors should be closed because of the risk of a release of radiation through accident or terrorist attack.</p>
        <p>Despite the report's conclusion that closing Indian Point, which is about 35 miles north of Midtown Manhattan, would present major difficulties for the state, Ms. Lowey said in a phone interview that she was ''thrilled'' by its findings. ''To me, the bottom line is, where there's a will there's a way'' to close the plant, she said.</p>
        <p>She pointed out that the National Academy group said the extra costs from closing Indian Point would be "modest," provided there is time to compensate, by building new plants or improving efficiency.</p>
        <p>In fact, the report emphasized the political problems of meeting the state's energy demands, with or without the reactors.</p>
        <p>''While the committee is optimistic that technical solutions do exist for the replacement of Indian Point, it is considerably less confident that the necessary political, regulatory, financial and institutional mechanisms are in place to facilitate the timely implementation of these replacement options,'' the report said.</p>
        <p>The continuing fight over Indian Point comes as nuclear power is anticipating a renaissance, mainly because of the high price of natural gas. It has been nearly 30 years since the last plant was ordered, but nine companies have said publicly that they are considering building new ones around the country, including one in Scriba, N.Y., adjacent to the Nine Mile Point complex.</p>
        <p>At the moment building any power plant in New York State is difficult, the report said, because a law that laid out the process for environmental reviews and permits for new plants was allowed to expire in 2003.</p>
        <p>The amount of generating capacity under construction now is inadequate to meet peak demand in 2009, and the shortfall will be far larger if Indian Point closes, the report said. In seven to nine years, the area will need 3,000 megawatts of additional electric capacity if Indian Point is running, and 5,000 megawatts if it is not, the report said.</p>
        <p>One of the authors, Parker D. Mathusa, said in a telephone interview that there were big opportunities for improving efficiency of electric use and expanding electric production. But Mr. Mathusa, a member of the board of directors of the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, said that ''to replace 2,000 megawatts of base-load power, very low-cost power, in a critical part of the country that is growing, with air quality that is some of the worst in the country, one would have to pause.''</p>
        <p>Jim Steets, a spokesman for Entergy, which owns the reactors, said that it was no surprise that the panel found that Indian Point could be replaced. ''Of course you can do anything if you try hard enough,'' he said. ''You can put a man on the moon, too. Whether that's the right thing to do or not, it doesn't really answer.''</p>
        <p>A business group supported by Entergy that favors operation of the plants, the New York Affordable Reliable Electricity Alliance, says that the report showed that shutting down the reactors would cause ''extreme economic and environmental sacrifices on the part of New Yorkers who are already faced with record high energy prices, poor air quality, and concerns over reliable sources of power in the near future,'' said Jerry Kremer, an advisor to the group.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kremer, a former state assemblyman who helped write the law that has expired, said: ''At the moment, there's no private capital being invested in New York for power plants. The communities don't want it and the siting law doesn't exist.''</p>
        <p>The report said one alternative to Indian Point was something else that environmentalists do not like: ports for tankers carrying liquefied natural gas. In fact, natural gas, which now sells for more than double its price in the late 1990's, is the only fuel practical for large-scale plants in the New York City area, according to experts, because coal or new reactors are not politically acceptable.</p>
        <p>And closing the reactors would run counter to another environmental effort, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, which is supposed to start cutting carbon dioxide output in the region in 2008, the study said.</p>
        <p>The two reactors make up only about 5.3 percent of the state's generating capacity but they produce 10.1 percent of its energy, the study said, because they are low-cost producers and are run around the clock nearly all year long. Closing them would push electricity rates up, but it did not say how much.</p>
        <p>Some activists have tried for decades to close the plants, but the campaign drew more momentum after the attacks of Sept.11, 2001; American Airlines 11, the plane that hit the north tower of the World Trade Center, flew down the Hudson River, over Indian Point, on the way.</p>
        <p>Indian Point's two operating reactors have initial licenses that expire in 2013 and 2015, but Entergy, the owner, has invested heavily in both plants, working to raise their power output, and is expected to seek 20-year extensions of their licenses.</p>
        <p>The company is building a storage pad outside the buildings to house casks of highly radioactive spent nuclear fuel, because the waste will soon fill the pools that were designed to hold it.</p>
        <p>The fuel has become a factor in the debate. As the report noted, if the reactors were closed, the vulnerability of the fuel to attack would not initially change. But Ms. Lowey pointed out that the fuel could be moved out of pools and into dry casks, perhaps at some distant location, a few years after the plant is shut; if the plant is never shut, she said, hazardous used fuel will always be on site.</p>
