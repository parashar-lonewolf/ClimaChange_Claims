        <p>STARTING in the 15th century, Europe and North America entered a period of climatic cooling that lasted, on and off, for some six centuries. Scientists believe that the average global surface temperature dropped about 1 to 3 degrees Fahrenheit below today's. During the worst of the cold, harvests failed and there was starving in Europe, and people could walk across New York Harbor on the ice.</p>
        <p>But scientists have been uncertain as to whether this Little Ice Age was a global phenomenon, and if so,  whether it affected various parts of the world simultaneously.</p>
        <p>New evidence from Greenland and Antarctica suggests that it was both global and simultaneous, at least at the start. A group of researchers at the University of New Hampshire reports in the current issue of the journal Science that atmospheric circulation patterns in both the North Atlantic and the South Pacific shifted into their Little Ice Age mode at about the same time, around A.D. 1400.</p>
        <p>By analyzing annual snow layers preserved in ice cores, the researchers discovered that greater amounts of sea salts appeared in the layers at that time. This, they said, indicated that stronger winds were blowing off both the northern and southern oceans -- a sign that circulation had been strengthened by cooler arctic and near-arctic temperatures.</p>
        <p>This circulation pattern is still in place today, even though the world is warmer, the researchers said. One implication is that the Little Ice Age may have been ''artificially'' ended in the 20th century by global warming brought on by emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases, said Karl J. Kreutz, the lead author of the report in Science.</p>
        <p>If that is the case, he speculated, ''perhaps we haven't seen the full amount of warming'' that would have been expected by now from the greenhouse gases.</p>
