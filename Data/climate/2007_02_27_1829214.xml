        <p>The victory of ''The Departed'' at the Oscars on Sunday night represented many things: fair tribute to Martin Scorsese, recognition of the movie's brute force at the box office, and an acknowledgment that stars not only make movies, they make the movie.</p>
        <p>But something else could be read between the spaces of the field-leading four statues that this Warner Brothers movie won. Old-line Hollywood studios, confronted over the last few years by indifferent audiences and an insurgent collection of independent film makers, declared dominion over the industry's crowning event.</p>
        <p>Last year the industry was a bystander at its own party and was probably left to wonder how an event conceived for studio self-congratulation had been kidnapped by a bunch of people who couldn't get a good table at Ivy if their lives depended on it. The first part of this year's Academy Awards seemed to following the same script: a polyglot of languages, cobbled-together indie efforts and little movies that accomplished big things.</p>
        <p>But as the evening progressed, you could see old-line Hollywood bolting down the Big Win. Beginning with the editing award given to Thelma Schoonmaker, a longtime Scorsese collaborator, it became clear that while the wistful charms of ''Little Miss Sunshine'' found an audience, and while the Academy sure appreciated the sweeping global themes of ''Babel,'' a brawling, big-budget popcorn movie was going to finish in the money.</p>
        <p>And in case anyone missed the point, when it came time to give out best director, three of the directors who more or less invented the modern studio picture -- George Lucas, Steven Spielberg and Francis Ford Coppola -- stepped up to the stage. A riff about who had all the Oscars among the bunch followed, ending with an Oscar-less Mr. Lucas saying, ''It is better to give than receive.''</p>
        <p>Big belly laugh there, because everyone in the room knew better, a point Messrs. Spielberg and Coppola made jokingly clear. (Mr. Lucas was given the Thalberg Award in 1991.)</p>
        <p>It was less poignant than telling that these four men, Mr. Scorsese included, were onstage together, having become what they once assailed. They are the establishment, and they are not ready to cede the field to a moshed-up world of indies and global filmmakers. ''The Departed'' was put together by Brad Grey, who now runs a studio (Paramount), was pushed through by Graham King, a master of the nexus between talent and studio, and included many of the marquee names in the business: Jack Nicholson, Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon chief among them.</p>
        <p>So, in a way, the fix was in. The absence of ''Dreamgirls,'' a strong studio film that went to the wall early on Oscar ambitions and got clobbered, left ''The Departed'' as the only film that was conceived, executed and marketed out of a big corner office, in this case, the one belonging to Alan F. Horn of Warner Brothers.</p>
        <p>It was up against an indie charmer, ''Little Miss Sunshine''; a British-inspired biography, ''The Queen''; a globally ambitious film from a studio specialty division, ''Babel''; and a gorgeous afterthought of a film, ''Letters From Iwo Jima,'' which was rendered in Japanese.</p>
        <p>From the start Warner Brothers, never known as an Oscar powerhouse in terms of marketing or results, played rope-a-dope, keeping the film's prospects in relative stealth mode (unlike ''Dreamgirls'') and allowing voters to come to it instead of the other way around. It ended nicely for the studio, including another big victory in the form of ''Happy Feet'' lapping Pixar and Disney's ''Cars'' for the animation victory.</p>
        <p>''It's a wonderful affirmation of what we set out to do, which is to support great filmmakers in their quest to make movies that deliver for audiences,'' Mr. Horn said.</p>
        <p>''Welcome to the Club'' said The Los Angeles Times in its headline for the Oscars news on Monday, a headline that could be diced another way and suggest that the club, while theoretically open to all, remains an artifact of the studio culture.</p>
        <p>''Last night proved that the Academy Awards is a major international event, as evidenced by the nominees from all over the world,'' said Michael Barker, co-president of Sony Pictures Classics, a specialty division of Sony (which won best foreign-language film for ''The Lives of Others''). ''There were indies and foreign efforts that received a lot of recognition. But best picture, best director and best screenplay all went to a big studio film, which suggests that American films are still at the center of the culture.''</p>
        <p>Wags may note that ''The Departed,'' with its themes of betrayal, power lust and shifting alliances, mirrors life on the studio lot. They would not be far off. Mr. King had said before and after the awards that Mr. Grey deserved to be credited as a producer of the film, but when he got his moment on the stage, he ticked off over a dozen names. Even Idi Amin got a shout out, but Mr. Grey did not, and at the end of the night it was Mr. Graham standing in the middle of the Vanity Fair party holding Oscar in his big, meaty paw.</p>
        <p>That is not how the game, at least in modern Hollywood, is played. It was sort of fitting that a movie about rats and double-agents marked the repossession of the Oscars. What's mine is mine, the thinking goes, and what's yours might be mine too.</p>
        <p>In the press room Mr. Scorsese acknowledged that it was a reunion of sorts that was underway. ''We go back, Steven and I go back to '68, '69. Francis Coppola, 1970. George, 1970,'' said Mr. Scorsese.</p>
        <p>And we go back with them. The studios have made efforts to adopt the tools of the insurgency by developing specialty divisions and buying indie creations that emerged far from the studio lot: ''An Inconvenient Truth'' made a lot of money for Paramount in addition to creating awareness about global warming.</p>
        <p>But in the end the studios still want to be able to set up a tent as they see fit and invite people in. This year that worked fine.</p>
