        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>At the White House conference on global climate change (news article, Oct. 7), President Clinton made it clear that there would be no tax increases for fossil fuel energy as a means to encourage the economy to shift away from this principal source of carbon emissions. The President would speak up only for improved technology, arguing that a climate change treaty with such taxes would get nowhere in the Senate.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>At the White House conference on global climate change (news article, Oct. 7), President Clinton made it clear that there would be no tax increases for fossil fuel energy as a means to encourage the economy to shift away from this principal source of carbon emissions. The President would speak up only for improved technology, arguing that a climate change treaty with such taxes would get nowhere in the Senate.</p>
        <p>The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development estimates that in its member countries about 30 percent of all emissions of carbon, a major greenhouse gas, emanates from transportation, mostly cars and trucks. Except for the European Union, the major energy users of the planet are unwilling to commit to fixed goals and timetables for reducing carbon emissions. What is to be done if gas taxes are unthinkable?</p>
        <p>One place to look is at Mexico City, which has had auto controls in place since 1989. This policy of a no-driving day may be the beginning of a plan that environmentalists, politicians, the public and economists can accept as a method for wringing contributions to greenhouse gas reductions out of the transport sector and  taking pressure off fixed emissions sources.</p>

        <p>The writer is a professor of economics at the University of Cincinnati.</p>
