        <p>LEAD: President Reagan is coming to Canada in a few days to talk about free trade, among other things, and he'll get a mixed reception.</p>
        <p>President Reagan is coming to Canada in a few days to talk about free trade, among other things, and he'll get a mixed reception.</p>
        <p>Canadian labor is against the free trade initiative. Some big-business nationalists are taking out full-page red-ink ads in the newspapers to inform the President that Canada is ''not for sale,'' but he'll get a friendly welcome from Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mulroney is no ''patsy'' for Mr. Reagan, as many of his opponents say. Vice President Bush and Secretary of the Treasury James Baker were up here in January and the Prime Minister made clear to them in private that he opposed the President's policies on South Africa and Central America and would not allow his Government to cooperate in Mr. Reagan's ''Star Wars'' program.</p>
        <p>The Prime Minister has other complaints. As he made clear in an interview here the other day, he opposes Washington's request for free passage of its warships through the Northwest Passage, and he thinks the President has been slow in dealing with the acid rain and trade problems.</p>
        <p>On two major issues, however, he is on President Reagan's side. The expansion of trade is one of them, and the other is the President's renewed efforts to reach a verifiable treaty with the Soviet Union on the control of nuclear weapons.</p>
        <p>These Mr. Mulroney regards as historic opportunities that come once in a lifetime, and his concern is that the Canadian and American people are not as well aware as they should be to the possibilities.</p>
        <p>How many people in the United States, he asks, know that the province of Ontario alone does more trade with the U.S. than Japan does?</p>
        <p>He recalls that former President Nixon said that Japan was America's best customer. Not so, he says. ''We do $200 billion of business a year with the U.S. - the largest two-way trade between nations anywhere in the world.''</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, he adds, we must keep producing and expanding, and cooperating. ''As a matter of highest priority, we want an agreement -fair to both sides - that ends the threat to Canadian industry from U.S. protectionists who harass and restrict our exports through the misuse of trade remedy laws.''</p>
        <p>No doubt, Mr. Mulroney says, that the U.S. has justifiable grievances against nations that indulge in unfair trade practices, but Canada is not one of them and does not want to be punished for other nations' wrongs.</p>
        <p>''We in Canada are given a choice,'' he says, ''We can look inward and hope for the best. We can pretend to shelter what we already have while ignoring the realities of the world around us. Or we can look outward, confidently, and take the future in our own hands.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mulroney sees the trade treaty, which will be voted up or down early next year, not merely in bilateral but in world terms. For the first time in history, he observes, all the nations are having to adjust to a revolutionary world economy, where the old assumptions of unrestricted national sovereignty are out of date.</p>
        <p>Ever since the U.S.-Canadian Boundary Waters Agreement of 1909, he recalls, our two countries have been cooperating for the common good. He quotes Winston Churchill: ''That long frontier from the Atlantic to the Pacific oceans, guarded only by neighborly respect and honorable obligations, is an example for every country and a pattern for the future of the world.''</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Mulroney was in China recently, listening to complaints about American imperialism. ''How many divisions do the Soviets have on the Chinese border  [ 60 ]  and how many do you have on the Soviet border?'' he asks. ''All we have are a few customs and border guards. That is some difference.''</p>
        <p>Considering all this, it's odd that secondary considerations impede the Reagan-Mulroney trade talks. Challenging Canada's control of the Northwest Passage illustrates the point. Mr. Reagan is willing to recognize Canada's sovereignty over the passage, provided Canada allows our military and commercial ships to use it as they please. This is a mysterious Pentagon demand, because if the Northwest Passage were declared an international waterway, the Russians also could send their surface warships and submarines through it at will.</p>
        <p>The chances are, however, that the President and the Prime Minister will reach agreement on this and on a trade treaty, despite the protests of the Pentagon, the labor unions and the industrial polluters.</p>
        <p>For much larger issues are at stake in the effort to create a better world order in the last years of the century, and both the President and the Prime Minister know that much depends on how Canada and the U.S. and the Common Market in Europe lead the way.</p>
