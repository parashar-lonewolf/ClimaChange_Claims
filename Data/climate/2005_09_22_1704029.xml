        <p>On a typical night in New Orleans, Clarence Frogman Henry could be heard in a Bourbon Street club singing his 1956 hit, the one where he proves he can sing like a girl or a frog. On Tuesday night Mr. Henry cooed and croaked it at Madison Square Garden, and suddenly there was poignancy in the song's title: ''Ain't Got No Home.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Henry was part of the lineup of New Orleans musicians and million-selling pop acts at a Madison Square Garden benefit concert and pay-per-view broadcast, ''From the Big Apple to the Big Easy.'' It was expected to raise $8 million to $10 million for Hurricane Katrina relief and rebuilding efforts. A companion concert, featuring jam bands, took place at Radio City Music Hall.</p>
        <p>Although the city has been devastated, its musicians persevere. The headliners who helped fill the $500 seats included Elton John, Jimmy Buffett, Simon and Garfunkel and John Fogerty. But the musicians from New Orleans -- among them the Neville Brothers, the original Meters, Irma Thomas, Kermit Ruffins and the Dirty Dozen Brass Band -- outsang and outfunked most of the better-known stars. The programming was smart: New Orleans musicians had the first and last words, in the form of parade music from the Rebirth Brass Band.</p>
        <p>New Orleans music, from jazz to hip-hop (which wasn't represented at the concert), has a distinctive rolling swing that's directly derived from community celebrations. It's deeply connected to Mardi Gras songs (like ''Iko Iko'' and ''Brother John,'' which the Dixie Cups sang on Tuesday night, and ''Hey Pocky Way'' performed by the Meters and the Neville Brothers) and brass-band music for funerals and parades.</p>
        <p>Famously musical New Orleans neighborhoods like Trem√© and the Ninth Ward were hit hard by the flooding; how they will be rebuilt, and who will return, is still an open question and one that worries New Orleans musicians. ''Nothing's going to be the same,'' said Ms. Thomas, the 64-year-old queen of New Orleans rhythm and blues. ''But by the same token, what ever is? The main thing is to bring everybody back, because that's the ambience of the city.''</p>
        <p>But for the moment, it didn't matter that the performers' homes and neighborhoods have been damaged. They were executing the old African-American alchemy of tribulation into joy.</p>
        <p>The politics of New Orleans's plight were not entirely sidelined. Bette Midler said, ''I could stand up here and talk for hours about ineptitude, stupidity, blame, inequality, global warming, the dangerous destruction of the wetlands, but if I did, what would all those other people have to talk about?'' She was loudly booed after mocking President Bush. Former President Bill Clinton, who introduced Mr. Fogerty, received a long ovation.</p>
        <p>Cyril Neville, of the Neville Brothers, wore a T-shirt reading, ''Ethnic cleansing in New Orleans''; his brother Aaron wore a baseball cap reading, ''Evacuee.'' And when the Meters sang ''People Say,'' their bassist, George Porter Jr., said, ''People want to know -- do we have a right to live?''</p>
        <p>Backstage, Ms. Thomas said that both her house and the club she owns, the Lion's Den, were badly flooded. ''We're among the New Orleans easters who lost everything,'' she said. ''But we're gonna be all right.'' Onstage, backed by Ry Cooder, Lenny Kravitz and Buckwheat Zydeco, she sang a riveting, unsparing version of Bessie Smith's ''Backwater Blues'': ''When it thunders and lightnin' and the wind begins to blow/ There's thousands of people ain't got no place to go.''</p>
        <p>Aaron Neville joined Simon and Garfunkel for ''Bridge Over Troubled Water,'' and he followed Art Garfunkel's rickety, overwrought verse with one that was tender, idiosyncratic and delicately poised; later, with his brothers, he sang a humbly devout ''Amazing Grace.'' The Meters, who defined New Orleans funk in their own songs and as a studio band, regrouped for one song, then merged with the Neville Brothers (who include Art Neville of the Meters). And Kermit Ruffins, a trumpeter and singer, growled a steamy ''St. James Infirmary'' with the Dirty Dozen.</p>
        <p>Louisiana musicians also propelled strong performances by non-natives. Elvis Costello belted ''The Monkey Speaks His Mind'' with the Dirty Dozen and the song's writer, Dave Bartholomew, and found the scorn and vitriol in Allen Toussaint's ''On Your Way Down,'' with Mr. Toussaint at the piano. Diana Krall, also with the Dirty Dozen, dug into the Fats Domino hit ''I'm Walkin'.'' And with Buckwheat Zydeco, from Lafayette, on accordion, Mr. Cooder sang another Domino song, ''My Girl Josephine,'' with a knowing rasp.</p>
        <p>The longest segments went to the rock stars. Mr. Fogerty, a Californian who mythologized the bayou, played rowdy, twangy versions of his Creedence Clearwater Revival songs. Jimmy Buffett, who is from Mississippi, played his good-timey, Caribbean-tinged sailing songs with a Louisiana musician, Sonny Landreth, on slide guitar. Elton John performed his dramatic instrumental, ''Funeral for a Friend,'' with images of the hurricane's floods and fires behind him; then he sang ''Someone Saved My Life Tonight'' and ''Levon,'' two songs that sound so gospel-like and inspirational that their lyrics grew irrelevant.</p>
        <p>An unexpected consequence of the hurricane is that it has focused attention on New Orleans's music, with all its local quirks and underappreciated genius. Ms. Thomas, for instance, is recording an album while she's in New York. With luck, the sounds of New Orleans will remind the world that rebuilding the Crescent City is not only a commercial project but also a cultural one.</p>
