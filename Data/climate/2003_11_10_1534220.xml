        <p>Two very different kinds of goodbyes fill the new albums by Sarah McLachlan and Pink. Ms. McLachlan's songs revolve around the private partings of lovers who can't let go, while Pink revels in one loud, decisive heave-ho after another.</p>
        <p>'Afterglow'  Sarah McLachlan</p>
        <p>Sarah McLachlan sounds more somber than ever on ''Afterglow'' (Arista), her first studio album since 1997. In hymnlike ballads and serenely melancholic waltzes, she ponders loves gone wrong and lives of solitary yearning.</p>
        <p>On past albums Ms. McLachlan has allowed herself some pleasure: in delirious kisses, in love that is ''better than chocolate.'' Not this time. Even in ''Push,'' the lone song on the album in which things seem to be working out, she praises her partner's constancy by enumerating her own flaws. When she glances upward from personal regrets, in ''World on Fire,'' she sees a hole in the ozone layer: ''We part the veil on our killer sun.''</p>
        <p>By all indications ''Afterglow'' is not autobiographical. Ms. McLachlan is married to her drummer, Ashwin Sood, and they have a daughter, India. But song after song is about love that the singer could not hold on to. She may blame herself, as she does for an unnamed irrevocable mistake in ''Fallen''; in ''Stupid,'' as a distorted guitar lashes into the music's foundation, she asks bitterly: ''How stupid could I be? A simpleton could see that you're no good for me.'' Or she may just decide, as she does in ''Dirty Little Secret,'' that ''there's nothing to be gained from this but disaster.''</p>
        <p>The vows of loyalty she makes in ''Answer'' may be addressed to someone who is never coming back. And in ''Drifting'' she tries to reach someone who has succumbed to stardom: ''The spotlight that follows wherever you go/ Does it light up the emptiness?''</p>
        <p>Her consolation is in the resonant introspection of the music, which carefully doles out its drama. Ms. McLachlan's voice is kindly, patient and long-suffering, often lingering on the verge of a sob without giving in. Her melodies tend to climb as her spirits sink, as when she sings to a potential new love, ''I'm a train wreck waiting to happen.''</p>
        <p>Ms. McLachlan and her producer, Pierre Marchand, make guitars and keyboards float around her like phantasms, likely at any moment to flicker into the electronic ether or disappear; in ''Time'' and ''Perfect Girl,'' choirs of her overdubbed voice arrive like seraphs. They can't resolve her unhappiness, but they can give it a dignified beauty.</p>
        <p>'Try This'  Pink</p>
        <p>Bravado is all that connects the many musical incarnations of Alecia Moore, better known as Pink, and it is more than enough. Pink has been through rhythm and blues, pop and the power-ballad confessions that she brought to her multimillion-selling 2001 album, ''Missundaztood'' (Arista). Her musical trappings tend to change with her producers and songwriting collaborators; she can strut through rock songs or moan rhythm and blues. Rock predominates on her new album, ''Try This'' (Arista), as she forges a new alliance with Tim Armstrong of Rancid.</p>
        <p>He doesn't exactly turn her into a punk rocker (although the album's final, hidden track savors distortion and four-letter words). Otherwise, Pink is not giving up her pop ambitions; the songs are wholeheartedly catchy and produced for radio play. But Mr. Armstrong helps pump up the aggressive side that separates Pink from the other high-gloss pop flirts on MTV.</p>
        <p>''I'm trouble, y'all; I disturb my town,'' she announces as the album begins, in a new-wave blare that Joan Jett would be proud of. Later, in ''Humble Neighborhoods,'' she sings over what could be a spiffed-up Clash track: ''Someday I'm gonna die, but it won't be from boredom.''</p>
        <p>Pink exorcised her traumas last time around with songs like ''Family Portrait.'' Now she can concentrate on the messiness of romance. She spends half of ''Try This'' dumping guys who have ticked her off: the one who didn't show up for her concert in ''Last to Know,'' and the one who wouldn't try to work things out in ''Walk Away,'' which chimes like a merger of folk-rock and a girl group. When Pink takes up a rippling 1970's-style soul ballad in ''Catch Me While I'm Sleeping,'' it is to tell someone, ''don't put your faith in me.'' In ''Try Too Hard,'' she lashes out at poseurs of all sorts, including herself: ''It's people like us that make me sick.''</p>
        <p>Pink's pose is one of brash determination that bulldozes any lingering insecurities: ''I'm troubled, I'm brilliant and I'm miserable, too/ That's what makes me so funny,'' she proclaims in ''Unwind.'' Pink shows just enough empathy (in ''Waiting for Love'' and ''Save My Life'') to prevent herself from being a tough-gal caricature, and she has a voice big enough to carry her pop instincts and her chutzpah.</p>
