        <p>EARLIER this month, Westchester County residents were visited by one of nature's most ferocious manifestations: a tornado. Most people in the county have never witnessed one of these monsters -- outside the occasional viewing of ''The Wizard of Oz.'' But on July 12, a funnel cloud formed over Grand View in Rockland County, crossed the Hudson River as a waterspout near the Tappan Zee Bridge, swept through Sleepy Hollow and still had enough punch at Hawthorne to flip over a police car before dissipating somewhere near Greenwich, Conn.</p>
        <p>Tornadoes develop about five times a year in New York State, but they normally frequent the state's southwest region, which is closer to the Midwest's tornado alley. Every two or three years, however, a tornado rips through the metropolitan area, bullying one burg or another.</p>

        <p>EARLIER this month, Westchester County residents were visited by one of nature's most ferocious manifestations: a tornado. Most people in the county have never witnessed one of these monsters -- outside the occasional viewing of ''The Wizard of Oz.'' But on July 12, a funnel cloud formed over Grand View in Rockland County, crossed the Hudson River as a waterspout near the Tappan Zee Bridge, swept through Sleepy Hollow and still had enough punch at Hawthorne to flip over a police car before dissipating somewhere near Greenwich, Conn.</p>
        <p>Tornadoes develop about five times a year in New York State, but they normally frequent the state's southwest region, which is closer to the Midwest's tornado alley. Every two or three years, however, a tornado rips through the metropolitan area, bullying one burg or another.</p>
        <p>The National Weather Service said Westchester's recent tornado was at the low end of the Fujita scale, which rates tornadoes by the damage they cause on a progressive scale from F0 (weak) to F5 (devastating, with winds 261 to 318 miles per hour). Westchester has experienced several weak tornadoes in recent years, the most recent of which was a June 2000 twister that (barely) struck Cortlandt.</p>
        <p>The most powerful tornado to hit the county was an F3 (severe, with winds 158 to 206 m.p.h.) at Chappaqua, on July 16, 1904. According to one report, the storm killed one person, destroyed two farmhouses and five barns and ''carried a pair of pants two miles.''</p>
        <p>As for New York City, an F3 barreled across Bergen County in New Jersey on July 13, 1895, killing three people near Hackensack before jumping off the Palisades, crossing the Hudson, and appearing briefly in Harlem. This was probably Manhattan's closest encounter with a major tornado since the arrival of Europeans.</p>
        <p>Is it conceivable that New York could one day be devastated by a powerful tornado? Yes, but the probability ranks somewhere around the odds of your winning next week's Lotto jackpot. Curiously, the biggest American cities seem to be immune from direct hits by major tornadoes. Chicago is in prime tornado country, yet the spinners seem to avoid the downtown as if the buildings were protected by kryptonite. Hollywood producers gleefully bring down nature's worst on the City of Angels. But Los Angeles, like New York, seems unlikely to experience the reality-show version of a twister.</p>
        <p>When extraordinary weather occurs these days, global warming is often the whipping boy. Although global warming may indeed contribute to an increase in some severe weather, including tropical storms, floods and heat waves, tornadoes thus far do not appear to be strengthened by higher temperatures. There has been no increase in the frequency or intensity of tornadoes in the past 20 years. Indeed, the United States has not experienced an F5 in seven years, the longest period without a monster tornado since reliable record-keeping began more than a century ago.</p>
        <p>Before that, however, several strong tornadoes did rake Queens and Brooklyn and outlying areas, including Westchester County in 1812.</p>
        <p>A powerful tornado struck Poughkeepsie in June 1794. The storm inspired the usual sense of awe and fright. But a local newspaper seemed to find meaning in the heavenly transport of one citizen. ''A lusty man,'' the paper reported, ''by the force of the wind was carried more than 60 feet in the air, and lodged against a stone wall and locust tree that joined it.''</p>
        <p>Lusty men of Poughkeepsie, be forewarned.</p>
