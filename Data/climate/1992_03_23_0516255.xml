        <p>A cold front bringing low, dark clouds and showers threatened to wash out the plans for launching the space shuttle Atlantis on Monday morning.</p>
        <p>Air Force meteorologists said there was only a 20 percent chance of acceptable weather at the scheduled time for liftoff, 8:01 A.M. Launching crews can wait two and a half hours for the weather to clear, after which the mission would have to be postponed at least 24 hours.</p>
        <p>The prospect for satisfactory weather on Tuesday was 50-50.</p>
        <p>Capt. Mike Adams, an Air Force weather officer for the Kennedy Space Center, said, "The forecast is very pessimistic." Study of the Atmosphere</p>
        <p>But technicians continued today to prepare for a launching of the planned eight-day flight, the second shuttle mission of the year and the 46th since the reusable spaceships began flying in 1981. Atlantis will be carrying an array of 12 scientific instruments for a comprehensive study of the earth's atmosphere.</p>
        <p>Leonard S. Nicholson, director of the shuttle program, said the Atlantis and its scientific cargo were in "superb" condition, with no problems cropping up since the countdown began Friday. "The only thing we're worried about is the weather," he said.</p>
        <p>Safety rules forbid launching the shuttles in the rain, when thunderstorms appear imminent or when the cloud ceiling is so low that the astronauts would have trouble steering back to an emergency landing.</p>
        <p>With any break in the weather, the seven-member crew will ride Atlantis into an 184-mile-high orbit. The instruments for studying the chemistry and physics of the atmosphere are housed in a laboratory in the shuttle cargo bay.</p>
        <p>The flight of this laboratory, called Atlas, for Atmosphere Laboratory for Applications and Science, will be the first of a series of similar surveys over the next decade.</p>
        <p>Many of the observations could be critical in setting policy on such environmental issues as the potential for global warming and the depletion of the protective ozone layer, both the consequences of human-induced changes in the upper atmosphere.</p>
