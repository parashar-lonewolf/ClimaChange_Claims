        <p>LEAD: President Bush today endorsed a proposal that the use of industrial chemicals that deplete the earth's protective ozone shield be eliminated by the year 2000.</p>
        <p>President Bush today endorsed a proposal that the use of industrial chemicals that deplete the earth's protective ozone shield be eliminated by the year 2000.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush announced his decision a day after the 12 European Community countries unexpectedly vowed to ban production and use of the chemicals, chlorofluorocarbons, by the end of the century.</p>
        <p>Administration officials said the United States would seek worldwide elimination of the chemicals through the strengthening of an existing treaty, which calls for cutting by 50 percent the production and use of the chemicals by the year 2000. #75% of World Production Together the United States and the European Community account for more than 75 percent of world production of chlorofluorocarbons, the most pervasive of several chemicals that many scientists now believe are depleting ozone in the upper atmosphere.</p>
        <p>Scientists have warned that as the ozone layer gets thinner, more ultraviolet radiation from the sun will penetrate to the earth's surface. This would cause more cases of skin cancer, cataracts and other health problems among humans, as well as damage to wildlife and crops.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush said in a talk at the National Academy of Sciences today that his support for the elimination of the chlorofluorocarbons, which are used by industry in refrigerants, foams, solvents and a wide range of other applications, is contingent upon the development of adequate substitutes.</p>
        <p>But William K. Reilly, Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, said industry leaders had assured him that substititutes would be available in time for a complete phaseout of the chemicals over the next decade.</p>
        <p>In addition to chlorofluorocarbons, the President is supporting the elimination of halons, chemicals used in fire extinguishers, which also destroy ozone in the atmosphere, he reported.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reilly left this evening for London to take part in a 112-nation meeting called by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to discuss the next steps in protecting the ozone layer.</p>
        <p>Under a treaty signed in Montreal in 1987, which went into effect at the end of the year, use and production of chlorofluorocarbons are frozen at 1986 levels starting this year and are to be reduced by 50 percent worldwide by the end of the century. Hole in Ozone Layer</p>
        <p>But emerging scientific data, including reports of a gaping hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica and the probability of similar losses in the Arctic region, have indicated that such a reduction would be inadequate. Without a complete phaseout, the chemicals would continue to accumulate in the atmosphere and destroy ozone molecules for another century, scientists say.</p>
        <p>The parties to the treaty plan to determine in 1990 whether further measures are needed to protect the ozone shield. But in a telephone interview today, Mr. Reilly said that because of the gravity with which the problem is viewed, international action to eliminate the chemicals was possible this year.</p>
        <p>He said Mr. Bush's support of a complete ban on the chemicals demonstrated that ''the United States is continuing to maintain the leadership position on this issue that we held ever since we phased out aerosols using CFC's in the 1970's.''</p>
        <p>He also said that to encourage wide participation by other countries, particularly the developing countries, in getting rid of the chemicals, the United States would share its knowledge about substitutes as well as ''share our sense of urgency.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Reilly had strongly urged Mr. Bush to support the elimination of the chemicals. His predecessor at the environmental agency, Lee M. Thomas, called for a ban on the chemicals last September. Urgency Is Stressed</p>
        <p>Irving M. Mintzer, a senior associate of the World Resources Institute, a Washington-based research and policy group, said today that it was crucial to provide information on substitutes and the technology to use them to developing countries. Dr. Mintzer is one of the American members of an international panel that will meet in Brussels next week to assess the economic effects of ending the use of the chemicals.</p>
        <p>He noted that under the existing treaty, developing countries, that now use very little of the chemicals, are allowed to increase their production and consumption of the chemicals as part of their industrialization projects. But if countries like China, India, Indonesia and Brazil increase use of chlorofluorocarbons as much as permitted by the treaty, he said, the chemicals would continue to accumulate in the atmosphere even if the industrial countries barred them completely.</p>
        <p>Signers of the ozone treaty plan to meet in Helsinki in June to review new information and to decide the next steps to take in meeting the threat.</p>
        <p>If a decision is reached to take stronger action to eliminate the threat to the ozone shield, no additional approval by Congress is needed as the treaty is written, a State Department spokesman said.</p>
        <p>Senators Al Gore, Democrat of Tennessee, and John H. Chafee, Republican of Rhode Island, called Mr. Bush's decision an important step forward said the chemicals should be eliminated well before the end of the century.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore has introduced legislation that would require the United States to end all production and use of chlorofluorocarbons within five years and would ban imports of the chemical and products that use them. ''Each additional year we continue putting these poisons in the environment means an extra 10 years required to remove them,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chafee, who has also introduced a bill to require a halt in use of the chemicals, said, ''No time is too soon to end CFC production and use.''</p>
