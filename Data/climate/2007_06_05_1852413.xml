        <p>Officials with the Adirondack Council, an environmental group, are lobbying to reverse planned reductions in the federal budget that would severely limit or eliminate several acid rain monitoring programs. The proposed budget would cut $1 million, about 25 percent, from one program that measures atmospheric gases. Two other programs that sample lakes and streams in the Adirondacks and other areas of the Northeast on an annual combined budget of less than $1 million would also be eliminated. Acid rain remains a serious problem in many parts of the country, but nowhere has it been more damaging than in the Adirondacks, where vast forests have been decimated and more than 500 lakes and ponds have been left unable to support many species of native fish. ''Closing down, even for a few months, will wipe out 21 years of continuously collected scientific data,'' Brian L. Houseal, the council's executive director, said in a statement.</p>
