        <p>The remains of a prehistoric hunting lookout in Northern Alaska have been identified as the earliest well-documented evidence of people living in America, archeologists announced today.</p>
        <p>The discovery of some finely worked stone lance points and charcoal from campfires at the 11,700-year-old site appeared to solve one mystery of the earliest Americans: If they had indeed migrated across land then connecting Siberia and Alaska, where were the remains of this paleo-Indian culture in the Far North?</p>
        <p>Previously, the earliest established artifacts were those found in the high plains and Southwest of the United States, dating from about 11,000 years ago.</p>
        <p>But recent research raised more questions about where these Alaskan people originally came from. The new evidence, combined with findings elsewhere in Alaska, seems to indicate that in the same epoch two distinctive cultures existed here, having migrated across the Bering Land Bridge that linked the two continents in the last ice age, ending about 10,000 years ago. 'Much Speculation' Predicted</p>
        <p>One culture was that of the paleo-Indians, whose artifacts closely resemble the tools and weapons of the people to the south who lived from 11,000 years ago to about 8,500 years ago but are not in the least similar to any known Asian people of that time. The other culture was that of the 11,000-year-old Nenana Complex of central Alaska, whose materials are quite similar to those of the Siberians of that period.</p>
        <p>Michael Kunz, an archeologist with the Department of Interior's Bureau of Land Management who made the campsite discovery 15 years ago, said, "Since there is no evidence in Siberia for paleo-Indian ancestors, there will be much speculation as to the place of origin of this culture."</p>
        <p>Archeologists said the discovery of these paleo-Indian artifacts in Alaska was an exciting and important event in New World archeology, not only for what it reveals but because it is certain to force scholars to rethink many of their theories about how and when people first entered the Americas.</p>
        <p>The findings do not, however, challenge the widely accepted view that the migration, or migrations, occurred across the land known as Beringia, a broad plain between Siberia and Alaska that was exposed when sea levels plummeted during the last ice age.</p>
        <p>Nor will the research settle any of the several controversies raging around the dating of other early American sites. Scientists have reported signs of human occupation of Meadowcroft, a Pennsylvania site south of Pittsburgh, some 19,000 years ago; in Clovis, N.M., 11,000 years ago; in Monte Verde, Chile, 13,000 years ago, and in Pedra Furada, Brazil, more than 30,000 years ago. But these claims have not been generally accepted by scientists because of concerns over the dating techniques. Research Is Praised</p>
        <p>Dr. Robert L. Humphrey, an anthropologist at George Washington University and specialist in paleo-Indian culture, praised the latest research, saying that the dating of the artifacts appeared to have been carefully done and accurate. He said he was "pretty excited when I saw the collection" of lance points, which he said "seems to be paleo-Indian in every respect."</p>
        <p>The announcement was made at a news conference here by Mr. Kunz and Dr. Richard Reanier, a professor of anthropology at the University of Washington in Seattle. A report will be delivered next month at a meeting of the Society of American Archeology in St. Louis.</p>
        <p>"It was dumb luck," Mr. Kunz said of his discovery of the site in 1978. While surveying the region in advance of planned oil exploration, he came across some stone projectile points scattered on the ground. They had probably been used with lance-like "throwing sticks." He and others returned to the site many times, collecting more artifacts and charcoal bits for radiocarbon dating analysis and carefully analyzing the potentially controversial findings.</p>
        <p>The site is atop a 200-foot-high mesa near the northern slopes of the Brooks Range, a few hundred miles inland from the western coast of Alaska, and 200 miles south of Point Barrow. The Bureau of Land Management has taken steps to protect the mesa and surrounding land from any development and to nominate it to the National Register of Historic Places. What the View Was</p>
        <p>To stand on the mesa, the archeologists said, was to understand what people were doing there. It provides a 360-degree view of the plains, making it ideal for scouting out herds of bison and the now-extinct mammoth. All the stone tools and lance points found at the lookout are related to hunting.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kunz said all the stone points were stylistically the same, similar to the Clovis and Folsom points associated with the paleo-Indians of the American Southwest. But radiocarbon dating done in the late 1970's showed the points to be about 7,620 years -- old and paleo-Indian, but nothing close to the beginnings of human habitation in the New World.</p>
        <p>By 1989, however, a new and more precise radiocarbon dating technique had been perfected, involving accelerator/atomic mass spectrometers. Eleven charcoal samples analyzed by this instrument showed that the Mesa site, as it is being called, was used by people from 9,700 to 11,700 years ago. The earlier date suggested that these Mesa people could have been ancestors of the paleo-Indians found in the mid-continental latitudes.</p>
        <p>In an interview, Mr. Kunz said: "This really rocked us back on our heels. Now we had paleo-Indian stuff and it was older than the oldest paleo-Indian stuff in the Lower 48."</p>
        <p>Only then, after consulting with other experts on paleo-Indians, did the two archeologists feel sure enough of the dates to report their results. The Next Objective</p>
        <p>The next objective, Dr. Reanier said, would be to search the surrounding terrain for traces of the base camp these people may have occupied and also for their "kill sites," where animals might have been ambushed and slaughtered. No animal bones were found at the Mesa site, nor were any materials showing how the people might have lived.</p>
        <p>In his analysis, Mr. Kunz emphasized that the findings appeared to "complicate if not contradict" some theories about the peopling of America because of the finding of two different cultures dating from the same time. It is not clear, he and other archeologists said, whether the paleo-Indians evolved their technology once they got to Alaska or perhaps on the long, slow migration across the land bridge.</p>
        <p>Dr. Humphrey said in an interview that the land bridge was hundreds of miles wide and lasted thousands of years. "I would imagine there were hundreds of small parties of hunters and gatherers over long periods of time who wandered over that bridge," he said. They had left Asia and did not even know it.</p>
        <p>If they had developed the tool and weapon technology in Asia, where are the relics in Siberia? Even if the technology was American-born, Dr. Reanier said, it would seem strange that some of it was not carried back to the Old World, since it is assumed that traffic over the land bridge went both ways. Mr. Kunz raised the possibility that the people known as paleo-Indians could have originated elsewhere in Asia and merely passed through Siberia without leaving clear traces.</p>
        <p>In any event, archeologists said the discovery showed the importance of conducting even more thorough explorations of Siberia. Dr. Sergei Slobodin, a Russian archeologist who has excavated Siberian sites, worked with Mr. Kunz and Dr. Reanier in analyzing the Mesa site and artifacts.</p>
        <p>Other research in recent years has also pointed to a more complicated picture of the earliest Americas. Many much earlier, though controversial, sites are being uncovered. Linguistic analysis and studies of early American teeth, compared with Asian teeth, have led scientists to speculate that there could have been at least three waves of migration.</p>
        <p>Correction:  March 26, 1993, Friday</p>
        <p>A map yesterday showing possible migration routes of ancient peoples into the Americas gave outdated estimates of the ages of some archeological sites in some editions and misstated the scientific acceptance of some estimates in other editions. The Meadowcroft site, near Pittsburgh, has been estimated at 19,000 years old; the Pedra Furada site, in Brazil, more than 30,000, and the site in Monte Verde, Chile, 13,000. The estimates have not been generally accepted; there is wider agreement about the dates of other sites.</p>
