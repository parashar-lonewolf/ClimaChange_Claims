        <p>LEAD: After agreeing on the difficult issue of how to curb acid rain, the House Energy and Commerce Committee voted tonight to recommend sweeping legislation to strengthen the Clean Air Act. The vote was 42 to 1.</p>
        <p>After agreeing on the difficult issue of how to curb acid rain, the House Energy and Commerce Committee voted tonight to recommend sweeping legislation to strengthen the Clean Air Act. The vote was 42 to 1.</p>
        <p>The measure includes a complex allowance system intended to help Midwestern states with the added burden of reducing pollutants that cause acid rain.</p>
        <p>Like the bill passed by the Senate on Tuesday, the House bill would provide the Federal Government and state and local governments with new tools to reduce urban smog and toxic chemicals in the air, as well as the acid rain that is harming lakes and streams in some parts of this country and Canada.</p>
        <p>But there are some significant differences in the two bills that will need to be resolved in a conference between members of the House and Senate before a bill can be sent to the President. Many of those differences have to do with tougher requirements in the House bill to reduce urban smog.</p>
        <p>As the House committee neared completion of its bill, the Environmental Protection Agency today released its annual report on urban air quality trends, showing that urban smog had increased by 2 percent from 1979 through 1988.</p>
        <p>Lead Concentrations Decline</p>
        <p>The report showed that other air pollutants listed by the Clean Air Act, including sulfur, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides and dust, had declined but were still present in urban areas at relatively high levels. Only lead concentrations in the air dropped sharply in the period, largely because lead in gasoline is being gradually eliminated, the report found.</p>
        <p>William K. Reilly, Administrator of the E.P.A., said when releasing the report, ''Reauthorizing the Clean Air Act, a top priority of President Bush, is the best way to improve the air Americans breathe without hindering the country's economic growth.''</p>
        <p>Like the Senate bill, the legislation drafted by the House committee would set new deadlines for meeting smog requirements and would also require annual progress in reducing smog, a requirement that is not in the current law. The new measure would require stricter controls on pollution from automobile emissions starting in the mid-1990's and, if the environmental agency decides it is necessary, even tighter controls after the turn of the century.</p>
        <p>The House bill, like the Senate's, would require factories and other sources of toxic pollution to install the ''maximum available control technology'' to reduce such pollution. It would also have a second stage of controls on air toxics that would be contingent on earlier progress.</p>
        <p>A Question of Who Pays</p>
        <p>Also like the Senate bill, the House measure would require that sulfur dioxide emissions from coal-burning power plants, the chief component of acid rain, be reduced by 10 million tons, to about 50 percent of the current amount, by the end of the century.</p>
        <p>At issue in the House panel's debate over acid rain was not how or how much sulfur dioxide should be cut, but who should bear the economic burden of curbing pollution.</p>
        <p>Lawmakers from Midwestern states, where most of the power plants are situated, had asked that the cost of reducing pollution be shared nationally. Representative Philip R. Sharp, an Indiana Democrat, wanted an amendment that would have required a fee on sulfur pollution from factories, refineries and other sources other than power plants, to help the electric utilities and their customers meet the cost of reducing acid rain.</p>
        <p>Aid for Coal Miners</p>
        <p>Lawmakers from coal-mining states hoped for financial aid for miners of high sulfur coal, whose jobs would be threatened if utilities were forced to switch to cleaner low-sulfur coal.</p>
        <p>But the committee did not adopt either form of aid. Instead, it concentrated on distributing credits that would be awarded to utilities that lower their emissions more than required by the law. These credits could be bought, sold or traded. Plants that lower their emissions below the required level could presumably sell their credits to help pay for the costs of scrubbers or low-sulfur coal.</p>
        <p>Representative Terry L. Bruce, Democrat of Illinois, said: ''This acid rain accord is better for the Midwest than the Senate bill. It softens the blow against the Midwest.''</p>
        <p>Because the House committee sought to resolve the sharp regional differences in negotiations, a protracted debate on the floor of the House is not expected, aides said tonight. The legislation will probably be taken up by the House within the next few weeks, the aides said.</p>
