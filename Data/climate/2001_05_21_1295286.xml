        <p>United States Senator Joseph I. Lieberman told some 500 new graduates of Trinity College today that he had come as ''a recruiter,'' and that he hoped to persuade at least a few of them to consider, as he did during his college years, a career in public service.</p>
        <p>The senator's 20-minute speech was laced with quotations from John F. Kennedy and Benjamin Franklin on the honor of working for the public good. Only once did Mr. Lieberman, a Democrat who came within several hundred votes of becoming vice president in last November's presidential election, say anything remotely political: he subtly criticized the Bush administration's emphasis on more fossil fuel production as part of the solution to the current energy crisis.</p>

        <p>United States Senator Joseph I. Lieberman told some 500 new graduates of Trinity College today that he had come as ''a recruiter,'' and that he hoped to persuade at least a few of them to consider, as he did during his college years, a career in public service.</p>
        <p>The senator's 20-minute speech was laced with quotations from John F. Kennedy and Benjamin Franklin on the honor of working for the public good. Only once did Mr. Lieberman, a Democrat who came within several hundred votes of becoming vice president in last November's presidential election, say anything remotely political: he subtly criticized the Bush administration's emphasis on more fossil fuel production as part of the solution to the current energy crisis.</p>
        <p>''We need your vision to confront the very real threat of global warming,'' he said. ''And we need your brilliance and innovation to shape our energy future into one that is based on a new, clean and efficient technologies, not on old fuels that pollute our world's atmosphere and diminish our nation's independence.''</p>
        <p>Describing public service as a noble profession, Mr. Lieberman told the graduates, ''Dream of being mayor, or governor or senator or vice president or president, regardless of your faith, your race, your gender, your nationality, your sexual orientation.''</p>
        <p>Among those also receiving honorary degrees were Daniel K. Inouye, a United States senator from Hawaii; the Cable News Network's founder, Ted Turner; and Evan S. Dobelle, Trinity's departing president, who is taking over as president of the University of Hawaii.</p>
