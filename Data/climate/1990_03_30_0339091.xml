        <p>LEAD: The Newmont Mining Corporation announced yesterday that it would sell its controlling interest in the nation's largest coal company to Newmont's largest shareholder, London-based Hanson P.L.C.</p>
        <p>The Newmont Mining Corporation announced yesterday that it would sell its controlling interest in the nation's largest coal company to Newmont's largest shareholder, London-based Hanson P.L.C.</p>
        <p>The $715 million deal for a 54.97 percent stake in Peabody Holding Company Inc. is another step in Hanson's rapid transformation into one of the largest international mining companies.</p>
        <p>Last month, Hanson agreed to pay $504 million to three American companies for the 45.03 percent of Peabody that Newmont did not own. Last August, Hanson paid $5.5 billion for Consolidated Gold Fields, which owns 49.3 percent of Newmont as well as stakes in two other large gold producers.</p>
        <p>For Newmont, the Peabody transaction concludes a two-year campaign of asset sales to focus on gold production and reduce a $1.9 billion debt incurred in fighting off a 1987 takeover attempt by T. Boone Pickens. The sale follows an unsuccessful attempt last year by Newmont to buy the three minority stakes in Peabody and then resell half the company to investment banks while keeping a dividend of $425 million to pay off debts.</p>
        <p>The deal with the three companies for the 45 percent interest in Peabody, is scheduled to close next month and the purchase of the Newmont stake in the coal company is planned for June, Hanson said.</p>
        <p>As part of the Newmont agreement with Hanson, the two companies are committed to accepting an offer of at least $1.24 billion for all of Peabody, provided the offer came before the closing of both deals. Newmont sought this arrangement to allow other bidders to submit larger offers.</p>
        <p>The holders of the 45 percent stake are the Boeing Company, Bechtel Investments Inc. and Eastern Enterprises. Their deal values Peabody at 14 percent less than the Newmont deal.</p>
        <p>The difference means that Newmont will receive a $100 million premium. Hanson will pay a premium because it is getting control of Peabody, said David H. Clarke, the president of Hanson Industries, which is the United States arm of Hanson P.L.C. and will make the actual acquisition.</p>
        <p>Price Surprises Wall Street</p>
        <p>The high price surprised Wall Street. Newmont's stock leaped $2.50 yesterday to close at $47.875 on the New York Stock Exchange, while American depository receipts of Hanson closed at $18.875, up 12.5 cents on the Big Board. The Standard and Poor's Corporation reacted by announcing that it would consider upgrading its BBB-minus rating of $77 million of Newmont's senior debt.</p>
        <p>''Seven hundred and fifteen million dollars is above my expectation,'' said Vahid Fathi, a mining analyst for Prescott, Ball &amp; Turben, a Cleveland brokerage. ''The coal business is not something they're going to write home about.''</p>
        <p>Hanson's Mr. Clarke said Peabody's earnings, management and recent development of low-sulfur coal deposits in Montana justified the price. Low-sulfur coal is increasingly popular with electric utilities because it produces less acid rain.</p>
        <p>Peabody earned pretax profits of $136.5 million on sales of $1.74 billion last year.</p>
        <p>Peabody recently concluded a new contract with its miners after a long and bitter strike. Mr. Clarke said he was ''not overly concerned about the labor situation.''</p>
        <p>Hanson expects energy prices to rise in the 1990's, Mr. Clarke said. Any overpayment for Peabody also benefits Hanson indirectly, because of its large stake in Newmont, he added.</p>
        <p>Newmont said it expected to receive $600 million in cash from the transaction after taxes and expenses. The company will use the proceeds to pay off almost all outstanding debt except a $540 million low-interest loan that requires quarterly repayments in gold, said James F. Hill, a spokesman for the company.</p>
