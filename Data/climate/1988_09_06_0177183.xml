        <p>LEAD: A MAJOR new round of probes to the inner and outer reaches of the solar system could yield important clues about how life began on Earth, say scientists who study the mystery of life's origins.</p>
        <p>A MAJOR new round of probes to the inner and outer reaches of the solar system could yield important clues about how life began on Earth, say scientists who study the mystery of life's origins.</p>
        <p>Space flights planned or proposed for the coming decade will allow the scientists to study comets, planets, moons and other cosmic destinations for evidence of the transition of chemicals from inanimate matter to living things.</p>
        <p>The far-flung search will be guided by a new theory that holds that life was the almost inevitable outcome of ''chemical evolution'' following the formation of the solar system. The theory has been driven by new evidence, most recently from the spacecraft that flew near Halley's Comet, that the universe is awash with the chemical precursors of life.</p>
        <p>''There is astonishing potential that clues to the origin of life will be found elsewhere in the solar system and in other stars and galaxies,'' said Lynn Griffiths, chief of the life sciences division of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in Washington. ''Everywhere we look, we find biologically important processes and substances.''</p>
        <p>While the main goal of the studies is to learn more about the process by which chemicals became organized into ever more complex forms, the latest findings have also revived hopes that signs of primitive life, possibly extinct, might be found on Mars.</p>
        <p>The current theory suggests that, some four billion years ago, huge amounts of the elements essential to life and perhaps also such complex organic molecules as amino acids were showered onto Earth and other planets by comets, meteorites and interstellar dust.</p>
        <p>''Organic synthesis is going on everywhere, in the atmosphere of planets, on the surface of Pluto, and between the stars,'' said Dale Cruikshank, an astronomer at the NASA-Ames Research Center in Mountain View, Calif. ''The universe is full of organic chemistry. However life originated on Earth, this stuff has been raining on us for time immemorial.''</p>
        <p>Fossil evidence indicates that bacteria appeared on Earth about 3.5 billion years ago, only one billion years after the solar system formed. The great challenge is to learn how, within that first billion years, simple organic chemicals evolved into more complex ones, then into the proteins, genetic material and living, reproducing cells.</p>
        <p>No record is believed to exist of chemical evolution in the Earth's first billon years. But scientists think they can find clues elsewhere in the solar system, where similar evolution may have occured in the past, or where such changes may now be brewing. Good places to look, the scientists say, include inside comets and asteroids, under frozen Martian lakebeds, deep inside the smoggy atmosphere of Saturn's moon Titan and beneath the smooth frozen surface of Jupiter's moon Europa.</p>
        <p>The advances in theory about life's origins are coming just as the country is poised for new interplanetary exploration. ''The climate is good for solar system exploration,'' said Glenn Carle, chief of the solar system exploration branch at the Ames center. ''It seems the queen has given us new ships.''</p>
        <p>While research on the origins of life is not the main goal of the missions, the prospect of important new data is already generating excitement among the band of scientists around the country who are devoted to this problem. Watched from Sidelines</p>
        <p>It has been 10 years since the United States launched a spacecraft to another part of the solar system -the Pioneer mission to Venus. American scientists watched from the sidelines while other nations flew spacecraft past Halley's Comet in l986, missions that found the comet to be carrying far more organic matter than expected.</p>
        <p>But planetary scientists are optimistic that next year will mark the beginning of the second great phase of solar system exploration. Two spacecraft, Magellan and Galileo, are scheduled to be launched on spring and fall space shuttle flights to Venus and Jupiter respectively. The flights have been delayed several times because of problems with the space shuttle.</p>
        <p>Thereafter, most planetary spacecraft will be launched using expendable rockets, said Dr. Geoffrey Briggs, director of NASA's solar system exploration division, thus avoiding the shuttle delays that can hamper precisely timed planetary missions.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the Voyager spacecraft will reach Neptune next August.</p>
        <p>An orbiting mission to Mars is planned for launching in l992, Dr. Briggs said, and a new spacecraft is on the drawing boards to be launched in l995. Plans call for the craft to rendezvous with a comet in the year 2000, to send a probe into its core and to fly along side the comet for three years as it whips around the Sun. An almost identical spacecraft with different instruments might be launched in l996 for a four-year stay around Saturn and its moons. It would send a probe into the atmosphere of the moon Titan. Ventures With Soviet Union</p>
        <p>NASA is also discussing possible ventures with the Soviet Union for further exploration of Mars, Dr. Briggs said. Soviet officials have said that studies relevant to life origins will be included in their Mars missions.</p>
        <p>Some scientists are becoming increasingly optimistic that signs of extraterrestrial life will be discovered, said Mr. Carle, who organized a recent symposium on biological questions to be posed on future missions into deep space. Although the l976 Viking mission to Mars found no evidence of life, he said new ideas and observations about the chemical history of planets and stars are fueling the current optimism.</p>
        <p>One observation is that vast dust clouds floating between stars contain many of the precursor organic molecules that can, under the right conditions, be transformed into the building blocks of proteins, genetic material and cell membranes. When the clouds collapse to form new stars and planets, it is theorized, some of these generally lightweight and fragile precursors are preserved in comets and in the atmospheres of outer planets.</p>
        <p>The inner planets get so hot that the molecules are blown apart into their constituent atoms. Thereafter, the lighter elements that are critical to life as we know it - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous and sulfur - are blown toward the outer planets. 'The Earth Was Bald'</p>
        <p>No one knows what the Earth's early atmosphere was like, said Dr. Harold Klein, an expert in cosmological evolution at the University of Santa Clara. And they never will, he said, becuse not long after the planets finished taking shape the Sun, like many newly formed stars, emitted an intense burst of solar wind that literally knocked the atmospheres, if indeed there were any, off Mercury, Venus, the Earth and Mars.</p>
        <p>''The Earth was bald,'' Dr. Klein said. ''The paradox has been, where did our atmosphere come from?''</p>
        <p>The increasingly seductive answer, he said, is comets, meteorites and dust, contain all those lighter elements critical to life. In fact, comets seem to be 40 percent water, 40 percent fine sand and 20 percent these vital chemicals, sometimes joined into complex organic molecules, like formaldehyde, which are also found in interplanetary and interstellar dust.</p>
        <p>Recently, when Halley's Comet neared the Sun and produced its enormous tail, scientists found that it lost an astonishing 200,000 pounds of material per second, presumably including plenty of the the vital chemicals, some of which will eventually ''rain'' onto planets. Soon after the solar system formed, after the solar wind died down to normal velocities, scientists believe that the solar system was bombarded by comets and meteorites for more than a half-billion years years.</p>
        <p>Although most arriving comets would be blown apart on impact, and complex molecules would again be blasted apart, many scientists now theorize that the atomic building blocks for Earth's air, water and living creatures arrived via comets. It is also possible that more complex molecules, like amino acids and nucleic acid bases, might have occasionally survived the crash. Paths of Chemical Evolution</p>
        <p>The evidence for such a bombardment remains scattered throughout the solar system - in the craters of Mercury and the Moon, in the asteroid belt, in the large amounts of water and impact craters observed on moons around the giant outer planets and in a steady rain of dust particles from space.</p>
        <p>Once the bombardment of comets and meteorites stopped, scientists say, each planet followed a different path of chemical evolution. For reasons not yet fully understood, however, only Earth followed a path that eventually led to primitive life followed by higher life forms.</p>
        <p>Again according to the theory, this chemical miracle happened amazingly fast if, as most scientists believe, the solar system is 4.5 billion years old. The oldest fossils on Earth are 3.5 billion year old bacterial mats called stromatolites.</p>
        <p>This means that life arose and took form on Earth within about half a billion years, Dr. Klein said, between the end of the heaviest bombardment and the appearance of stromatolites. It also means that some form of early primitive life may also have developed on Earth's closest neighbors. Early conditions on Venus, Earth and Mars were probably very similar and very conducive to life, Dr. Klein said.</p>
        <p>The outer planets followed a different chemical path. Jupiter and Saturn are gas giants whose turbulent atmospheres, while filled with the vital chemicals of life, are almost certainly inhospitable to life. Some of their moons, however, retain atmospheres rich in organic material and water. Uranus and Neptune appear to have methane-rich stratospheres with frozen moons containing hydrocarbons and at least one moon with an atmosphere. Questions to Be Answered</p>
        <p>Given this model of how the solar system formed and has been flooded with organic molecules, space scientists want to take a secod, closer look at all the bodies in the system. Following are some of the topics they hope to learn more about from each destination:</p>
        <p>Comets: What organic materials are present in comets? To what extent, and how, has this material been synthesized into complex, biologically interesting molecules? Is there any evidence that substantial amounts of material from comets has been delivered to the planets?</p>
        <p>Asteroids: Do they have large amounts of organic molecules? How much water do they contain? How many are burned-out comets?</p>
        <p>Mercury: How old are the craters, and what can they tell us about the heavy bombardment early in solar system history?</p>
        <p>Venus: Is there evidence that the planet had an early ocean? Because Venus is closer to the Sun and hotter than Earth, scientists think the planet lost its water over about 100 million years and then experienced a runaway greenhouse effect. Early chemical processes leading to life would have been nipped in the bud.</p>
        <p>Moon: How old are impact craters? What are meteorites on the surface like?. Does the record of early bombardment exist on the Moon? Did later impacts occur in any particular pattern, or are they random?</p>
        <p>Mars: Because it was once so much like early Earth and had abundant amounts of water, Mars might have produced primitive life. It is not known how Mars lost most of its atmosphere, although one theory holds that asteroids literally knocked it loose. In any case, fossils of early life forms, not unlike those that developed during those unrecorded half-billion years on Earth, could lie beneath frozen lake beds on Mars. According to Dr. Chris McKay at the Ames center, it is also remotely possible that life could exist on Mars if there is water in hidden niches. Life is very tenacious once it takes hold, Dr. McKay said. Moreover, scientists have determined that turtles and cockroaches can survive in jars that simulate Martian conditions.</p>
        <p>Europa: Does this Jovian moon have a liquid ocean beneath its smooth icy surface? Are there internal sources of energy that would promote life? Can cell membranes form in such cold temperatures?</p>
        <p>Titan: This moon of Saturn has a thick, smoggy atmosphere. What kind of prebiotic chemistry is taking place in its lower reaches? Do these processes give clues as to how precursor molecules led to life on Earth?</p>
        <p>While the search for the origins of life is not the primary focus of planetary exploration, answers will be forthcoming as space scientists study basic physical and chemical processes in the solar system, said Dr. Lew Allen, director of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.</p>
        <p>Because the universe is full of organic molecules that can lead to life, some scientists think that life must be the rule rather than the exception. But, Dr. Allen said, it remains to be settled whether Earth is ''a common thing or an extraordinary accident.''  Flights throughout the solar system will look for signs of ''chemical evolution,'' changes in carbon-containing organic chemicals like those that gave rise to life on earth.  A Shower of Life's Building Blocks  Driving the new search for clues to life's beginnings is the recent discovery that comets, meteors and interstellar dust carry vast amounts of complex organic chemicals as well as the elements crucial to living cells. Scientists believe that Earth and other planets have been seeded from space with these potential building blocks of life. Cometary dust collected on Earth, below, is rich in organic material.  Comets and Asteroids  Scientists hope to learn more about the presence and complexity of organic molecules on these bodies.  The Inner Planets  Craters on Mercury may reveal the history of meteorite bombardment. Venus might once have had an ocean in which organic chemical evolution took place. Formerly more similar to Earth, Mars might contain fossils of primitive life.  Jupiter  Is there a life-promoting liquid ocean beneath the icy surface of the Jovian moon Europa?  Saturn  The atmosphere of the moon Titan is a cauldron of organic chemistry that may duplicate the early steps in the evolution of life on Earth.</p>
