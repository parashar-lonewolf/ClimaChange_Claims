        <p>Three United States Department of Agriculture scientists, Dr. Hyrum Johnson, Dr. Herman Mayeux and Dr. Wayne Polley, are studying how different levels of carbon dioxide affect the growth and water use of native plants.

        <p>ECOLOGISTS studying the prairie suggest that higher levels of carbon dioxide could change the vegetative face of America, benefiting woody plants at the expense of grasslands.</p>
        <p>Three United States Department of Agriculture scientists, Dr. Hyrum Johnson, Dr. Herman Mayeux and Dr. Wayne Polley, are studying how different levels of carbon dioxide affect the growth and water use of native plants. The plants are monitored in a 128-foot chamber at the Grassland, Soil and Water Research Laboratory in Temple, Tex., as the carbon dioxide content gradually decreases from 350 parts per million, the current atmospheric concentration, to as little as a 150 parts.</p>
        <p>"We're trying to figure out what greater levels of carbon dioxide might mean for plants, by asking what happened in the past," Dr. Johnson said in a telephone interview. He said other researchers were studying the effects of higher levels of carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>The atmospheric concentration has risen about 30 percent since the 1850's, largely as a result of burning fossil fuels and cutting down forests. Levels are expected to continue rising as the population expands.</p>
        <p>In general, carbon dioxide has a fertilizing effect and lets plants grow on less water, the scientists have found, but some plants flourish more than others. This could change the appearance of the range, Dr. Johnson said, but he cautions that many factors affect plants, including water, temperature and insects.</p>
        <p>"The biodynamics that determine the composition of vegetation are complex and interrelated," he said. "Carbon dioxide is just one factor, but one we feel is very important to understand."</p>
        <p>The scientists are finding that most crops and woody brush plants, like mesquite, grow bigger and faster than warm-season forage grasses in higher carbon dioxide concentrations.</p>
        <p>"If carbon dioxide levels rise as predicted, we could see a shifting of boundaries," Dr. Johnson said, "with the forest moving toward the prairie and the prairie edging out the desert."</p>
        <p>Parts of Texas have already seen a brush invasion, with an increase of about 20 million acres of brush in the last decade, Dr. Johnson said. This may be unwelcome news to cattle ranchers, but the scientists note that the possibility of increased plant production and water efficiency could present new opportunities. Goats, apparently, like munching on mesquite.</p>
