        <p>Gianfranco Fini</p>
      </block>
      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Gianfranco Fini</p>
        <p>STANDING IN HIS SPACIOUS OFFICE NEAR ROME'S SPANISH Steps, Gianfranco Fini reaches for a bit of Americana. From a bookshelf that once held his infamous collection of Mussolini's greatest works, he takes down a somewhat lighter read  -- a biography of New York's Republican Senator, Alfonse M. D'Amato, personally  inscribed, "To Gianfranco, Good luck."</p>
        <p>Fini turns the book over in his hands, repeating the Senator's best wishes, quietly emphasizing his tiny but growing credibility outside Italy. "I have been defined in the Italian press as the Italian Gingrich," he says proudly, taking what is for an extreme right-winger a surprisingly pro-American stance. "It's a  great country."</p>
        <p>Once dubbed the heir to Benito Mussolini, Fini claims he has shed his Fascist skin, transforming himself into Italy's favorite politician and a sought-after dinner guest. He is at pains to point out that he even received an  invitation from the Israeli Embassy to attend a memorial concert for the slain Prime Minister, Yitzhak Rabin. "Everything has changed," he says.</p>
        <p>So he claims. Nonetheless, the suspicion remains that his reincarnation as a  "post-Fascist" is just an airbrush job to reassure moderates as he gets closer to real power. The same holds for his party, the increasingly influential National Alliance.</p>
        <p>Just a day before the concert for Rabin, for instance, Italy's newspapers were filled with pictures of a high-ranking Alliance official making a Fascist salute at a wedding party. A year or so earlier another official suggested that  homosexuals be put in concentration camps. And one Alliance member punched a Green Party member on the floor of the Chamber of Deputies, touching off a brawl.</p>
        <p>Fini, it seems, has trouble controlling his troops -- a motley assortment of  Mussolini fanatics, neo-Fascists and run-of-the-mill conservatives: the troops haven't necessarily undergone the same transformation as their leader. Even so,  Fini becomes irritated when anyone questions his, or his followers', sincerity.  "It makes me angry when people think we are pretending."</p>
        <p>Fini, 44, joined the neo-Fascist Italian Social Movement when he was 17, outraged by a Communist demonstration that had prevented him from seeing a John  Wayne movie, "The Green Berets." After working briefly as a journalist, he was elected to Parliament in 1983 under the Movement's banner and consolidated his control of the party in 1991. Last year he renamed it the National Alliance in an attempt to distance himself from both his own and his party's past shenanigans.</p>
        <p>The image makeover, which will be tested in today's national elections, seems to be working. Many, perhaps most, Italians have forgot Fini's black-shirt tactics, his nationalistic rallies, the skinhead groupies following him around chanting "Duce, Duce, Duce" and his notorious comment two years ago that Mussolini was "the greatest statesman of the 20th century." Indeed, an astounding 61 percent have rated him Italy's best politician, though far fewer -- about 20 percent -- said they would actually vote for an Alliance candidate.</p>
        <p>"I am happy that the Italians think I have changed the face of the Italian right," he says. "I hope to show that this is not a momentary thing connected to my personality but a definitive kind of change."</p>
        <p>Like many of Europe's new hard-right politicians, Fini has profited from a plethora of problems dragging down Italy's political establishment, including high unemployment, increasing crime and a Roman-size wave of government corruption that has washed away two former Prime Ministers and scores of other officials.</p>
        <p>And Fini got a boost from Silvio Berlusconi, the media mogul turned politico  who caused an international stir two years ago when he included Fini and other Fascists in his short-lived coalition Government. The National Alliance was rewarded for its loyalty with five ministerial positions.</p>
        <p>Much has been written in the international press about Fini's elegance. He does, in fact, wear designer glasses and trim-cut suits. But he is only modestly chic by Italian standards. What actually draws many Italians to Fini is his ordinariness, which he works hard to project. He, his wife, Daniela, and their 10-year-old daughter live in a suburb. He loves amateur boxing, takes his video  camera on vacation and likes to make political pronouncements at his favorite disco, his wife dancing wildly in the background.</p>
        <p>That said, some women find him irresistible, and he obviously enjoys the attention. One woman, for instance, asked Fini for an autograph but couldn't find any paper. So she opened her blouse and told Fini to sign her chest.</p>
        <p>Pity, he remarked, that his name is so short.</p>
        <p>"Politicians used to be old and invisible," he says. "Now there is a search on for fresh blood."</p>
        <p>What endears Fini to mother and daughter alike is that all of his joshing is  done in good fun -- he lets everyone know that he loves his wife and makes a point of championing monogamy as part of his party's traditional values. He is,  in short, the good son any Italian mother would like to have.</p>
        <p>Daniela, on the other hand, is a lot more out there, a Roman version of Madonna who is every bit as popular as her husband is. She still has Fascist sympathies, sports a tattoo and loves to unload her pistol at shooting ranges around the city. She charmed Italians recently when she said in a television interview that it was more important for her soccer team than for her husband to win.</p>
        <p>Harmless as Fini may seem, his opponents fear that his success could act as a sort of welcome wagon for all kinds of right-wing nuts, including those in his own party. While Fini's politics are driven more by personality than by issues,  his party's platform is still nebulous. Local party offices are sometimes hotbeds of racism, homophobia and antifeminism. Nevertheless, few think that a Fini victory would endanger democracy. In a country that has had 55 Governments  since World War II, the chances that Fini or his party would survive long enough to cause any real damage are low. What is perhaps more worrisome is the climate  change that a neo-Fascist victory in Italy could trigger elsewhere in Europe. Once neo- or post-Fascists are welcomed at one table, it's that much harder to deny them a place at another.</p>
        <p>For the time being, Fini has his eyes on one prize: a constitutional reform that will allow Italians to elect their president directly, as in France. However, even Fini says Italy isn't ready for a "post-Fascist" president and refuses to speculate on when it will be. "It's in the laps of the gods -- nobody knows," he says. "But things are accelerating."</p>
        <p>JORG HAIDER</p>
        <p>JORG HAIDER WAS SITTING DOWN FOR ANOTHER OF HIS frequent made-for-television interviews when the sound technician noticed a problem. An intercom chattering away with a debate in Parliament was interfering with the camera crew's sound system. "Is it possible to shut off Parliament?" asked the technician. "Not yet," joked Europe's most successful right-wing extremist.</p>
        <p>The remark was typical Haider: a touch of humor for his million or so working-class and anti-Establishment constituents and a sly reminder for Europe  that it's got a potentially dangerous bully in its midst, masked by a winning smile and packaged in a trim build.</p>
        <p>Over the last 10 years, Haider has ratcheted his Freedom Party up to an astonishing 22 percent of the vote through a relentless populist attack on Austria's stodgy democracy. Along the way he has blamed immigrants for just about everything -- calling them parasites -- and indulged in bouts of Nazi nostalgia. He has praised Hitler's "proper employment policy," referred to concentration camps like Auschwitz as "punishment camps" and refused to issue a  blanket condemnation of the SS.</p>
        <p>"It's wrong to say an organization is a criminal organization on the whole,"  Haider said recently. "You cannot say some of this organization are criminals and therefore the whole organization is a criminal organization."</p>
        <p>Haider is too clever to say anything directly against Jews or other minority  groups. But, like a David Duke or George Wallace in America, he acts as official taboo breaker, saying subtly what many people may be thinking, things like putting an end to all of this Holocaust talk by proposing a general amnesty for  old Nazis.</p>
        <p>"It is necessary to draw a line after all these events, after 50 years," he says.</p>
        <p>At this point, virtually no Austrians see Haider objectively -- they've lived with him too long and he is too polarizing. He is either vilified as the second  coming of Hitler -- yes, he came from Austria too -- or championed as the fair-haired boy who will save the nation.</p>
        <p>Wearing hiking books and blue jeans, Haider plops down in his Vienna office below framed photos of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver, the United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, and an anonymous border guard. "Gruss Gott," he says. "May God greet you" -- the standard hello in Austria. He  looks at least a decade younger than his 46 years.</p>
        <p>The curious photo gallery -- he appears in nearly every picture -- sums up his method: a glimmer of Hollywood, some legitimate politics and constant scapegoating of immigrants. Haider is, in fact, the closest thing Austria has to a screen idol, adept at marketing his good looks. In one notable instance he posed practically nude for a women's magazine. "It was an interesting project,"  he says. "A new type of politician in Austria. He is like he is."</p>
        <p>Just the very mention of Haider elicits a swoon from a top United States diplomat and a paraphrase of a line from "My Fair Lady." With a smile, she says, "You know -- he has so much charm he just oiled his way across the dance floor."</p>
        <p>"Oily is right," says her less-smitten Austrian assistant.</p>
        <p>Haider, who holds a seat in Parliament and is chairman of the Freedom Party,  is unlikely to win a national election outright. Nevertheless, he could be called upon after the next general election, in 1999, to participate in a coalition Government. That makes more than a few people nervous. He talks vaguely about setting up a "third republic," which sounds uncomfortably like the Third Reich. He has said he would like to combine the chancellor's and president's positions and possibly move the Justice and Interior Departments into a "Security Ministry."</p>
        <p>What's clear to Haider and everyone else is that Austria's current, second, republic is in a rut after spending the better part of the last 50 years under coalition rule -- something akin to a perpetual Clinton-Gingrich headlock. The Government hasn't tamed record unemployment or agreed on how to reduce a mammoth budget deficit. Haider's staff feeds the public a steady diet of corruption scandals that further tarnish the political establishment. And Haider serves up  easy answers to difficult questions like joblessness: "There are 140,000 unemployed Austrians," he likes to say, and "180,000 foreigners."</p>
        <p>Haider's parents were devoted, card-carrying Nazis. His father, a shoemaker,  joined a Hitler Youth group in 1929, when he was 15, and later helped bring Hitler's ideology to this tiny mountainous country. "He's typical for this older generation," Haider says. "He was engaged as a Nazi, had a vision of another world, a better world, and was disappointed and destroyed, totally destroyed. Then he had to start once more to rebuild his life."</p>
        <p>The de-Nazification program carried out by the Allies doesn't appear to have  worked on Haider or on a troubling number of his countrymen. Anti-Semitism and racism bubble to the surface quicker here than in neighboring Germany. Haider, for his part, says he might have done exactly what his father did. "I'm far from saying I would have chosen my way in another form if I were in the same situation."</p>
        <p>Haider's hesitance to condemn his family's Nazi past is all the more troubling when you consider the source of his considerable wealth: a 3,800-acre  Alpine estate sold to a relative by a Jewish owner fleeing from the Nazis. Haider insists it was "a fair transaction," but others -- including the Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal, who has followed Haider's career -- scoff at that.</p>
        <p>Although a champion of traditional family values, Haider keeps his home life  off-limits to the press. Even his political intimates say nobody really knows him. He is married to an Austrian hausfrau and has two teen-age daughters, but none of them play any significant role in his career. Because Haider surrounds himself with young men and is rarely seen in public with his wife, Austrian and  German reporters have taken to calling his Freedom Party a "little-boys' club."</p>
        <p>"We make a good distinction between the private life and the political life,  and I think it is a good thing," Haider says.</p>
        <p>Odd that Haider's skin is still a tad thin after all these years. He has built up his career by attacking others and has sued everyone from Wiesenthal to a schoolteacher who dared to denounce him in the classroom. To Haider's dismay,  the Simon Wiesenthal Center's Museum of Tolerance in Los Angeles has hung his picture in the "Contemporary Demagogues" section, along with those of Idi Amin,  David Duke and Jean-Marie Le Pen.</p>
        <p>"And there he shall stay," Wiesenthal says confidently. "History doesn't repeat itself. People just keep making the same mistakes."</p>
        <p>FILIP DEWINTER FILIP DEWINTER GOT INTO POLITICS WITH HIS FISTS, AND HE still enjoys a good brawl. But the fight he is waging this particular morning in Brussels requires a more diplomatic approach.</p>
        <p>A top leader of the extreme-right Vlaams Blok, Dewinter has called a news conference to try to charm his way off Belgium's "black list," a federal index of potential threats to national security. How is it possible, he asks, that a democratic political party -- representing 13 percent of Belgium's Flemish-speaking electorate -- could be lumped together with Islamic militants?</p>
        <p>Part of the answer lies with the Vlaams Blok member who -- almost as Dewinter spoke -- was being arrested on suspicion of smuggling mercenaries and weapons to white resistance groups in South Africa. Fifteen years earlier the same man had  been expelled from the United States after meeting with a white supremacist, J.  B. Stoner. "I'm not responsible for every weirdo and lunatic who's thinking he can organize a sort of violent revolution over here," Dewinter says.</p>
        <p>For journalists this morning, the incident was further proof that Dewinter and some of his compatriots have even more in store for Belgium than what is listed in the party platform -- which is pretty horrific in its own right. The Vlaams Blok is calling for the partition of Belgium, to cut Flanders loose from  the poorer Francophone region of Wallonia. And it advocates the forced deportation of non-European immigrants according to a plan that looks similar to the Nazis' Nuremberg race laws. The party's motto: "Our Own People First."</p>
        <p>Dewinter, 33, says he would also like to set up a European federation of right-wing extremists. He has visited the like-minded in Croatia, Russia, Ukraine and South Africa. He plans an expedition to the United States in the spring. The morning's news conference -- a public-relations disaster for any other party -- was still a good show for the Vlaams Blok and its star parliamentarian. Dewinter got his baby face on television and scored a few digs  against the beleaguered Belgian Government. He had, in other words, gone down swinging.</p>
        <p>"You should never run away," Dewinter says. "In our movement, you have to defend yourself sometimes. We are not the smooth and easy politicians of the traditional parties."</p>
        <p>From the outside, Dewinter's English-style-cottage home looks like the others that fill the suburbs around Antwerp -- if you overlook the 15-foot sign featuring a clenched fist and the exhortation "Beat corruption, vote Vlaams Blok." Inside, his two youngest daughters are playing with dolls in a cheerfully sunny playroom. Dewinter's wife, Lutgarde, and their oldest daughter are running late, returning from a Flemish youth club. He really is, as many friends say, a  doting father, the flip side to his tough image.</p>
        <p>One needn't look very hard, however, to find clues as to why Belgian authorities are so leery of him. On one of his bookshelves is a heavy marble sculpture of the Celtic cross, adopted by some neo-Nazis as their version of the swastika. On a dresser, a photo of the French far-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen mingles with those of Dewinter's wife and kids. For Dewinter, Le Pen is like family, a father figure even.</p>
        <p>Dewinter's own father -- a railroad administrator -- was also a Flemish nationalist, his mother a mainstream conservative. Born in the fairy-tale-like city of Bruges, Dewinter says he was a bit spoiled as an only child. He dropped  out of college -- after getting into serious fights with left-wing extremists -- but he managed to pick up a degree from a journalists' trade school.</p>
        <p>Dewinter walks past two tasteful paintings from Flemish artists, uncertain whether they are from the 16th, 17th or 18th century. He picks up a pair of boxing gloves and grins. "Let's knock down the Government," he says, echoing the feelings of an ever-increasing number of his countrymen.</p>
        <p>Belgians joke that their country is the most democratic in the world -- and the most divided. One national Parliament and six assemblies and councils serve  the Flemish-, French- and German-speaking communities, and there is a prime minister and a king -- all for 10 million citizens in a country the size of Maryland. This national identity crisis -- coupled with an ongoing corruption scandal and a growing immigrant community -- provides fertile ground for the Vlaams Blok, which has grown steadily since 1981. In Antwerp, Belgium's second biggest city, it is now the largest party, with 27 percent of the vote.</p>
        <p>After visiting America last year -- where he says he saw for himself that multiculturalism would never work -- Dewinter is now more committed than ever to his immigration policies. Immigrants, nearly a third of them from Islamic countries, make up about 10 percent of Belgium's population. Under his so-called 70-point plan, Dewinter would deny non-European immigrants the right to vote, put their children in separate schools, force their employers to pay higher taxes and deport as many as possible, even second- and third-generation citizens. "We must stop the Islamic invasion," he says. "It's very difficult to  accept somebody over here who believes in Islam. I think it's, in fact, impossible to assimilate in our country if you are of Islamic belief."</p>
        <p>Dewinter makes his strongest electoral showings in mixed neighborhoods -- he  calls them ghettos -- where poor whites feel "Islamicized," as he puts it. Dewinter denies that he is bigoted, though he concedes that some of his followers are. "A lot of people are becoming racist," he says. With national elections three years off, Dewinter busies himself now with foreign affairs, by  which he means helping other extremists fire up their nationalist movements, just as Le Pen once did for him.</p>
        <p>On his office wall, the fighter in him has hung a poster from his nationalist friends in the Balkans. "Croatia needs you now," it reads. "I saw the whole nation was fighting for this," he says. "It was not only a small group of military men. No, it was a whole nation who stood with their army and the people who were fighting. And that was really amazing to see, that something like that  could happen."</p>
