        <p>A few weeks before hurricane season, the Commerce Department blocked the release of a document describing possible links between global warming and hurricanes, according to a news article today in the journal Nature. The journal cited e-mail exchanges between officials and scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration obtained under Freedom of Information laws by the environmental group Greenpeace. Jordan St. John, a NOAA spokesman, said the document was an information sheet being prepared for journalists but not finished in time.
