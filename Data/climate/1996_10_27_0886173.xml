        <p>LOOKING FOR NO. 1</p>
        <p>AT&amp;T Beats the Press  When AT&amp;T picked its next boss, it almost seemed that its main goal was surprise. At that, it clearly succeeded. Everyone -- at least those who care about such things -- was convinced the company would turn to some heavy-hitter in telecommunications. Instead, it picked John R. Walter, who made his name as head of a catalogue printer, R. R. Donnelley &amp; Sons. AT&amp;T won this round of ''Beat the Press,'' for while the media hovered hungrily over this search -- the biggest since I.B.M. was looking for a leader -- there wasn't a peep about Mr. Walter. In fact, after he was chosen but before the tightly guarded secret was let out, Mr. Walter was at a dinner and a fellow chief executive (they travel in packs, apparently) said, ''I believe I'm sitting with the next president of AT&amp;T.'' He was talking, though, about someone else. But beating the press did not impress investors, as AT&amp;T stock lost nearly 5 percent in a day.</p>
        <p>AIRLINES</p>
        <p>Resignation at T.W.A.  What's the worst job in the world? That's a tough one, but running an airline that has a devastating accident has to be high on the list. And last week Jeffrey Erickson had enough. Mr. Erickson, T.W.A.'s chief executive, resigned three months after Flight 800 went down. Ticket sales have, predictably, slumped since the crash, mainly on international routes, and the airline just reported a $14.3 million third-quarter loss. But most unpleasant to Mr. Erickson could well have been the suggestions that he, and the airline, had acted insensitively after the crash -- that, for instance, T.W.A. had been too slow in notifying families. A relative of two victims, though, called Mr. Erickson ''a very nice man'' though she also said, ''I probably would quit, too.''</p>
        <p>Flight 800: New Theories  T.W.A. Flight 800 went down, investigators say, because fuel vapors exploded in the center tank. That tank is often empty, since jets rarely need all their fuel capacity, and when it's empty, the vapors can be highly volatile. But here's the latest twist: there's a method for flushing out those explosive vapors, and the F.A.A. actually wanted to require it 24 years ago, but the industry balked, calling it too costly. If the rule had been in place, investigators contend, the plane might have been saved -- whether the explosion was mechanical failure or sabotage. Needless to say, everyone is taking a hard second look at this idea.</p>
        <p>PODIATRISTS</p>
        <p>Giving H.M.O.'s a Kick  Wait a second. If podiatrists form a union and walk off their jobs, and their feet start to hurt, who will tend to them? Never mind, because even though they did form a union last week -- with a mouthful of a name: the First National Guild for Health Care Providers of the Lower Extremities -- they said they anticipated no strikes. The purpose, instead, is to do battle with H.M.O.'s, which, some podiatrists contend, are eroding their livelihoods by dictating salaries and steering patients to, say, orthopedists. The birth of this group is a striking twist in the health care upheaval, for this is the first nationwide doctors' union, with at least 10,000 of the 14,000 American podiatrists expected to join.</p>
        <p>ANIMALS (STUFFED)</p>
        <p>Dalmatian Alert!  Someday, in some far-off kingdom, a truly magical event will occur: A Disney movie will come out and there will be no dolls, no logo-encrusted pajamas, no product tie-ins. No, scratch that. Even children would never believe such an outlandish tale. Get back to reality, specifically, this terrifying reality: the dalmatians are here. With the new ''101 Dalmatians'' due in a few weeks, the product marketing is hitting like a furry sledgehammer, with a nearly full-page Macy's ad last week devoted to Dalmatian gift tins, Dalmatian slippers, Dalmatian Christmas stockings. And stuffed animals? Of course! Folks planning tag sales next year are counting on them.</p>
        <p>PENSIONS</p>
        <p>Support Your Local Contra?  Speaking of pensions, of income for retirement -- everyone, of course, speaks of these now -- what, exactly, constitutes an American employee? Congress recently authorized $20 million in payments to Vietnamese commandos trained by the C.I.A.. But by that logic, wouldn't Nicaragua's contras also deserve a little something? Yes, yes, President Reagan always said they were noble freedom fighters, but that idea has long since been exploded. By one estimate, 20,000 former contras live in dire poverty in northern Nicaragua, and they want support from their former employer -- Washington. Nicaragua's President-elect, Arnoldo Aleman, has promised them nothing, and President Clinton has other things on his mind. Even Elliott Abrams, a front-row contra cheerleader in the Reagan State Department, does not see direct aid as ''morally persuasive.''</p>
        <p>SOLAR POWER</p>
        <p>For Pataki, Too Much Sun  Gov. George Pataki says he wants to be a good environmentalist, yet he could not quite bring himself to sign a bill that would have let New York State homeowners install solar panels and then, in effect, run their electric meters backward -- selling extra power back to utilities. Why did he veto it? Mr. Pataki said it was concern for safety, painting a grim picture of a utility worker repairing a downed power line and getting an unexpected high-voltage gift from a solar homeowner. Nonsense, said environmentalists; safety standards meet national codes. ''The safety argument was bogus,'' said one, contending that Mr. Pataki was buddies with the utility industry and ''bowed to that pressure.''</p>
        <p>LOSS LEADER</p>
        <p>But Does He Play a Harp?  It's so outlandish that you can just imagine Harpo and Groucho concocting the plan: simply forge a few signatures on documents that authorize them to have their way with vast sums of money. But this is no long-lost Marx Brothers movie (though you can just see Harpo's eyes dancing); it is, Japanese officials say, reality. Yasuo Hamanaka, you'll recall, is the Sumitomo copper trader who defied the most fantastical odds by piling up $2.6 billion in trading losses. Last week Mr. Hamanaka was arrested in Japan and charged with forging signatures that said, in effect, that he could buy and sell all the copper he wanted. Sumitomo still contended that his bosses were in the dark, though one might expect a missing $2.6 billion to make a quite visible hole in any wallet.</p>
        <p>BOO!</p>
        <p>Some Pretty Scary Numbers  You'd think, wouldn't you, that Christmas could dispose of any rival shopping holiday with the flick of a reindeer's tail. But no. Americans crave excess, and apparently even Christmas can't supply enough of it, so they've turned their gaze to Halloween. We now spend at least $2.5 billion a year on goblin day (gobblin' day is next month), making it second only to its December rival as a retailing blowout, ahead of both Mother's Day and Easter. But do you poke a couple of holes in a sheet these days, or put on a homemade cardboard mask? Forget it, unless you want to cause your offspring terminal embarrassment. No, you shell out $50 for a costume, get a Cryptkeeper battery-operated doorbell, buy Oreos with orange filling -- and please don't forget the ''baby's first Halloween'' greeting card. What's going on? Psychological theories are thick as witches: the little darlings are simply ''managing their stress'' by wandering in the dark and threatening people, and adults -- yes, fully 65 percent of sales are for adults -- are in ''perpetual adolescence'' or feeding their ''inner child.'' Don't buy that? Well, then it must be global warming.</p>
