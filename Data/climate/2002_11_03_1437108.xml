        <p>DEAD CITIES</p>
        <p>And Other Tales.</p>
        <p>By Mike Davis.</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 432 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>The New Press. $27.95.</p>
        <p>HOW to classify Mike Davis? Is he the Cassandra of our age, prophesying disasters to which we, like the citizens of doomed Troy, willfully stop our ears? Or is he what Anthony Trollope called Thomas Carlyle, Mr. Pessimist Anticant, a neurotic gloom-and-doom monger?</p>
        <p>As a social critic, Davis positions himself outside the whale, as Orwell instructed, and well to the left of ''Leviathan.'' The biographical sketch on the jacket of ''City of Quartz,'' published in 1990, was pugnaciously proletarian, describing the author (under a ferocious photograph) as ''a former meatcutter and long-distance truck driver.'' Since the success of that book, Davis has been lionized and his radical fangs somewhat blunted. Nowadays, there is less meat cleaver and teamster machismo attaching to his image. He has taken up various university posts and even received the accolade of a MacArthur ''genius'' grant.</p>
        <p>The subject that Davis has made peculiarly his own is the modern metropolis, Cobbett's ''great wen.'' For Davis, it is a city of dreadful night, a city of destruction, Vanity Fair. Carthage, for Davis, is always delenda, Pompeii always in its last days.</p>
        <p>Literary historians will place him in the tradition of urban satire originating in Juvenal. It is, however, less his Juvenalian eloquence than his Nostradamian power of prophecy that sells Davis's books. ''City of Quartz'' was elevated to canonical status by the Rodney King riots, which eerily bore out the author's predictions. Davis followed up with another jeremiad on Los Angeles, ''Ecology of Fear.'' Its forecast -- that the city would be torn apart by tornadoes, inundated by El Niño-driven downpours and rattled to bits by earthquakes -- awaits fulfillment.</p>
        <p>The 9/11 catastrophe was something for which Mike Davis had been in literary training for years. The preface of his new collection, ''Dead Cities,'' is called ''The Flames of New York'' and was first published, as the debris of the World Trade Center still smoldered, in New Left Review, the house journal of British Marxism. Or what's left of it.</p>
        <p>The terrorist attack on the United States was bound to happen, Davis implies. The signs were there, just like the crop circles in Mel Gibson's cornfields. His essay takes as its text a passage from H. G. Wells's 1908 novel, ''The War in the Air,'' which begins: ''Lower Manhattan was soon a furnace of crimson flames, from which there was no escape.'' Davis pictures a copy of Wells's scientific romance lying in the vaults of the New York Public Library, unread ''for nearly a century,'' as the towers burn a few miles downtown. ''Sci-fi happens,'' he informs us.</p>
        <p>Davis is not recycling the platitude that literature and life mirror each other. Instead, he is arguing that popular narrative foresaw 9/11. ''The X-Files,'' he declares, ''defined the 1990's in the same way that 'The Honeymooners' had defined the 1950's. It was an age of inexplicable anxiety.'' Explicable now, of course. The enigmatic messages in crop circles and chicken entrails make perfect sense after disaster strikes.</p>
        <p>The concluding section of Davis's essay (''Tous Martiens'' -- we're all Martians now) turns to the breakdown of liberal values in the United States after 9/11. ''Very little of the violent domestic backlash has been reported in the mainstream media,'' Davis claims (dubiously). He compares that American ''backlash'' to the homicidal ''Arab hunts'' the French sanctioned as they were losing the Algerian war of independence. Frantz Fanon, he speculates, ''probably would not be surprised that frustrated F.B.I. investigators, like the French Sûreté before them, are lobbying to take recalcitrant suspects down to the scream-proof basement where the batteries and electrodes are kept.'' There comes a point in all Davis's tirades when, like a poker player, he calls the reader. Do we go along with him or fold? Many, I suspect, will fold.</p>
        <p>''Dead Cities'' looks like an opportunistic volume, hung on the hook of this topical but already dated opening essay. The rest of the book scoops up 10 years' worth of Davis's occasional writing and journalism. The essays range widely, and some scarcely warrant the dignity of reprinting. They are, nonetheless, united by Davis's unrelenting severity of vision. ''Genocide'' and ''Holocaust'' are two of his favorite words. Although they are most commonly used to describe the crimes done to European Jewry during World War II, Davis likes to bend them around so that readers see themselves as complicitous in equivalently hideous acts: ''Adolf Eichmann, c'est vous.''</p>
        <p>His first chapter, ''White People Are Only a Bad Dream,'' begins with a rumination on Native American ghost dancers and the massacre of the Lakota Sioux at Wounded Knee by ''the big explosive rounds of the Army's new Hotchkiss guns,'' an event ''the government still falsely characterizes as an 'uprising.' '' Your government, that is.</p>
        <p>Your government's malefactions transcend the linguistic. In ''Ecocide in Marlboro Country'' and ''Berlin's Skeleton in Utah's Closet,'' Davis's gaze shifts to Tooele County, Utah, and ''the Apocalyptic Kingdom that the Department of Defense has built in the desert West,'' particularly at the Dugway Proving Ground, which he calls ''the devil's own laboratory.'' In this region, the American government has conducted tests on a barrage of deadly biological, chemical and nuclear weapons, sometimes on live volunteers but more frequently (in the case of Army personnel and local inhabitants) on less-than-volunteers. These ''atomic plagues,'' ''secret holocausts'' and environmental ''ecocides'' have been financed with a ''huge black budget.'' A budget paid for with your money.</p>
        <p>The deadest of all cities in Davis's survey is the mock German village set up at Dugway during World War II to test new-fangled incendiary weapons with which to ''carbonize'' luckless enemy civilians. The Army permitted Davis and a dozen of his students at the Southern California Institute of Architecture to visit this site in 1997. (Big mistake.) The resulting essay inspires his sharpest polemical writing.</p>
        <p>Much of this book will be of particular interest to residents of Los Angeles. ''Who Killed L.A.?'' one essay inquires. Another excoriates ''The Subway That Ate L.A.'' ''Hollywood's Dark Shadow'' is also explored. There is a side trip to Las Vegas, whose destruction, one learns, will likely come from ''its summer flash-flood problem.'' It is, Davis tells us, ''probably the city's best-kept secret.'' That and how to win at roulette.</p>
        <p>''Dead Cities'' concludes with an essay on global catastrophe. Here Davis turns his prophetic eye from the ''toxic metropolis'' to the frozen (but no longer sufficiently frozen) poles. ''It is,'' he declares, ''the hermaphroditic polar bears that most haunt me.''</p>
        <p>It's hopeless. ''Even if the West Lawn turned into a sand dune or monkeys jabbered in the galleries of Congress, energy industry lobbyists -- echoed by Rush Limbaugh -- would still decry global warming as science fiction.'' Cassandra, as always, wails in vain. And what does she say? ''Sci-fi happens.''</p>
