        <p>THIS COLD HEAVEN: Seven Seasons in Greenland, by Gretel Ehrlich. (Vintage, $14.) The author's extended travels among the Greenland natives took place during a period of transition in the 1990's, when a 5,000-year-old subsistence culture was threatened by global warming and the temptations of the modern world. ''Ehrlich has written a stunning portrait of a people and the landscape that shaped them,'' Elizabeth Royte said here in 2001. ''Her story has great emotional and physical sweep, and one shares her loss at leaving this peculiarly fascinating place.''</p>
        <p>THE LOVE OF STONES, by Tobias Hill. (Picador USA, $14.) This thriller by a British poet follows the fortunes of a spectacular medieval jewel and the people consumed by it: among them a pair of Jewish traders who arrive in London in 1833 with gems sewn into their cloaks and, many years later, a young Englishwoman in hot pursuit of the treasure. ''The novel gives the reader the sense that for Hill no word is wasted,'' Neil Freudenberger said here last year.</p>
        <p>SEARCHING FOR INTRUDERS: A Novel in Stories, by Stephen Raleigh Byler. (Perennial/HarperCollins, $12.95.) Exploring terrain charted by Richard Ford and Raymond Carver, the stories in this first collection are confident and ruefully funny as they examine what might be called post-postmacho manhood. Though uneven, the tales are often ''artful and affecting,'' Dwight Garner wrote in these pages in 2001.</p>
        <p>GENES, GIRLS, AND GAMOW: After the Double Helix, by James D. Watson. (Vintage, $14.) The author, who together with Francis Crick discovered DNA, recounts his formative encounters with an international cadre of iconoclastic scientists (including the physicist George Gamow) and his arduous struggle to find two things: a girl and the mysteries of RNA. The result is ''a priceless glimpse into the intellectual circle that nurtured his revolutionary paradigm,'' Barbara Ehrenreich wrote here in 2002.</p>
        <p>GRACEFULLY INSANE: Life and Death Inside America's Premier Mental Hospital, by Alex Beam. (PublicAffairs, $15.) Tucked away in bucolic Belmont, Mass., McLean Hospital has been caring for an elite clientele since the 19th century, with varying degrees of success. Among its former patients are Ray Charles, John Forbes Nash, Sylvia Plath and James Taylor. The author weaves ''an account of changing attitudes toward mental illness, the methods employed in its treatment and the shifting context of the larger culture into an entertaining narrative that centers on the hospital and its history,'' Holly Brubach said here last year. In the Freud Archives, by Janet Malcolm (New York Review, $12.95), is the wryly told story (later the subject of a famous libel trial) of the fractious relationship among three men: a former psychoanalyst turned virulent anti-Freudian, a self-described ''punk historian of psychoanalysis'' and the eminently orthodox founder of the Freud Archives. Reviewing this ''wonderfully entertaining performance'' here in 1984, Harold Bloom praised ''Malcolm's winning exuberance as a writer.''</p>
        <p>JUST LIKE BEAUTY, by Lisa Lerner. (Picador, $13.) As she prepares for the Feminine Woman of Conscience beauty pageant, this first novel's gloomy 14-year-old narrator starts to have serious qualms about an absurd contest in which girls perform oral sex on blowup men and sacrifice rabbits they've raised as pets. The result is ''a work of striking lyricism and jittery energy,'' Emily White said in the Book Review last year. ''Lerner writes in a prose style that's intricate, poetic and full of surprises.''</p>
        <p>FALLING ANGELS, by Tracy Chevalier. (Plume, $13.) This novel about two upper-middle-class families in early-20th-century London centers on a pair of little girls who are best friends but whose fates lie in opposite directions. ''Chevalier is a master of voices,'' Janice P. Nimura wrote here in 2001. ''In brief first-person narrations, she skips from parents to children to servants, touching on the details of life upstairs and down with grace and clarity.''</p>
        <p>BITTEN. WOMEN OF THE OTHERWORLD: Book I, by Kelley Armstrong. (Plume, $13.) Elena Michaels is more than a 30-year-old journalist with a devoted boyfriend: she's a practicing werewolf. Despite her attempts to live an ordinary life, she gets caught up in a gang war between two clans of werewolves. In 2001 in these pages, Jennifer Reese called this ''a rather sweet love story'' that suggests ''that being a wolf may be more comfortable for a strong, smart young woman than being a human.''</p>
