        <p>LEAD: Vowing not to repeat the six weeks of Senate floor fights over an overhaul of the Clean Air Act, the House of Representatives opened debate on its own version today, and lawmakers said there was wide support for passage.</p>
        <p>Vowing not to repeat the six weeks of Senate floor fights over an overhaul of the Clean Air Act, the House of Representatives opened debate on its own version today, and lawmakers said there was wide support for passage.</p>
        <p>While a few contentious issues remain, like whether to require auto makers to produce cars that do not run on gasoline, most disputes that were outstanding when the House Energy and Commerce Committee overwhelmingly approved the measure last month were resolved in behind-the-scenes negotiations that continued this evening. The House is scheduled to begin voting on the bill on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>The bill calls for broad revisions to the Clean Air Act, with measures to meet air quality standards in polluted areas, tighter automobile tailpipe emission standards, requirements for the sale of cleaner fuels and a new program to significantly cut emissions that cause acid rain. While the White House is expected to oppose certain provisions, officials in the Bush Administration say there is general support for the House measure.</p>
        <p>Bipartisan Momentum Cited</p>
        <p>After a 10-year logjam on the environmental legislation, several lawmakers credited the bipartisan momentum in the House for passage in part to the Administration's push for a clean air bill this year and to the Senate's passage of its own version last month.</p>
        <p>But most of all, they cited a smoothing of relations between Representative John D. Dingell, a Michigan Democrat who, as chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, has vigorously defended the interests of auto makers, and Representative Henry A. Waxman, a California Democrat who has been in the vanguard on many environmental issues. Mr. Dingell, facing pressure from the Administration and Congressional leaders for stringent legislation, agreed to compromises on several issues and supported the overall package.</p>
        <p>Several lawmakers said today that they never thought Mr. Dingell and Mr. Waxman would reach an accommodation.</p>
        <p>''If anybody had ever told me that a John-Henry agreement could be struck on tailpipe emissions, I would have said that the heavens would have had to have parted the skies, the earth would have rolled and the clouds would have rumbled,'' said Representative Dennis E. Eckart, an Ohio Democrat who is a member of the committee. ''But in fact they did.''</p>
        <p>In opening the floor debate today, Mr. Dingell said of Mr. Waxman, who is chairman of the Subcommittee on Health and the Environment, ''It has not always been a pleasure to work with him, but in this instance we have been able to do quite well.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Waxman, in turn, cited Mr. Dingell as one of many colleagues who were instrumental in writing the bill, and said, ''I think back about how attitudes have changed.''</p>
        <p>Compromise on Key Amendments</p>
        <p>Seeking to avoid floor fights, House negotiators in recent days have reached a compromise on these key amendments, some of which were the subject of fractious debate in the Senate: requiring the sale of specially blended cleaner gasoline in nine urban areas, tightening enforcement and permit provisions, and protecting parks and wilderness areas from low visibility caused by nearby pollution sources.</p>
        <p>Other amendments will have to be fought out this week on the House floor. One would require auto makers to produce and oil companies to provide fuel for a million clean-fuel vehicles a year. Another would reduce production of chlorofluorocarbons and other chemicals that destroy the ozone layer. A ''clean coast'' provision would put new restrictions on offshore oil drilling platforms and their service vessels.</p>
        <p>Representative Terry L. Bruce, Democrat of Illinois, said that while he planned to propose a less restrictive amendment on chlorofluorcarbons, he was concerned that the issue could become a sticking point on the floor because of opposition from auto makers and others that use the chemicals.</p>
        <p>''It is the one amendment that scares me half to death,'' Mr. Bruce said. ''If we screw that up, the whole bill is going to be untenable.''</p>
        <p>In another action late today that could threaten wide support for the legislation, the House Ways and Means Committee proposed an amendment that would strike user fees and tariffs from many of the bill's provisions.</p>
        <p>Congressional officials said the committee chairman, Representative Dan Rostenkowski, pressed for the changes because he believes they are taxes, not fees, and thus would come under his committee's jurisdiction. This could set up a clash between Mr. Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat, and Mr. Dingell, who are longtime rivals, but it was not clear how much support there would be for eliminating the fees.</p>
        <p>While relieved that compromises were reached on some important amendments, environmental groups said they were waiting for the floor action this week before making pronouncements about the legislation.</p>
        <p>''Issues that we thought were going to be major issues on the floor are no longer contentious,'' said Richard E. Ayres, chairman of the National Clean Air Coalition, which represents about three dozen organizations that support more stringent environmental measures. ''But the two votes that we see as the biggest votes are on clean cars and ozone depletion.''</p>
        <p>Higher Costs Predicted</p>
        <p>William D. Fay, administrator of the Clean Air Working Group, an industry coalition that opposes the legislation, said the House measure is tilted against business interests.</p>
        <p>''You have amendments that, if adopted, are going to take the price of this bill into orbit,'' he said. ''The environmental community is pretty insatiable when it comes to their demands. Yet I think the President and Congress have to find a balance. That balance isn't going to be found by simply adopting everything the environmental community wants.''</p>
        <p>In assessing the Senate and House measures, both environmentalists and industry representatives said it was hard to determine which bill called for stronger provisions to reduce pollution.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ayres said the Senate measure had stronger provisions on tailpipe standards and motor vehicle emissions in general, while the House bill called for stronger standards to control urban smog.</p>
