        <p>President Bush's new budget calls for the most ambitious overhaul of government priorities that any president has proposed in decades. He wants deep tax cuts and big spending increases for the military and domestic security. A balanced budget is no longer an important goal. Nor is shrinking the size of government. ''This is a president of big projects and big ideas,'' said the budget director, Mitchell E. Daniels Jr.</p>
        <p>The budget envisions spending $2.23 trillion in the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1 and a deficit of $307 billion, both record amounts, even though most domestic programs would receive little new money.</p>
        <p>The Week in Review asked various interest groups -- antitax, pro-spending, anti-regulation, pro-environment -- to review the budget line by line, and list ways the government could save money. Some targets are hardy perennials, surviving because of influential constituencies. Others are new programs, like the hydrogen car. Here, a few of the suggestions.</p>
        <p>DAVID E. ROSENBAUM</p>
        <p>Corporations on the Dole?  Cato Institute, which advocates limited government.</p>
        <p>Hydrogen car -- The Bush administration wants to spend $1.5 billion over five years to develop a hydrogen-powered car. The Clinton administration spent more than $1 billion to create hybrid gas and electric cars. But subsidies to the Big Three produced little, while unsubsidized Honda and Toyota brought hybrid cars to the market.</p>
        <p>Export-Import Bank -- This independent agency dishes out about $10 billion in loans and loan guarantees to corporations each year to finance foreign projects. Enron was one of the bank's biggest beneficiaries.</p>
        <p>Market Access Program -- Despite decades of criticism, this program keeps on ticking. The Agriculture Department spends $109 million to promote the products of companies like Sunkist, Welch's Food and the National Watermelon Promotion Board.</p>
        <p>Highway demonstration projects -- Highway spending would be increased by 6 percent, including the financing of demonstration projects, like the Bud Shuster Highway in Pennsylvania, named after the former leader of the House Transportation Committee.</p>
        <p>Cut the Tax Cuts  Citizens for Tax Justice, which says it favors a progressive tax system that raises enough to pay for government services.</p>
        <p>Tax exemption for dividends -- This $364 billion item would add to the plethora of tax shelters. The top 1 percent of taxpayers would get most of the breaks.</p>
        <p>New tax-free savings accounts -- The few people who could afford it would be able to put upward of $60,000 a year into tax-sheltered accounts.</p>
        <p>The extension of the 2001 tax cuts -- Bush agreed to terminate his 2001 income and estate tax cuts after 2010; they otherwise cost far too much. Now, despite giant deficits, Bush wants to extend the cuts anyway at a cost of $231 billion a year.</p>
        <p>Trains, Cars and Electricity  National Taxpayers Union, which advocates lower taxes and less spending.</p>
        <p>Hydrogen car -- A lose-lose proposition. The government replaces private investors and underwrites dead-end research.</p>
        <p>Power Marketing Administrations -- Created to bring cheap electricity to rural areas, the agencies long ago fulfilled their mission and now often crowd out private companies. Yet their total gross budget would rise 5 percent.</p>
        <p>Amtrak -- When the national passenger railroad began in 1971, the Nixon administration hoped it would become self-sustaining in about three years. Today, the White House proposes to raise its capital grants.</p>
        <p>Gas and Oil Exploration and Technology Programs -- The Energy Department programs, which have cost $1.4 billion over the last 22 years, are meant to help companies develop better ways to produce gas and oil. But they were rated as ''ineffective'' this year in the administration's own budget.</p>
        <p>Military Non-Needs  Taxpayers for Common Sense, a nonpartisan budget agency.</p>
        <p>Comanche helicopter -- The initial Army estimates for development were $3.6 billion over eight years. Twenty years later, the costs have risen to $8.3 billion and not a single helicopter has been produced.</p>
        <p>F/A-22 fighter jets -- The Air Force wants 22 jets, at a cost of $5.2 billion, despite cost overruns and the nation's air superiority.</p>
        <p>Clean Coal Technology Program -- Since the mid-80's, this Energy Department program has received more than $2.4 billion to finance research into technologies that haven't proved to be any cleaner than traditional ways of burning coal. Eliminating it would save $10 billion over the next 10 years.</p>
        <p>Timber subsidies -- The Forest Service spends hundreds of millions of dollars every year to subsidize private logging operations in national forests. Ending subsidies would save more than $2 billion over the next 10 years.</p>
        <p>Ethanol subsidies -- Since 1978, the government has granted numerous tax incentives and subsidies to promote the growth of a domestic ethanol industry. In 1997, the General Accounting Office gave out $7.1 billion in subsidies to agribusinesses.</p>
        <p>Overregulating Industry  The Competitive Enterprise Institute, which advocates limited government and unfettered free enterprise.</p>
        <p>Hydrogen car -- The budget includes $740 million for research into hydrogen fuel cells for the ''FreedomCar'' project. But producing the hydrogen requires energy use from fossil fuels, nuclear or renewable sources. This will not cut energy dependence or greenhouse gases.</p>
        <p>Energy Department research and development -- The budget includes $1.7 billion for energy conservation, fossil energy research and development and renewable energy research. The Energy Department and the national laboratories have spent tens of billions on these projects since the 1970's, with few breakthroughs.</p>
        <p>The 2001 Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants -- The president has proposed spending $700 million to carry out this treaty, although the Senate has not yet ratified it. The treaty sets regulations on 12 chemicals, including the pesticide DDT, even though DDT controls malaria in the developing world.</p>
        <p>Farm subsidies -- The budget proposes $17 billion for farm subsidies. The budget analysis notes that the bulk of payments will go to the biggest and least financially strapped growers.</p>
        <p>From Forest to Sky  Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group.</p>
        <p>Hydrogen car -- It's 20 years away from development, and comes at the expense of other federal research into clean energy, which the budget would cut by $47 million.</p>
        <p>Subsidies to buy sport utility vehicles -- The budget would expand a tax loophole that allows any taxpayer using a vehicle for business to deduct up to $75,000 if buying S.U.V.'s that weigh more than 6,000 pounds, like the Hummer H2 and Lincoln Navigator.</p>
        <p>Nuclear energy research and development -- The budget proposes nearly a 19 percent increase over last year's request, including $63 million for pyroprocessing, which produces materials that can be diverted for nuclear weapons.</p>
        <p>'Clear Skies' initiative -- The budget dedicates $7.7 million to this new program, but its pollution-control targets are weaker than those in the current Clean Air Act.</p>
        <p>'Healthy Forests' initiative -- Adding to past subsidies to the timber industry, this new $182 million program claims to thin trees in fire-prone areas. In reality, it allows lumber companies to do harmful logging in remote parts of national forests.</p>
