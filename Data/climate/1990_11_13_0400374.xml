        <p>THE Malheur wire lettuce, an unprepossessing but rare plant that grows only in hot, dry central Oregon, appeared to have lost its struggle for survival.</p>
        <p>The few existing populations of the plant that managed to cling to life in its inhospitable ecological niche were gradually erased by the hoofs of cattle, foraging by jack rabbits, fire and an invasion of Asian cheat grass. By the early 1980's there were no plants of the species known to be alive.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Leslie D. Gottlieb, a professor of plant genetics at the University of California at Davis who discovered the plant in 1968, had stored a large number of its seeds. They were propagated at the Berry Botanic Garden in Portland, Ore., and the seedlings were planted on land managed by the Bureau of Land Management in Oregon. The extinct plant was returned to life. Efforts Are Paying Off</p>
        <p>The resurrection of the Malheur wire lettuce is one of a growing number of successes of a nationwide cooperative effort among scientists, botanical gardens, state and Federal governments, and the Nature Conservancy and other private conservation groups to preserve the nation's endangered flora.</p>
        <p>Don Falk, executive director of the Center for Plant Conservation, one of the groups leading the effort, said he believed that there need be no further losses of native plants.</p>
        <p>"We have set as a realistically attainable goal preventing from this point on any further extinctions of American flora," Mr. Falk said in a telephone interview.</p>
        <p>Saving every American plant would be a formidable task. There are about 25,000 native plants, of which 3,000 are considered in some danger of extinction. The Center for Plant Conservation has estimated that more than 700 plants will disappear in the next 10 years if strong measures are not taken to save them. More than a third of these could be wiped out in five years.</p>
        <p>While there are many sources of danger, the chief cause of extinction is the destruction of the plants' limited habitat by housing, industry or other human activity.</p>
        <p>"We are talking about protecting plant diversity on a continental scale and that is not a trivial exercise," said Mr. Falk. But he added: "This is not something we have any choice about. The consequences of not attending to the diversity of plant life would be felt fairly quickly as ecological communities deteriorate." Role as Food and Drugs</p>
        <p>Little is known about most of the rare endangered plants, but many of them are genetically related to food crops, including grains, vegetables and fruits. Many could have pharmaceutical value and many others should be saved for their beauty, Mr. Falk and others engaged in the rescue effort contend.</p>
        <p>As an example of the value of saving rare plants, Mr. Falk pointed to a Texas wild rice, Zizania texana, whose habitat is now reduced to a single stream in central Texas. The genetic characteristics that enable it to live in a hotter, drier climate could be used to extend the growing range of wild rice in the United States, where it is now generally limited to the North Central states.</p>
        <p>Even more important, he said, is the value of the wild rice's genes as insurance against a significant warming of the earth over the next century as a result of the greenhouse effect. If, as many scientists expect, rising global temperatures make the nation's interior hotter and drier, crops that can grow under such conditions would be urgently needed.</p>
        <p>"We are talking about a survival issue for Homo sapiens," Mr. Falk said.</p>
        <p>Last month the Center for Plant Conservation announced that to strengthen its efforts to preserve species, it was moving from Boston to St. Louis to affiliate with the Missouri Botanical Garden, a leading institution for plant research. The botanical garden is coordinating the preparation of a 12-volume "Flora of North America," which will be the first comprehensive listing and description of the plants of the United States, Canada and Greenland.</p>
        <p>Peter Raven, the director of the Missouri Botanical Garden, said his institution's wide and growing storehouse of information about native plants would fit directly into the Center for Plant Conservation's efforts to identify and collect plants that are in danger of disappearing.  Returning Plants to the Wild</p>
        <p>The next step after finding and collecting those endangered plants, he said, is reintroducing them into the wild. Preserving seeds or a few plants in botanical gardens does not permanently protect plants because their survival depends on money and continuing care by people that could be cut off. Only re-establishing plant communities in their natural setting can save them over the long run, he contended.</p>
        <p>Mr. Falk agrees. "A botanical garden is a holding pattern -- an ark," he said. "We have to find a place for the ark to land. Plants need to live in an ecological community with pollinators and symbiotic organisms such as fungi. Our objective is to restore species to a fully functioning existence in their ecological setting so that they can continue on their evolutionary pathway."</p>
        <p>But before endangered plants can be reintroduced into the wild, they must be found and collected. This task is shouldered in large part by natural heritage programs run by state governments in cooperation with scientific institutions and cultural groups. The Nature Conservancy, a private nonprofit group based in Arlington, Va., plays a major role in this program, providing technical support and a data base for state programs.</p>
        <p>Members of the the state programs meet at least once a year with the Center for Plant Conservation, representatives of botanical gardens, university scientists, Federal land managers and private conservation groups to discuss the status of the most critically threatened species and to determine which must be collected to assure their safety.</p>
        <p>Plants identified as being in trouble are collected, their seeds stored, and individual plants propagated and studied. "If you have only a few populations of a plant left, you don't dare mess around with it," said Robert E. Jenkins, vice president for science programs of the Nature Conservancy. "You have to study it in the greenhouse to find out how much sun it likes, whether or not it should be fertilized and watered. Only then can you think about reintroducing it into the wild." Some Are Skeptical</p>
        <p>Not all botanists think the goal of saving all native flora is realistic. Dr. Gottlieb of the University of California, for example, called the notion of zero losses of American plants romanticism. It would be a mistake to try, he said.</p>
        <p>"We must save those species we know are very important and, if we have the time and the money, save the rest," he said, adding that there are not enough money or scientists or other workers to save every plant in danger of extinction.</p>
        <p>He recalled that he had urged the California Fish and Game Commission, which decides which plants and animals to list as threatened or endangered, to try to save a plant called Oryctes nevadensis, a small annual herb in the tomato family that grows only in a few populations in the Owens Valley of California.</p>
        <p>The plant belongs to a family "of supreme economic importance" because its genetic structure is related to tomatoes, potatoes, tobacco and petunias, Dr. Gottlieb said. But the commission turned down his petition and spent its resources on what he said were much less important plants.</p>
        <p>At the time of the commission's action in 1989, one member of the panel was quoted by The Sacramento Bee as saying, "Here's a very weedy looking plant, and what I'm really wondering is, why are we worrying about it?' " The paper did not identify the member.</p>
        <p>Although Dr. Gottlieb calls for scientists to be selective in deciding which plants to rescue, many say virtually all native plants could be saved.</p>
        <p>"It is a lot easier to save plants than it is to save, say, spotted owls," said Bruce MacBryde, a botanist for the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.</p>
        <p>Mr. Falk says he is confident that his goal can be achieved. "Like any good doctor, I should never say never," he said. "But I really think we can pull it off -- that we will not lose a single native plant. We have a system now we believe will enable us to prevent anything from slipping through the cracks." Zizania texana Texas wild rice, which grows in a single stream in Texas, tolerates heat and dryness and could extend the growing range of wild rice. Dicerandra christmanii Found three years ago, this scrub mint grows only in three places in one Florida county. Drought-tolerant and menthol-scented, it is being cultivated. Polygala smallii Tiny polygala, an herb with small yellow-green flowers, grows in open sandy spots in the coastal pinelands of Florida. Only a few individual plants exist.  Stephanomeria malheurensis Malheur wire lettuce became extinct in the wild; it was propagated from saved seeds. Torreya taxifolia Once an abundant tree up to 60 feet tall, the Florida torreya has resinous wood widely used for fence posts. Only seedlings remain in the wild; it is being cultivated.
