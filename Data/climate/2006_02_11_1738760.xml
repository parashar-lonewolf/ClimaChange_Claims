        <p>Editorial supports Fuel Choices for American Security Act of 2005, which would establish goals for fuel savings and provide production incentives for new generation of cars and fuels; holds that bill would have positive spillover effect on global warming because fuel-efficient cars and trucks would produce lower greenhouse gases; says question is whether Congress can focus on big issues without engaging in diversionary fights that every energy bill seems to inspire</p>

        <p>Senator Pete Domenici told a recent gathering of experts that if Congress is going to do anything useful this year about the two big energy-related questions of our time -- oil dependency and global warming -- it will have to focus on ''four or five big things'' instead of the usual laundry list of tax breaks, subsidies and modest research programs.</p>
        <p>A New Mexico Republican who runs the Senate energy committee, Mr. Domenici has become something of a Senate visionary on energy policy.

        <p>Senator Pete Domenici told a recent gathering of experts that if Congress is going to do anything useful this year about the two big energy-related questions of our time -- oil dependency and global warming -- it will have to focus on ''four or five big things'' instead of the usual laundry list of tax breaks, subsidies and modest research programs.</p>
        <p>A New Mexico Republican who runs the Senate energy committee, Mr. Domenici has become something of a Senate visionary on energy policy. With Jeff Bingaman, a New Mexico Democrat, he co-sponsored a resolution that not only accepted the basic science of global warming but also endorsed mandatory controls on emissions of carbon dioxide. The realist in him knows that this Congress is unlikely to take either of the steps (much less both) that would be most likely to lower oil consumption as well as greenhouse gases: a big increase in fuel economy standards and a big gasoline tax.</p>
        <p>But he is willing to entertain other incentives to produce fuel-efficient cars, to develop fuels other than gasoline -- most likely ethanol, not just from corn but from other crops -- and to build a new generation of power plants capable of capturing carbon dioxide before it goes into the atmosphere. Mr. Domenici's vision of the future also includes safer, less expensive nuclear plants, which have the virtue of generating no greenhouse gases.</p>
        <p>There are several legislative vehicles at hand for achieving some of these objectives. One is the Fuel Choices for American Security Act of 2005. There are identical versions in both houses, each with broadly bipartisan sponsorship, including conservatives who would normally resist federal mandates but who believe that reducing oil consumption is an urgent matter of national security.</p>
        <p>The bill would establish a goal for fuel savings of 2.5 million barrels a day (about what we now import from the Persian Gulf), increasing to 7.5 million barrels by 2025. It would also provide some of the means to get there, including serious production incentives for a new generation of cars and fuels.</p>
        <p>Although the bill does not address other imperatives, like cleaner power plants, it would have a positive spillover effect on global warming because fuel-efficient cars and trucks would produce lower greenhouse gases. The question is whether Congress can focus on the big issues without engaging in the diversionary food fights that every energy bill seems to inspire.</p>
        <p>It will be hard for someone not to raise red flags like drilling in the Arctic, or for Congress in general not to indulge its appetite for pork. But with even President Bush signing on (at least in speeches) to the need for a new energy future, this is not the time for business as usual.</p>
