        <p>Hundreds of political scientists and former members of the Clinton administration met at Hofstra University yesterday to debate the legacy of President Bill Clinton, part of a three-day gathering that was part college reunion, part policy powwow and part dogfight.</p>
        <p>They parried and thrust on panels that considered everything from the Middle East peace process to the White House office of correspondence, trade agreements to global warming, old Democrats and new, offering a rough draft of how history books and political science journals might someday treat Mr. Clinton's two terms.</p>
        <p>The sessions also provided a chance for old government hands -- including the former president himself, who appeared on Thursday --to relive the glory days. They gathered in the hallways of Hofstra's student center, pulled each other aside in between panels and sneaked off for quiet lunches wherever they could.</p>
        <p>''It's good to see some old faces,'' said John D. Podesta, Mr. Clinton's last chief of staff, who spoke on a panel about administration staffing.</p>
        <p>But the conference, which began on Thursday, also showed that the years that have passed since Mr. Clinton left office have done little to settle the debates -- about both the president and his policies -- that animated his admirers and his detractors through the 1990's.</p>
        <p>At a panel titled ''Redefining Liberalism,'' two men who were among Mr. Clinton's close advisers, David Gergen and Al From, the chief executive of the Democratic Leadership Council, did their best yesterday to add definition to Mr. Clinton's brand of politics. Mr. From emphasized the president's use of market solutions to advance liberal ends, while Mr. Gergen said that Mr. Clinton's strength was ''not as an innovator'' but as ''a synthesizer.''</p>
        <p>''Clinton was trying to challenge the regnant orthodoxy of his day, which was conservativism,'' Mr. Gergen said. ''He made a valiant effort to redefine the Democratic Party, which did not last.''</p>
        <p>But David Green, a Hofstra political science professor and the lone Clinton critic on the panel, , took a much dimmer view of Mr. Clinton's legacy. Mr. Green, who described himself as more liberal than Mr. Clinton, said, ''The ideology of Bill Clinton was Bill Clinton,'' and added that Mr. Clinton's presidency was ''a fifth-column move to undermine the ideas that I hold dear.''</p>
        <p>Most of the sessions were arranged as a sort of high-minded show and tell, with professors presenting papers at some 50 different panels before former administration officials, journalists and audience members.</p>
        <p>A parade of former high-level Clintonites made its way through the conference during the first two days, from cabinet secretaries (Madeleine Albright, Richard W. Riley and Robert E. Rubin) to chiefs of staff (Thomas F. McLarty and Mr. Podesta) to speechwriters (Michael Waldman and Terry Edmonds, among others).</p>
        <p>''When you've been through that together, you have a tie,'' said Mr. Rubin, who served in Mr. Clinton's administration for six years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rubin, a former Treasury secretary, spoke at a lunch on Thursday attended by Mr. Clinton, who looked on approvingly from the dais as Mr. Rubin praised the Clinton stewardship of fiscal policy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton himself spoke later that day, delivering a speech at Hofstra's athletic arena before several thousand students, faculty members and conferees.</p>
        <p>But many of those attending the conference seemed chiefly concerned with the future, pressing panelists for Clinton-era lessons for the Democratic Party as it struggles to regain power in Washington.</p>
        <p>Stanley Greenberg, a former pollster for Mr. Clinton and an architect of his 1992 campaign message, said that the circumstances that fostered the president's mix of economic populism and appeals to middle-class values had shifted.</p>
        <p>''It was much more possible to merge the material and the spiritual'' during the 1990's, Mr. Greenberg said, when the culture wars seemed to have dissipated and the Sept. 11 attacks had yet to divide the country on issues of national security.</p>
        <p>During another panel, an audience member asked what Mr. Clinton would do if he were again running for president.</p>
        <p>''If he were running again today, he would do exactly what Mrs. Clinton is doing, and run to the center,'' said Shirley Anne Warshaw, a professor of political science at Gettysburg College. Paul Begala, a former political adviser to Mr. Clinton, said at Thursday's session that he thought Americans would re-elect the former president ''in a heartbeat if it wasn't for that pesky 22nd Amendment; he's looking better and better every day.''</p>
        <p>The Clinton conference is the 11th presidential conference that Hofstra has sponsored since 1982, covering every president from Franklin D. Roosevelt forward.</p>
