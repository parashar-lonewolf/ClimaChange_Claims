        <p>It occurred to me, while watching my husband watch underdressed nymphettes stroll by our table on Columbus Avenue, that the story of fashion in the 20th century has been one of attrition. It began with corsets and skirts down to the ankles; it is ending in slit skirts and see-through sweater sets. It's as if the clothing industry no longer believes in its primary reason for being, to cover the body. The beauty industry, in contrast, has gathered strength and confidence with each inch of newly bared skin. Once, its mission was to provide a little powder for the nose. Now it offers firming creams, makeup, glitter and crayons for improving and adorning the body electric.</p>
        <p>These days, the entire epidermis gets the same scrutiny previously reserved for complexions. Hanging at Elizabeth Arden's Red Door Salon on Fifth Avenue is a life-size photo of tall, elegant Amber Valletta scanning her nude back in the mirror. Obviously she has signed up for the full six massage treatments with Arden's Ceramide Firm Lift Body Lotion, which can be used at the salon or at home. If it doesn't turn you into an Amber clone, at least your skin will feel smooth.</p>

        <p>It occurred to me, while watching my husband watch underdressed nymphettes stroll by our table on Columbus Avenue, that the story of fashion in the 20th century has been one of attrition.

        <p>These days, the entire epidermis gets the same scrutiny previously reserved for complexions. Hanging at Elizabeth Arden's Red Door Salon on Fifth Avenue is a life-size photo of tall, elegant Amber Valletta scanning her nude back in the mirror. Obviously she has signed up for the full six massage treatments with Arden's Ceramide Firm Lift Body Lotion, which can be used at the salon or at home. If it doesn't turn you into an Amber clone, at least your skin will feel smooth.</p>
        <p>Christine Valmy offers the Valbreast Collection: spray on the Breast Firming Aromatherapie Oil, then paint on the warmed Hot Ice Mask. Supposedly, the mask cools while vitamins and oils penetrate the skin. Peel off the mask and breasts feel ice cold, like Venus de Milo's.</p>
        <p>Skin left spotty and rough from too much sun can be helped by a variety of acid peels, according to dermatologists. Acid solution is left on for a few minutes and then swabbed off. Afterward skin may flake and crust before the smooth new skin is revealed.</p>
        <p>But even as you buff and polish your hide so you can leave the house in nothing but a slip, you have to wonder what is propelling us toward public nudity. Could this be a result of global warming? Are we as a species subconsciously adjusting to the day when temperate becomes as tropical as the Garden of Eden from which we were expelled for knowing too much? Will mind and body once again be one?</p>
        <p>Certainly, makeup is sweeping downward to embrace the totality. Christian Dior has Hydra-Reflets du Corps, a body moisturizer to use day or night on whatever shows. It gives skin a sheen and, in bright light at close quarters, millions of colored sparkles. In boring situations you can amuse yourself by looking at your own arm. Prescriptives has sticks that add a little color plus shimmer to eyelids, cheeks and body. They're water and transfer resistant, so you don't have to worry about shoulder makeup coming off on your partner when you're involved in a heated tango.</p>
        <p>Face paint is also becoming one with the body. Clinique has a line for summer skewed toward nude, called Double Dipped Colours. Lipstick and eye shadow are two-toned, with a deep shade and a paler shimmer. Blushing Bronze Single is a brush-on tawny pink shimmer for cheeks, temples, shoulders, decolletage and beyond.</p>
        <p>Of course, vast expanses of skin cry out for decoration and adornment, and mehndi, the ancient Indian and North African practice of painting the body with a temporary henna stain, is gaining converts in the West. The Mehndi Project (969-8820) lists many places in New York where you can order up a paint job worthy of a Moroccan bride. As an alternative to henna, Estee Lauder has Waterproof Liquid Eyeliner in six shades that can be used as body paint; stencils are also available. Lancome has a soft Body Crayon in four shades, as well as temporary tattoos that you can color in with crayons or eyeliner. They look almost real and will last through several showers if you don't scrub.</p>
        <p>But in spite of temporary options, many are insisting on genuine tattoos -- pigment deposited by needles under the surface of the skin in a painful process that even laser technology cannot promise to erase completely. Pain and permanence, however, seem to be part of the allure. Perhaps it's a way of finding constancy when the rest of life seems to be running on random. At the tattoo convention at the Roseland Ballroom in mid-May, the air thrummed with the buzz of needles. There was much meeting and greeting and admiring one another's body art. Along with cigarette smoke, a spirit of comradeship drifted through the ballroom. Here was a tribe ideally suited to our nomadic times, wearing its pledge of allegiance burned into the skin.</p>
        <p>Middle-aged men paraded with jackets open, revealing beer bellies transformed into richly decorated canvases. Women proudly displayed less-than-perfect arms and chests disguised by overlays of psychedelic swirls. I noted that these pioneers on the far side of skin art had discovered one solution to the challenge of nudity as the body ages: pile on the tattoos. Personally, I'm waiting for the return of the muumuu.</p>
