        <p>For most people, fast food is as American as french fries. Unfortunately, over time, the oils used to prepare fast food can have the same clogging effects in drain pipes as they do in human arteries.</p>
        <p>But for Bill Hadley, president of Environmental Biotech Inc., a Florida-based franchise network that grows bacteria, grease disposal is just a matter of unleashing microscopic bugs that consume and digest grease.</p>
        <p>The process, known as bioremediation, breaks down the grease into carbon dioxide and water, which is much more safe for the environment.</p>
        <p>Naturally, his franchises' biggest customers are restaurants, among them the Hard Rock Cafe, Wendy's and Burger King. Environmental Biotech, based in Sarasota, has 22 franchise territories in operation. A franchise package costs $29,900.</p>
        <p>Dan Wimpy, a microbiologist who works with the company, has identified more than a dozen natural bacterial strains that love to gorge on grease. Some prefer beef grease while others go for pork grease.</p>
        <p>The company's formula is a mixture of 13 strains; 11 "eat" grease while the two others deal with starch and sugar. The company says its special strains are "trained" to work on the industrial-strength grease used by restaurants. Mr. Hadley said that Mr. Wimpy had been working with the bacteria for seven years, putting them on diets and adapting them to temperature alterations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hadley said the enzymes were injected into the drain lines and grease traps in kitchens. After the bacteria have done their jobs, other substances like disinfectant can kill them. The cleansing process costs about $220.</p>
        <p>"The benefits to the customer are time and money because pipe blockage is very lucrative to plumbers," said Mr. Hadley. Such a measure comes just in time to respond to a new regulation by the Environmental Protection Agency, effective January 1993, which will prohibit the disposal of liquid waste in landfills.</p>
        <p>The current method of clearing blocked pipes requires a plumber to pump out the grease traps, at a cost of about $2,000. They then dump the mess into the regular garbage. Some waste-water treatment plants and solid-waste landfills are already banning the disposal of grease and imposing fines on offenders.</p>
