        <p>The beautiful swirls, tracery and arabesques gracing a collection of radar pictures of Antarctica made public last week would be worthy of exhibition by a gallery of abstract art.</p>
        <p>But more important, they contain clues collected by a Canadian-American satellite that are expected to help in forecasting the fate of low-lying parts of the world, including Bangladesh, the Netherlands and even New York City.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists are keenly interested in Antarctica because of the possibility that some of its gigantic icecap, which contains about 90 percent of the world's ice, could slide into the sea. If just part of the icecap -- the West Antarctic Ice Sheet -- should do this, the global sea level would swiftly rise by about 17 feet, inundating coastal regions everywhere with catastrophic consequences for humanity.</p>
        <p>Now, though, new images from the Canadian-American satellite reveal a mechanism at work in the ice streams of the vastly larger East Antarctic Ice Sheet that might allow it to slide rapidly into the ocean, with potentially serious consequences for mankind.</p>
        <p>Glaciologists do not expect a catastrophe any time soon, nor are they even sure whether Antarctica as a whole is shedding ice at a dangerous rate. But there is evidence that the planet's atmosphere is warming, and that global warming is causing the retreat of glaciers. There is also evidence that the earth has undergone large temperature changes in the past, some of them very abrupt, within a few dozen or a few hundred years.</p>
        <p>Rapid global warming, scientists surmise, could have a dramatic effect on the planet's icecaps, especially the one covering Antarctica.</p>
        <p>Antarctica has been frequently photographed from satellites and aircraft, but in visible light the continent is a largely featureless expanse of glaring white snow covering a thick layer of ice.</p>
        <p>By contrast, radar can penetrate clouds and the snow-covered ice surface to reveal subtle contours and shapes that are otherwise invisible.</p>
        <p>The radar pictures generated from data sent to earth by the Canadian-built Radarsat satellite, which can discern objects only a few meters in size, mark the first time that the entire continent has been imaged in fine enough detail to reveal even buried tracks left by snow tractors four decades ago.</p>
        <p>''Never before have we had a holistic view of the entire continent,'' said Dr. Ghassem Asrar, associate administrator for earth sciences at the Washington headquarters of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. ''Radarsat and other new satellites are opening a new window on Antarctica.''</p>
        <p>The most important discoveries yielded by Radarsat, project officials and scientists say, concern Antarctica's network of ice streams -- immense rivers of ice that channel their way through surrounding ice and rock like toothpaste squeezed from a tube. The new satellite data reveals that these streams travel enormous distances at speeds up to 3,000 feet per year -- 100 times faster than the flow of surrounding ice.</p>
        <p>One network of ice streams that drains the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (due south of South America) carries 19 cubic miles of ice into the sea every year, data from Radarsat showed; this is equivalent to burying Washington, D.C., under 1,700 feet of ice every year.</p>
        <p>Dr. Kenneth C. Jezek, a glaciologist at the Byrd Polar Research Center of Ohio State University, a lead scientist on the Radarsat project, said his group counted about 30 ice streams in the new pictures of the Antarctic continent, many of them previously unknown. Radarsat was able to image these streams by recording their effects on the surface of ice above them -- crevasses, shear bands and other features. Even rocky hills and protuberances lying under a two-mile thickness of ice left subtle traces on the surface ice, which were imaged by Radarsat.</p>
        <p>Among the hidden features imaged by the Radarsat pictures was Lake Vostok -- a liquid-water lake, 140 miles long and 30 miles wide, that lies under the East Antarctic Ice Sheet. The smoothness of the lake's surface is mirrored by a corresponding smoothness of the surface ice two miles above it. Scientists believe that the lake has been sealed off from the outer world for a million years and may contain organisms very different from any found elsewhere. But before punching a drill through the ice into the lake, scientists are seeking a sure way of preventing contaminants from entering the lake along with the drill.</p>
        <p>''One of the biggest surprises,'' Dr. Jezek said in an interview, ''was that ice streams flowing through the East Antarctic ice sheet extend for great distances into the very center of the continent -- in some cases, more than 500 miles from the coast.</p>
        <p>''This means that East Antarctica, like West Antarctica, seems to have a mechanism for rapidly moving ice from the interior to the coastal sea.''</p>
        <p>This is potentially bad news. Previously, scientists had believed that the East Antarctic Ice Sheet was locked into place atop the continent's bed rock, incapable of rapid shifts of ice toward the sea.</p>
        <p>Antarctica's ice streams are believed to be propelled by two mechanisms.</p>
        <p>In the case of West Antarctica, the dominant mechanism is thought to be the removal of frictional stress by lubrication of the ice sliding seaward over bed rock. Geothermal and volcanic heating as well as atmospheric warming apparently maintain a layer of liquid water and mud between the ice sheet and underlying rock, allowing the ice to slide fairly freely.</p>
        <p>The other mechanism, which may be important for the transport of ice from East Antarctica, is ''glaciological static head pressure'' -- pressure exerted by the steeply sloping two-mile thickness of ice covering East Antarctica. Evenly distributed over the region this pressure would cause only slow movement, but if ice is being channeled into fast streams, as now appears to be the case, the transport of ice could be much more rapid, Dr. Jezek said.</p>
        <p>But the behavior of ice streams and the coastal ice shelves into which they flow is complex and unpredictable. The Fimbul Ice Shelf (along the Princess Martha Coast) is retreating in some places and advancing in others, Dr. Jezek said. The Fimbul Ice Shelf interests glaciologists because it is at about the same latitude as ice shelves along the Antarctic Peninsula, which are clearly retreating. Because the Fimbul shows no such trend, the waxing and waning of glaciers seems to depend on other factors besides latitude.</p>
        <p>''There are mixed signals almost everywhere you turn, with little consistent pattern. That's why it's important to measure ice movement in many different places at different times, to gauge overall effects,'' Dr. Jezek said.</p>
        <p>Planning for Radarsat began in 1980 and took many years to reach fruition. Canada was interested in building a high-resolution radar satellite mainly to monitor shipping channels in the high Arctic.</p>
        <p>After years of negotiation between NASA and the Canadian Space Agency, NASA agreed to launch the satellite and provide software and data analysis in exchange for access to some of the data produced by the satellite.</p>
        <p>Also, American officials insisted that the satellite make at least two imaging scans of Antarctica.</p>
        <p>Finally, on Nov. 4, 1995, Radarsat was launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base, in California, into a polar orbit 500 miles high, and began scanning the earth. But it was not until 1997 that Canadian controllers completed a difficult rotation of the satellite putting Antarctica into full view. Then, during 18 days in September and October of that year, Radarsat carried out its monumental scan of the white continent.</p>
        <p>But acquisition of the data gathered by Radarsat took time, and the Vexel Corporation of Boulder, Colo., needed time to develop the software needed to generate a mosaic of the entire continent from many small images made from different angles and orientations of the satellite.</p>
        <p>Some of the spectacular pictures extracted from data processed during the last two years by the Byrd Polar Research Center -- the fruits of the $600 million Radarsat project -- were released last week by NASA and the Canadian Space Agency.</p>
        <p>One of the techniques used to determine the speeds and directions of ice flow was interferometry, in which separate images of the same subject were made by Radarsat on two different dates: Sept. 24 and Oct. 18, 1997. By comparing the two views mathematically, a computer program calculated the velocity and direction of ice streams at every point in their courses through surrounding ice.</p>
        <p>'It's this kind of fine detail we need to estimate overall changes in the ice mass of the continent and to be able to make predictions,'' Dr. Asrar of NASA said. ''We've made a start.''</p>
