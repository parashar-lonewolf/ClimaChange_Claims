        <p>The study, by Dr. Thomas J.

        <p>A new analysis of the climate of the last 1,000 years suggests that human activity is the dominant force behind the sharp global warming trend seen in the 20th century.</p>
        <p>The study, by Dr. Thomas J. Crowley, a geologist at Texas A&amp;M University, found that natural factors, like fluctuations in sunshine or volcanic activity, were powerful influences on temperatures in past centuries. But he found that they accounted for only 25 percent of the warming since 1900. The lion's share, he said, can be attributed to human influences, particularly to rising levels of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping ''greenhouse gases'' that come from the burning of fuels and forests.</p>
        <p>''These twin lines of evidence provide further support for the idea that the greenhouse effect is already here,'' Dr. Crowley wrote in describing the work in today's issue of the journal Science. Several climate experts said his findings offered the most direct link yet between people and the 1.1 degree rise in average global temperature over the last 100 years.</p>
        <p>The study has already caused debate among camps of scientists who dispute the climate records used in Dr. Crowley's analysis and others who say the oceans play an underappreciated role in controlling warming and cooling of the planet.</p>
        <p>But many climatologists said it marked a substantial move forward in understanding forces that have warmed the earth and are likely to continue warming it.</p>
        <p>Resolving this puzzle -- the balance between human and natural influences -- has been something of a holy grail in atmospheric science, particularly because the answer could determine whether countries enact plans in coming years to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, many scientists said that Dr. Crowley's work, while not definitive, was helping build a strong case.</p>
        <p>''This seems to reinforce the notion that we're into a new mode beyond simple natural forcing, that something else is taking place,'' said Dr. Raymond S. Bradley, the director of the Climate System Research Center at the University of Massachusetts.</p>
        <p>''The logical conclusion is there is some role played'' by human affairs, added Dr. Bradley, whose studies of past climates were one of the yardsticks used to measure the reliability of the new work.</p>
        <p>There has been a slow shift toward this conclusion in the last few years. In April, for example, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the international group whose work has largely shaped the debate on the issue for a decade, circulated a draft of its next report on global warming, saying ''there has been a discernable human influence on global climate.''</p>
        <p>Scientists said the main value Dr. Crowley's study was his specific description of the limited role of natural forces in recent decades.</p>
        <p>In a separate commentary, also published in Science, Michael E. Mann, a climate expert at the University of Virginia and a research partner with Dr. Bradley, said the new work also indirectly confirms that computer models that predict a continuation of the warming in coming decades are reasonably reliable.</p>
        <p>The news cheered environmental officials at the White House who have backed action to control greenhouse gas emissions, particularly because diplomats will meet again this fall to debate ways to put into practice the provisions of the Kyoto Protocol, a 1997 agreement outlining a plan to cut such emissions.</p>
        <p>Dr. Neal Lane, a physicist who is the presidential science adviser, said in an interview that it was important not to overplay the study, which relied on a fairly simple computer model and estimated variations in the sun's power that were, at best, rough approximations.</p>
        <p>But the new study largely correlates with work by Dr. Mann and others that used different methods but reached similar conclusions.</p>
        <p>''Scientists will debate whether this is the smoking gun,'' Dr. Lane said. ''But it's clear that the changes we've seen in this century are unprecedented in the last thousand years. This argues for prudent action to stem the growth of greenhouse gases.''</p>
        <p>Critics of the global warming theory quickly took note of the work, but mainly to poke at its weaknesses. For example, Dr. S. Fred Singer, the president of Science &amp; Environmental Policy Project, a private consulting group in Virginia, said Dr. Crowley had drawn precise conclusions from imprecise calculations.</p>
        <p>But other scientists defended Dr. Crowley's approach.</p>
        <p>The initial goal in the work, Dr. Crowley said, was to gain a better understanding of how natural influences were shaping past global temperatures, which have included a variety of shifts ranging from a medieval warming to a prolonged cooling from the 1600's to the 1800's that is called the Little Ice Age.</p>
        <p>Two of the most important factors are changes in the radiation flowing from the sun, which is thought to follow many complex cycles, and volcanoes, which temporarily cool the earth by lofting a veil of fine sulfate droplets that reflect sunlight.</p>
        <p>Dr. Crowley found that past variations in the radiance of the sun or bursts of volcanic activity, when fed into a computer model simulating the flow of energy to and from the earth, produced temperatures that match most of the ups and downs of the actual climate from the year 1000 to the mid 1800's.</p>
        <p>But that neat relationship among sunlight, eruptions and temperature broke down completely in the 20th century, he reported. The only ''forcing'' that remotely matched the jump in temperatures seen in the latter half of the century was the rise in emissions of greenhouse gases.</p>
        <p>Dr. Crowley himself noted that his model was rough; for example, he said, past solar variation is only indirectly recorded, partly in traces of elements found in old glacial ice that were made as radiation from the sun and other stars bombarded the atmosphere and partly in observations by Galileo and subsequent astronomers who charted sunspot activity from 1610 on.</p>
        <p>Even so, the good correlation between his work and other recent reconstructions of past climates prompted a variety of climate experts to say the study was valid. a big step forward.</p>
        <p>A separate study, to be published tomorrow in Geophysical Research Letters, an influential journal, largely echoes Dr. Crowley's assertion that human actions are dominating current climate shifts. But the second study cautions that other, natural factors could stall further warming.</p>
        <p>One of the authors of that report, Dr. Michael E. Schlesinger, a climatologist at the University of Illinois, said it was particularly important for policy makers and the public not to assume that temperature trends would follow a smooth course.</p>
        <p>He said the relationship between the oceans and the atmosphere was so complex that alterations in it could easily cause temporary cool periods or other unpredictable -- and possibly abrupt -- changes that could create confusion and paralyze work to attack global warming.</p>
