        <p>LEAD: Donald T. Regan, the former White House chief of staff, testified today that he ''hit the overhead'' when he learned that he had failed twice in 1985 to have the visit of a middle-level South Korean trade official struck from President Reagan's appointment schedule.</p>
        <p>Donald T. Regan, the former White House chief of staff, testified today that he ''hit the overhead'' when he learned that he had failed twice in 1985 to have the visit of a middle-level South Korean trade official struck from President Reagan's appointment schedule.</p>
        <p>His testimony came at the perjury trial of Michael K. Deaver, who was instrumental in gaining the visit for the Korean official, witnesses have said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Regan, who kept tight control over the President's visitors, was not asked whether he knew then that the visit of the official, Kim Ki-Hwan, was being sought by Mr. Deaver, who became a $475,000-a-year consultant to the South Korean Government after leaving the White House as deputy chief of staff in May 1985. Pressure Cited on Appointment</p>
        <p>Also, in a statement that apparently surprised Mr. Deaver's lawyers, Mr. Regan testified that Mr. Deaver had pressured the White House into appointing Drew Lewis, a former Secretary of Transportation, as a special envoy to Canada. The statement contradicted Mr. Deaver's sworn testimony earlier before a Congressional subcommittee.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lewis was appointed to help resolve a dispute with Canada over acid rain.</p>
        <p>Mr. Deaver has been accused of lying before a House subcommittee and a grand jury that were investigating his lobbying efforts in behalf of South Korea, Canada and other clients after he left the White House.</p>
        <p>Federal law forbids senior Government officials from lobbying former associates on matters in which they were officially involved for at least a year after leaving the Government.</p>
        <p>Mr. Regan said that a week or more before the visit of Mr. Kim, which had been scheduled for Oct. 2, 1985, he had had ordered an aide to ''take it off'' the President's schedule.</p>
        <p>But under questioning today by Whitney North Seymour Jr., the independent prosecutor in the case, Mr. Regan said that ''to my astonishment, several days later the name was still there'' on a revised Presidential schedule. 'It Was Still There'</p>
        <p>''I was told the National Security Council wanted it,'' he said. ''I said, 'I don't give a damn, get it off.' ''</p>
        <p>But 24 hours later, he said, ''It was still there.''</p>
        <p>Using the nautical language of a former marine, Mr. Regan said, ''I hit the overhead on that.''</p>
        <p>He said he was told that Rear Adm. John M. Poindexter, then the deputy director of the National Security Council, believed Mr. Kim's visit was ''of utmost importance'' and would speak to him about it on Oct. 1.</p>
        <p>Mr. Regan testified that Admiral Poindexter told him that Mr. Kim was ''bringing a very important letter'' to President Reagan from Chun Doo Hwan, the President of South Korea, and that ''it was important for diplomatic relations, as well as 'face,' for him not to be bounced off the schedule.''</p>
        <p>''I said, 'I can't see it, we're setting a terrible precedent,' '' Mr. Regan said. He said he warned that ''every low-level visitor'' would have to be admitted to the Oval Office.</p>
        <p>But although he said it was ''not a customary procedure,'' he finally agreed, saying, ''O.K., but it's on N.S.C. time.''</p>
        <p>That was a reference to the fact that the National Security Council staff had a daily meeting with the President. Mr. Regan was ruling that Mr. Kim would have to be wedged into the security council schedule. #2-Minute Visit With President Earier testimony in the trial showed that Mr. Kim was admitted to the Oval Office for two minutes on Oct. 2, 1985, after Mr. Deaver, who had left the Administration five months earlier, learned that the visit was being blocked by the White House staff and telephoned Admiral Poindexter to inquire about its status.</p>
        <p>In testimony last month, Admiral Poindexter said that Mr. Deaver had telephoned him about Mr. Kim on the night of Oct. 1, 1985. The admiral said he had ordered his staff to ''check up on it,'' and Mr. Kim's name was penciled back into the President's schedule.</p>
        <p>Herbert J. Miller Jr., Mr. Deaver's chief defense counsel, had asked Admiral Poindexter whether Mr. Deaver had tried to ''influence you or coerce you in any way.''</p>
        <p>''No way,'' the witness replied. ''No, he did not.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Regan, whose departure from the White House staff last February was arranged in part by Mr. Deaver, a close friend of President and Nancy Reagan, was the 25th prosecution witness.</p>
        <p>Earlier today, Robert C. McFarlane, who preceded Admiral Poindexter as director of the National Security Council, completed his testimony, which began Monday.</p>
        <p>Mr. McFarlane, Mr. Regan and a third witness, Richard Hauser, a former deputy counsel to the President, said there was occasional concern in the White House over the propriety of Mr. Deaver's role as a lobbyist.</p>
