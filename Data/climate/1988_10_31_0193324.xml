        <p>The United States Senate race in New Jersey has been among the most hard-fought and bitter in the country. Yet when addressing specific issues, the Democratic incumbent, Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, and his Republican challenger, Pete Dawkins, do not differ dramatically. For example, both want the Federal Government to spend more on the environment, on anti-drug programs and on day care. Both are concerned about the size of the deficit. Neither favors increased taxes to pay for new government programs or to offset the deficit, although Mr. Dawkins alone pledges not to vote for tax hikes. On some issues, abortion for example, Mr. Dawkins takes a moderate rather than a conservative position. Similarly, on such issues as gun control, Mr. Lautenberg takes a moderate rather than a liberal position. The two men were interviewed by Clifford D. May of The New York Times. What follows is a distillation of their positions on issues facing New Jersey and the nation.  Frank R. Lautenberg: Federal deficit - Sees the deficit as a problem of ''major magnitude.'' Opposes the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit reduction law because ''we don't need to go on automatic pilot.''</p>
        <p>Would trim defense spending, sell off some Federal assets and reduce agricultural price-subsidy programs, particularly those benefiting large corporate -rather than family - farms.</p>
        <p>Pete Dawkins: Federal deficit - Views the deficit as a ''big problem'' but not a ''mushrooming problem that is overwhelming us, as the liberal Democrats argue.'' Opposes the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit reduction law because it cuts all programs equally. Would reduce agricultural price supports and sell off some Federal assets such as Dulles and National Airports.</p>
        <p>Frank R. Lautenberg: Taxes - Calls increased taxes, particularly increased income taxes, ''a last resort.''</p>
        <p>Favors cuts in spending first, then selected tax increases, on tobacco for example, as well as making companies that pollute contribute more toward environmental cleanup.</p>
        <p>Pete Dawkins: Taxes - Opposes any new taxes. Argues that economic growth increases Federal revenues and that any policy that hinders growth - such as raising taxes - is bound to be self-defeating.</p>
        <p>Frank R. Lautenberg: Trade - Believes sanctions may be necessary against countries that refuse to allow American companies fair and equal access to their markets. Less concerned about the possibility of trade wars than about the job losses and domestic economic impact if trading partners continue to restrain the sale of American products.</p>
        <p>Pete Dawkins: Trade - Opposes tariff barriers because ''that can lead to international trade wars.''</p>
        <p>Prefers the use of incentives and ''ingenuity'' rather than sanctions as a means of combating discrimination against American products in Japan and other countries.</p>
        <p>Frank R. Lautenberg: Defense spending - Believes the defense budget can be trimmed without jeopardizing security. Supports some research on the Strategic Defense Initiative but not its deployment.</p>
        <p>Wants America's allies to contribute more toward their own defense. Believes that Japan, for example, should more than double the percent of its gross national product spent on defense.</p>
        <p>Pete Dawkins: Defense spending - Supports current spending levels but believes ''we can find ways to get more out of our defense dollars.'' Favors research and development of the Strategic Defense Initiative, arguing that it would be ''irresponsible not to proceed since the Soviets are going pell-mell to develop theirs.'' Wants America's allies to contribute more toward their own defense.</p>
        <p>Japan, in particular, should increase defense spending ''from 1 to 2 percent of their G.N.P.''  Frank R. Lautenberg: Drugs - Opposes decriminalization. Wants to spend more on treatment and education but also calls for being ''tough on enforcement'' against both sellers and users.</p>
        <p>Does not favor the death penalty for drug dealers who commit murder or believe that the death penalty acts as an effective deterrent. However, voted for the recently passed drug bill that contained a death penalty provision.</p>
        <p>Pete Dawkins: Drugs - Opposes decriminalization. Wants to fight the problem of drug use and abuse on ''multiple fronts, supply and demand.''</p>
        <p>Favors the death penalty for drug dealers who commit murder, ''which I do see as a deterrent to drug dealers.'' Favors increased penalties for users and increased spending on education and treatment. Calls for neighborhood ''drug hospices'' as a less expensive and more efficient alternative to treatment in hospitals.</p>
        <p>Frank R. Lautenberg: Environment - Sees ocean cleanup as ''still an enormous problem.'' Concerned about acid rain but believes that a consensus for significant new legislation is finally emerging in Congress. Also seeks more attention for air pollution, radon, toxic wastes and sewage treatment.</p>
        <p>Pete Dawkins: Environment - Considers pollution of the ocean and shore ''the No. 1 immediate crisis.''</p>
        <p>Favors greatly increased research and development on waste disposal methods. Says that more attention also needs to be given to radon, clean air and toxic-waste cleanup.</p>
        <p>Frank R. Lautenberg: Middle East - Opposes recognition of the Palestine Liberation Organization unless and until it acknowledges Israel's right to exist.</p>
        <p>Sees a need for continuing American involvement in any process toward a settlement and does not view a Soviet role as necessary or helpful. Opposes re-establishment of diplomatic relations with Iran until that country has undergone a change of regime and policies.</p>
        <p>Pete Dawkins: Middle East - Opposes recognition of the Palestine Liberation Organization unless and until it acknowledges Israel's right to exist.</p>
        <p>Sees a need for continuing American involvement in any process toward a settlement and does not view a Soviet role as necessary or helpful.</p>
        <p>Opposes re-establishment of diplomatic relations with Iran until that country undegoes a change of regime and policies.</p>
        <p>Frank R. Lautenberg: Central America - Opposed to military aid to the contra rebels in Nicaragua but would continue to provide humanitarian aid. Believes diplomatic pressure combined with incentives can prod the Sandinista Government toward greater democratization.</p>
        <p>Pete Dawkins: Central America - Supports military aid to the contra rebels in Nicaragua. Hopes to ''build a coalition among Latin American governments to bring collective pressure'' to bear on the Nicaraguan Government to democratize.</p>
        <p>Frank R. Lautenberg: Gun control - Supports a national law mandating a seven-day waiting period before the purchase of a handgun.</p>
        <p>''We have that in New Jersey and it's a good law. It gives the cops time to check the guy out. But you can go over to Delaware where there is no waiting period or to Pennsylvania where it's two days.</p>
        <p>That's not good enough.''  Pete Dawkins: Gun control - Supports the seven-day waiting period currently called for under New Jersey law but opposes any expansion of that rule to a national level, arguing that each state should do as it sees fit.</p>
        <p>Frank R. Lautenberg: Abortion - Supports Medicaid funding for abortions.</p>
        <p>''It's got to be the choice of the woman, her doctor and her conscience.''  Pete Dawkins: Abortion - Opposes abortion but does not favor a constitutional amendment banning the practice.</p>
        <p>''This is an issue that should be left up to the states. State legislatures have a history of dealing with these issues.''  Frank R. Lautenberg: Capital punishment - Opposes the death penalty in the belief that it does not act as a deterrent and that lives taken by the state in error cannot be restored. Instead, supports life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for those convicted of serious crimes.</p>
        <p>Pete Dawkins: Capital punishment - Favors the death penalty for anyone convicted of killing a police officer, for drug dealers who commit murder, for Presidential assassins and others who have committed ''especially heinous crimes.''  Frank R. Lautenberg: Affirmative action - Supports enrollment and employment programs that take race into account ''but would like it not to be so strict as to have set quotas.''  Pete Dawkins: Affirmative action - Opposes discrimination but does not support the use of quotas.</p>
