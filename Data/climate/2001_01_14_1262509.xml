        <p>Foreign policy has not played a decisive role in electing a president since 1968, the height of the Vietnam War. And since 1992, when Bill Clinton recognized that the end of the cold war made George Bush's victory in the Persian Gulf very nearly irrelevant as a political asset, foreign policy has become an electoral afterthought. In this past campaign, Al Gore and George W.

        <p>Perhaps we should feel grateful that foreign policy has lost its political prominence. The sense of menace that once made the world matter urgently to us has subsided with the end of the cold war. But if today's world is less dangerous, it is also more complex. Just think of the foreign engagements that virtually forced themselves on President Clinton: two military interventions, in Bosnia and in Kosovo, and two economic ones, in Mexico and in Asia. The first pair involved the new phenomenon of disintegrating states, the second the new phenomenon of economic globalization. Forces both smaller and larger than the state now play a crucial role in foreign affairs. And as the terrain has changed, so have the terms of the debate. During the cold war, there was one axis and two poles -- hard or soft on Communism. But it's no longer obvious what it means to be ''liberal'' or ''conservative'' on foreign policy. Does it mean anything at all?</p>
        <p>At the outset of that second debate, Jim Lehrer asked each candidate about his ''guiding principles'' for the exercise of America's extraordinary power in the world. George Bush said, ''The first question is what's in the best interests of the United States.'' Al Gore then pointedly said, ''I see it as a question of values.'' But Gore's subsequent attempts to appear affable blurred the very real philosophical disagreement between the two men. Bush made it plain that he would be far more reluctant than Gore to use the military to prevent mass killing abroad and to promote ''nation building''; he even said, in language that would have sounded distinctly ''left'' during the cold war, that ''one way for us to end up being viewed as the ugly American is for us to go around the world saying, 'We do it this way, so should you.' ''Gore, on the other hand, insisted that acting according to our values is profoundly in the national interest.</p>
        <p>The self-conscious use of the words ''interest'' and ''values'' points to one way in which the foreign-policy debate has realigned itself since the end of the cold war. The words correspond roughly to the realism of traditional European diplomacy and to the idealism associated, for good and for ill, with Woodrow Wilson. And although the Gore side would not have accepted the Wilsonian label, the Bush team was eager to don the mantle of realism. In fact, Condoleezza Rice, Bush's principal foreign policy adviser during the campaign and soon to be his national security adviser, expressed this distinction with great clarity last year in an article in the journal Foreign Affairs. When foreign policy is centered on values, she explained, ''the 'national interest' is replaced with 'humanitarian interests' or the interests of 'the international community.' The belief that the United States is exercising power legitimately only when it is doing so on behalf of someone or something else was deeply rooted in Wilsonian thought, and there are strong echoes of it in the Clinton administration. To be sure, there is nothing wrong with doing something that benefits all humanity, but that is, in a sense, a second-order effect.'' There is an unsettling coldbloodedness in that ''second-order effect,'' though it doesn't read as if Rice is trying to shock. She simply does not believe in humanitarianism as a goal of foreign policy.</p>
        <p>''Realism'' may sound like nothing more than an honest assessment of a dangerous world, but it is important to understand how far this stands outside the American tradition. In his recent book, ''Diplomacy,'' Henry Kissinger writes that from Woodrow Wilson to George Bush, ''American presidents have invoked their country's unselfishness as the crucial attribute of its leadership role.'' Wilsonian idealism was so deeply in the American grain that party affiliation scarcely mattered: with his imagery of a ''shining city on a hill'' versus ''an evil empire,'' and with his interventions all over the globe, Ronald Reagan was Wilson's most unabashed follower. George Bush the elder toned down the evangelism, but his foreign policy was grounded in Wilson's language of mutuality and cooperation -- above all in creating the coalition that waged the gulf war.</p>
        <p>What is striking about George W. Bush and his inner circle is not how different they sound from Bill Clinton but how different they sound from the first President Bush. The New World Order is as distant a memory as the evil empire. Helping humanity is suddenly a second-order effect. As Rice put it sardonically in an interview last fall, ''We don't need to have the 82nd Airborne escorting kids to kindergarten'' in Bosnia and Kosovo. And it isn't only the moralism, but also the mutuality, that has become passe. Most of Bush's top advisers oppose the principal international compacts that our allies have adopted in recent years: the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty; the Kyoto Protocol on global warming; the International Criminal Court. What one feels, in talking to the people who are likely to determine foreign policy in the Bush administration, is a worldly pragmatism but also a preoccupation with threat, a suspiciousness about negotiations, a willingness to go it alone.</p>
        <p>It's no coincidence that the central theme of the new administration's military policy will be national missile defense, which holds out the tantalizing promise of instant security in an inherently insecure world. This defensive posture, combined with a willingness to withdraw from the global community, leads a former high-ranking official in the Clinton State Department to describe a probable Bush foreign policy as ''a strange mix of timidity and arrogance.'' Even Kissinger, a realist himself, might wonder whether so narrowly drawn and unsentimental a policy could inspire the American people. Perhaps the most hopeful thing one can say is that administrations rarely stick to the abstract principles they lay out during the campaign.</p>
        <p>It is precisely because we no longer live in a status-quo world that George W. Bush will be subjected to a question that must irk him and certainly infuriates the people around him: ''Does he get it?'' The president-elect really does know a lot about education, and about faith-based initiatives, and no doubt about some other domestic issues as well. But pretty much everything that he knows about the world beyond our borders, with the exception of Mexico, he has picked up from bull sessions with Condoleezza Rice and the band of advisers she assembled in 1999. The advisers say that Bush proved to be a diligent student, but you have to wonder about even that. When an interviewer asked him about the Taliban during the campaign, Bush drew a blank. Only when given a hint -- repression of women in Afghanistan'' -- did Bush say, ''Oh. I thought you said some band. The Taliban in Afghanistan! Absolutely. Repressive.''</p>
        <p>Critics often describe Bush as ''incurious'' about the world, but that word hardly does justice to what feels almost like a principled provincialism. Here was someone who by age 13 was mingling in the country-club set of Houston, who then went on to Andover, Yale and Harvard Business School -- and did so in the age of cut-rate international air fares -- and yet he rarely traveled abroad. Bush was in his mid-20's when his father became ambassador to the United Nations, and still he stayed home. He must have had to resist actively his parents' blandishments. He visited China in 1975, when his father was U.S. liaison; Gambia, at President Bush's behest, in 1990; and the Middle East in 1998, when he had begun thinking about his own run for the presidency. (He also traveled to Europe several times in the 90's with the Young Presidents' Organization, a group for corporate executives.)</p>
        <p>People close to Bush dismiss his past as irrelevant; he has, they say, both the experience and the character to direct the affairs of the free world. Condoleezza Rice argues that as governor of Texas, Bush gained a familiarity with foreign affairs from his dealings with Mexico. ''He has on-the-ground experience there,'' she says, ''which I would say is much more valuable than if he had been attending seminars at the Council on Foreign Relations for the last five years.'' Rice also turns the insularity argument on its head, arguing that the president-elect ''comes at this as an American with very, very American values.'' These arguments seem reassuring mostly to Bush's own allies. Many Europeans, for example, see the president-elect as an all-American boob. Olivier Duhamel, a respected and usually restrained French commentator on foreign affairs, described Bush in Le Monde as a symbol of the ''cretinisation'' of American politics.</p>
        <p>The core issue is not whether Bush is smart enough to grasp the nuances of a complex world -- he has smart advisers for that -- but whether he cares enough. His party is led by figures, from Trent Lott to Tom DeLay, who view much of the foreign world with outright suspicion. Brent Scowcroft, Bush the elder's national security adviser, describes a ''mood change'' in Congress since his time in office toward a view that is ''much more conservative, much more hostile to multilateralism.'' Will Bush speak unambiguously to these figures, and to the public, about the virtues of active diplomacy? It doesn't seem very likely.</p>
        <p>Of course, Bush's capacities wouldn't matter terribly much if he chooses to function as a figurehead in foreign affairs. Talking to diplomats and foreign-policy scholars both here and abroad, the same refrain occurs again and again: thank God he'll have the father nearby - or Dick Cheney, or Colin Powell, or the advisers who told him what to say during the campaign. In fact, Bush will clearly be turning to his father for advice, as he always has, though one family friend says that Poppy will offer his counsel only if W. specifically asks for it. Vice President-elect Cheney is almost certain to play an important role in defense issues, especially since his former mentor, Donald Rumsfeld, has been nominated to head the Pentagon; but Cheney may be too preoccupied with Congress to play a major role in formulating foreign policy.</p>
        <p>If there is to be a regent in foreign affairs, it will thus be Colin Powell, Bush's nominee for secretary of state. It is, in fact, hard to overstate the power that comes with Powell's stratospheric, almost absurd, standing with the American public. It is as if he had done the new administration a favor by joining it. Dov Zakheim, a Defense Department official in the Reagan administration and one of Bush's foreign policy advisers during the campaign, says, ''Any doubts about the coherence or vision of a Bush foreign policy will immediately dissipate'' when Powell takes office. That's hyperbolic, but it is true that the same Europeans, and for that matter the same Democrats, who ridicule Bush speak respectfully of Powell, even when they disagree with his views.</p>
        <p>At the same time, it's not altogether obvious why that's so. Powell is a career military man -- he also served briefly as Reagan's national security adviser -- who until now has needed to understand the world as soldiers do. He may well be deeply versed in world affairs, though it would be hard to say on the strength of the 45-minute off-the-record telephone conversation that I was permitted to have with him and Rice. Powell was measured, soft-spoken, deferential and somewhat prone to lofty sentiments of the after-dinner-speaker variety, while Rice fired off a steady ack-ack of particulars. Indeed, it may be Powell's diplomatic temperament, rather than the acuity of his views, that accounts for the emollient effect he has on critics. And yet, thanks to his standing in the world -- and Bush's lack of it -- Powell will be able to operate with tremendous latitude, if he wishes. It's not easy to see how Bush could fire him or perhaps even overrule him. Powell could well turn out to be the most powerful secretary of state since Kissinger.</p>
        <p>If Powell will be the Bush administration's Mr. Outside, Condoleezza Rice, as national security adviser, will be Ms. Inside. A former official on the Security Council in the Bush administration, she met W. in 1995, and the two bonded when Rice talked baseball. Bush quickly found that he was comfortable asking her the most elementary questions. Rice is crisp, knowledgeable, self-assured and quite possibly bionic. She has spoken in the past of having no time for a wide range of otherwise normal human activities, including recreation, family, introspection, ''life crises.'' While Powell will almost certainly be the key figure in the formulation of policy, Rice seems likely to wield a whip hand inside the National Security Council. It was Rice who insisted that she and Powell would speak to me only by conference call; and after we had our conversation, she e-mailed colleagues informing them that they need not -- meaning, ought not -- talk to me, though several did so.</p>
        <p>Rice assembled Bush's team of foreign-policy advisers for the campaign, passing over moderate Republicans in favor of what Robert Gallucci, the dean of the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University, describes as ''intelligent hard-liners.'' Rice is an intelligent hard-liner herself. There's a delicious twist in the fact that her mentor at the University of Denver, where she earned her doctorate, was Josef Korbel, the father of Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright. Albright's flights of moral passion, her description of the United States as the ''indispensable nation'' and her eagerness to use the military for humanitarian purposes appear to Rice and her colleagues as the very text of reckless Wilsonianism.</p>
        <p>On many issues, a bush administration will probably not behave very differently from its predecessor, campaign rhetoric notwithstanding. True, it will not publicly lecture our less democratic allies in Asia about their human rights violations, as the Clinton administration was wont to do, and it will expect the Russians to reform their economy without so much international help; but these are differences in emphasis, not in kind. Bush's advisers insist that they will isolate Iraq and keep it from making weapons of mass destruction, but some of them concede that it is easier to criticize the current policy than to come up with a workable alternative. As for our policy toward Israel, the main difference may be who's involved in negotiations. George Bush is not going to be pulling all-nighters going over maps of the West Bank. Any peace brokering will be handled by Colin Powell. As Dov Zakheim puts it, ''One of the biggest shortcomings in the way we've handled the Middle East is that the president was his own secretary of state.''</p>
        <p>Overall, a Bush administration is likely to have the kind of foreign policy the corporate community likes -- less focus on human rights, more on free trade. Bush will be meeting with Prime Minister Jean Chretien of Canada as well as with various Latin American leaders at the Summit of the Americas in April. A principal topic on the agenda will be removing barriers to trade. As one of Bush's advisers says, ''Clinton and Gore understood the benefits of open markets, but they had a real political constituency problem'' -- labor and environmental groups that insisted on trade restrictions. Bush will be able to unambiguously extol free markets, as he will again with the Chinese at an Asia-Pacific regional meeting next fall. At the same time, ''free markets,'' like ''strong defense,'' is a shibboleth, not a policy. Europeans take a far more restrictive view than Americans do on, for example, the marketing of personal information, or the sale of genetically modified food; these will be among the difficult trade issues of the future.</p>
        <p>But the great difference between Bush and Clinton will most likely have to do with military and defense policy. Bush and the people around him believe ardently that only by constructing a national missile defense, or N.M.D., can the United States offer security in a world where not only Saddam Hussein but Osama bin Laden may gain access to weapons of mass destruction. Security in such a world may in fact be a fantasy; the Pentagon has suffered one embarrassing setback after another as it has tried to create a functioning missile-defense system. But Bush's advisers argue that the Clinton administration made only a halfhearted commitment to developing N.M.D. However, the political problems with missile defense may prove even more intractable than the technical ones. N.M.D. would require a major rewriting of the 1972 ABM treaty with the Russians. Vladimir Putin, the president of Russia, has gone around the world organizing opposition to the N.M.D. plan and has enjoyed a great deal of success. I called half a dozen foreign-policy figures in Europe and Canada without finding a single one who thought it would enhance security.</p>
        <p>Bush's advisers say they believe that Clinton made no attempt to mollify the Russians or persuade the Europeans on N.M.D. During the campaign, Bush said he would consider making major unilateral cuts to our stock of offensive missiles, in the hope of making it clear to the Russians that N.M.D. is not designed to win a nuclear chess game with them but is rather in our mutual interest. He also stated that the missile-defense umbrella would cover our allies as well as ourselves. However, few Europeans worry about rogue missiles nearly as much as about the threat of an angry Russia, and the Russians -- as well as the Chinese -- may well feel that they can get far more mileage out of depicting the United States as a global aggressor than out of acquiescing to Bush's terms.</p>
        <p>So what happens if the Russians refuse to rewrite the ABM treaty? The Bush team will unilaterally abrogate it. Our allies would accept the inevitable, with greater or lesser grace. But public opinion throughout the West would almost certainly be inflamed. And we would have confirmed some of the darkest fears of our allies. Dominique Moisi, a French foreign-policy commentator, says: ''There is a feeling that there will be some kind of uncoupling between the American destiny and the European destiny. For a Republican administration, the United States is the only global actor on the world screen; they accept Europe, but as a regional actor.'' Moisi says that he expects ''more arrogance and more unilateralism.''</p>
        <p>And that arrogance and unilateralism are what, at bottom, our allies fear most. The doctrine of national interests offers a permanent rationale for going your own way -- no matter what the world says. Condoleezza Rice has written that it is not ''isolationist to suggest that the United States has a special role in the world and should not adhere to every international convention and agreement that someone thinks to propose.'' It may not be, but ordinary citizens in much of Europe and Canada, as well as many diplomats and statesmen, are quite committed to peacekeeping and nation-building and war-crimes tribunals and indeed the entire moral panoply that Rice and others speak of dismissively.</p>
        <p>The scorn for the emerging framework of international norms looks especially disturbing when combined with a pugnacious commitment to missile defense. ''On the one hand,'' says Janice Stein, director of the Munk Center for International Studies at the University of Toronto, ''there's a disengagement from most of the issues and most of the international frameworks; on the other hand, a willingness to say to the Russians: 'You don't like it? That's too bad.' That's not a comforting view for close neighbors and friends.''</p>
        <p>This growing anxiety burst into view in October, when Stephen Hadley, a member of the Bush team, had to reassure Lord Robertson, the secretary general of NATO, after Condoleezza Rice said that Bush favored ''a new division of labor'' among the allies that might have led the United States to withdraw its troops from the Balkans. Hadley delivered the message that a Bush administration would not act unilaterally; in fact, Bush came to Clinton's aid when he publicly opposed the Byrd-Warner bill, which would have placed a specified date on the withdrawal of American troops. Still, Europeans fear that, as with N.M.D., the Bush administration will act unilaterally if persuasion fails. This is an issue of overwhelming importance to many Europeans, who watched with horror as Bosnian irregulars took their peacekeeping soldiers hostage when NATO engaged in ''pinprick'' bombing in 1994. There were no American forces on the ground at the time. ''The lesson we all drew from Bosnia,'' says Mats Berdal, an analyst at the International Institute of Strategic Studies in London, ''is that Europeans being on the ground and Americans not is a disastrous combination.''</p>
        <p>But the Bush team does not believe that American soldiers should be escorting children to kindergarten, in the Balkans or anywhere else. American soldiers will be preparing for global engagements like the gulf war, even if that means that the world's greatest fighting machine never fights, while lesser forces can face the perils of peacekeeping around the globe. In the new division of labor that Rice and others envision, regional forces would keep the peace in local hot spots, while the U.S. military provided intelligence, airlift, command and control, but not ground troops. The European Union has been talking about creating a 60,000-man ''rapid deployment force,'' and some Bush advisers believe that this force could replace the Americans in Bosnia and Kosovo. ''If the European military force is going to have any role,'' one aide says, ''why wouldn't this be one?'' It's both a plausible strategy and a fair question; but at least at the moment, the rapid deployment force is wholly hypothetical. So if the Bush administration withdraws, what becomes of the Balkans?</p>
        <p>George W. Bush has said that he favored the bombing in Bosnia in 1995 and Kosovo in 1999; nevertheless, just as he opposes the use of the American military for peacekeeping and nation-building, so he thinks that, with extremely rare exceptions, it should not be engaged in humanitarian interventions. In an interview with Sam Donaldson last January, Bush said that if another Rwanda occurred on his watch, he would not send American troops, though he would speak with the United Nations and ''encourage them to move.'' This was not far from saying, ''It's none of our business.'' Clinton, of course, kept out of Rwanda, and in fact blocked Security Council action, though he later apologized for his inaction. Bush, presumably, would not have apologized, because Rwanda, and Africa generally, do not make the list of vital interests.</p>
        <p>There is a spectrum of opinion on humanitarian intervention that stretches from ''almost always'' to ''virtually never.'' A number of Republicans have tried to come up with theoretical formulations for positions somewhere in the center. Richard Haass, a former colleague of Rice's on the National Security Council, has argued in a book called ''The Reluctant Sheriff'' that intervention may be appropriate in order to protect lives or to promote nation-building in cases when vital interests do not dictate otherwise. Arnold Kanter, who was an undersecretary of state in the Bush administration, has made a similar argument. ''We as Americans,'' Kanter writes, ''must face ourselves, live with the consequences of our action or inaction.''</p>
        <p>Most of Bush's advisers, however, can live with themselves quite well without Haass's or Kanter's formulations. Dov Zakheim, for example, has written that the scale of atrocities in places like the Balkans is often exaggerated, and that in any case violating another nation's sovereignty threatens ''to unravel the entire fabric of international relations.'' Zakheim concludes that we should intervene ''only when our own interests are clearly at stake, or when genocide is so manifest that refusal to act would destroy our moral leadership of the free world.'' In other words, if we can preserve our moral leadership without acting in the face of genocide, that's fine. The Zakheim Doctrine brings moral considerations about as close to zero as humanly possible.</p>
        <p>Zakheim, Rice and others say that we should rely on regional actors, as we did in East Timor and Sierra Leone. There is nothing wrong with this, in theory, but countries with highly professional armies, like Australia, do not generally live next door to tormented places like East Timor. And much less professional armies cannot be counted on to intervene effectively and to stick around as long as needed, as the example of Nigerian forces in Sierra Leone has made clear. Some moderate Republicans have suggested that the United Nations should dispatch forces in such circumstances. It is, however, virtually impossible to get a member of Bush's inner circle to utter a positive word about U.N. peacekeeping. And so if an effective regional actor doesn't happen to be available during the next mass slaughter, the Bush administration may have to decide whether or not to violate its principles.</p>
        <p>And this brings us back to Colin Powell and his famous doctrine, which stipulates that military force should be used only to support a clear political objective and with sufficient resources to ensure success. The paradox of Powell's career is that he opposed the one war that satisfied his own stringent terms, arguing that we would suffer hundreds or even thousands of deaths in Iraq, and that the American people would never accept casualties to keep the price of oil down. But since the war made him a hero, his misjudgment was forgotten. Powell then began applying the Iraq test to other interventions and found them wanting. He played a major role in preventing the Clinton administration from acting in Bosnia in 1993, while he continued to serve as chairman of the joint chiefs of staff. He was convinced that the Balkans were Vietnam redux. The Serbs, Croats and Muslims, he wrote, ''are committed to fight to the death for what they believe to be their vital interests,'' while the West ''has not been able to find its vital interests or matching commitment.'' Powell turned out, fortunately, to be wrong on this score as well; he seems to be so reluctant to commit American forces in unconventional circumstances that he underestimates their ability to prevent suffering and provide a measure of stability. He appears never to have acknowledged his mistakes nor to have changed his views.</p>
        <p>You hear a lot, in the theorizing by the Bush camp, about the supposedly harmful effects of ''low intensity'' interventions on the U.S. military; you don't hear much about the actual human beings on the other end. Timely intervention by U.N. forces could have saved countless lives in Rwanda. The Bush administration's failure to act in Bosnia in 1991 ''wasted the opportunity to save over a hundred thousand lives,'' Warren Zimmerman, then the ambassador to Yugoslavia, later wrote. The Clinton administration's dithering was equally responsible for that catastrophe, perhaps more so. Now a new Bush administration is talking about withdrawing those troops. What would that mean to the Bosnians and Kosovars themselves? ''Ordinary people look at Americans as the people who brought peace to them,'' says Senad Pecanin, editor of Dani, the largest political weekly in Bosnia. ''If the Americans leave, it would be a signal to the nationalists that they could resume their policy to divide Bosnia.'' In Kosovo, Veton Surroi, publisher of Koha Ditore, the leading political daily in the area, says that the news that a Bush administration might gradually withdraw American troops ''was a welcome message for extremists on both the Serb and the Albanian side.'' American troops constitute less than 20 percent of the total in Bosnia and Kosovo, but Bosnians and Kosovars both talk about the psychological importance of their presence; the commitment seems real as long as the global superpower is there, on the ground.</p>
        <p>Not very long ago, an American president said, ''We have a vision of a new partnership of nations . . . based on consultation, cooperation and collective action . . . whose goals are to increase democracy, increase prosperity, increase the peace and reduce arms.'' A chairman of the joint chiefs said: ''In every corner of the world our troops are at work. These warriors of freedom, these men and women who love peace, who are prepared to die for its preservation, are doing their important part to help fulfill the concepts of the United Nations Charter.'' The president was George Bush -- the other George Bush -- and the military man was Colin Powell. It seems almost incredible that, only a decade later, that faith in the moral purposes of American power could come to seem so softheaded, so ill suited to the real world. Perhaps the old language, in retrospect, was too big; but the new language is very, very small. Has the world changed so very much since then? Or is it we who have changed?</p>
