        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The article ''It's Getting Easier to Be Green'' on March 16 brings home the important message that all of us, from individuals to governments to businesses, can reap the benefits of energy savings, cleaner air and reduced dependency on foreign oil, by incorporating green technologies for our energy uses.</p>
        <p>Besides the energy-efficiency initiatives at our Clarence D. Rappleyea Building in downtown White Plains, three of the projects mentioned in the article -- solar panels at the Yonkers wastewater treatment plant,electric cars and energy-efficient garage lighting in White Plains -- were the results of collaborations between the New York Power Authority and county and local governments, which are our customers for low-cost electricity.</p>

        <p>Many of Westchester's municipalities, school and fire districts have sought the expertise of the authority for recommendations and for our services to install these technologies.</p>
        <p>Energy-saving projects around the county are saving taxpayers more than $6.5 million per year on the energy bills for many public facilities and eliminating 52,487 tons of greenhouse gases annually from the environment.</p>
