        <p>Get on with it. That's what I found myself muttering tonight during the opening ceremony of the Winter Games.</p>
        <p>It was a thrill when Muhammad Ali materialized on the scaffolding in Atlanta in 1996 and when Cathy Freeman blazed through the night in Sydney in 2000. If it seemed somewhat less of a thrill last night when Mike Eruzione and his mates from the United States' 1980 Miracle on Ice hockey team materialized to light the caldron, it was only because a lot of people had figured they were the logical candidates.</p>
        <p>But at least they were athletes, famous athletes, symbolic athletes, to be sure. The more emphasis on pageantry or politics, the more the athletes become obscured.</p>
        <p>Personally, I can't wait to get up to a mountain Saturday to watch some daredevils whip around a sharp curve at high speed. Let's go.</p>
        <p>Every time they throw one of these Winter Games or Summer Games, we all get caught up in the opening ceremony. Tonight's ceremony had its moments, using an ice surface for ballet motion and depicting the history of the West, although glossing over a few gory details and making the relationship of American Indians and the settlers seem as benign as a square dance. But that's show biz, and that's what opening ceremonies are.</p>
        <p>The normal trappings of patriotism and the touching tributes to everybody can get dicey when there are real issues out there in the world -- and when are there not?</p>
        <p>This time there was the great flag flap. The world is still going through agony stemming from the attack on the United States last September. Yes, there were cretins who applauded, but anybody who thinks people in other countries did not bleed for America is missing something.</p>
        <p>Just by coincidence, there was a Winter Games in the United States coming up five months after the attacks. The horror and the bravery and the hope from Sept. 11 absolutely had to be commemorated here, and they were tonight.</p>
        <p>''Your nation is overcoming a horrific tragedy and we stand by you,'' said Jacques Rogge, the new president of the International Olympic Committee. And earlier, eight American athletes had carried the tattered flag from the World Trade Center for the national anthem.</p>
        <p>President Bush referred to the last five months when he departed from the tradition of a 16-word opening speech. He used 23 words: ''On behalf of a proud, determined and grateful nation, I declare open the Games of Salt Lake City, celebrating the Olympic Winter Games.''</p>
        <p>Normally, the national leader would say, ''I declare open the Games of Salt Lake City, celebrating the XXIII Olympiad of the modern era,'' perhaps using 17 words because of the length of this host name.</p>
        <p>It's a touchy decision to deviate even the slightest from Olympic protocol. What happens in 2008 if the Beijing hosts want to display a souvenir from the American spy plane that was downed in 2001 or some artifact from the Chinese embassy in Belgrade that was hit by NATO rockets in 1999? I'm just guessing the United States might take it personally.</p>
        <p>The evening was pleasant and there were even a few lovely snow flurries, and the winds that had blown away the inversion revealed there are indeed real mountains out there. The Wasatch Valley was glorious, if cold, as everybody in thick parkas tried to cram into the ceremony.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the hills are alive with the sound of hard-rock mogul music. I'm more interested in whether Michelle Kwan can hit her jumps and win the gold medal, or whether somebody else will be playing the role of Tara Lipinski in this performance. I can't wait for Slava Fetisov's Russians to meet Herb Brooks's Americans next Saturday. That is the real stuff.</p>
        <p>The debate over the flag touched off the normal resistance to American domination of the Olympic movement along with concern over the United States' role in global warming and the growing worldwide gap between rich and poor.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes our impetuousness leads to misunderstanding,'' said Sandra Baldwin, the United States' new member of the I.O.C. She added that Americans ''have not always been good partners,'' but she did not apologize for the American sponsors and the American network money that drive the Olympics.</p>
        <p>''It is what it is,'' Baldwin said.</p>
        <p>The United States cannot win that one. The only thing it can do is show restraint, which is not easy when thugs are flying planes into your buildings. At most Summer Games and Winter Games, the loudest fans are usually Americans, stridently chanting, ''U-S-A!''</p>
        <p>But as Baldwin noted, ''I loved it when people chanted, 'Aussie-Aussie-Aussie' in Sydney.''</p>
        <p>America is not so cute. The effervescent Mitt Romney, head of the organizing committee, hopes the Mormons of Utah, who have served on missions in many countries, will set a tone of worldliness and inclusiveness for other Americans.</p>
        <p>''I remember in Norway in 1994, when Tommy Moe won the downhill,'' Baldwin said. ''Norwegians were congratulating us -- and they finished behind us.''</p>
        <p>There was a warm tone tonight. The predominantly American crowd was warmed up by the television personalities Al Roker and Matt Lauer, but the evening did not become merely a raucous celebration of America. The audience cheered for Iran as it did for more friendly nations, but it did reserve its lustiest cheers for the delegation from Britain, the United States' biggest supporter since the attacks.</p>
        <p>Will the congeniality and sportsmanship carry over? One can only hope. The U.S.O.C. does not help by talking up medal counts. Theoretically, the Games are about individual athletes, seeking to do their best.</p>
        <p>The organizers mean well with the pageants and the tributes, the music and the words and the costumes at the opening ceremonies. I'm waiting for the youth and the bustle of the athletes. I want to see 18-year-old Ilya Kovalchuk shoot the puck for Russia, and 16-year-old Sarah Hughes do her jumps for America, and all the Scandinavians and Japanese and the Canadians. With all due respect to the opening ceremony -- the sooner the better.</p>
