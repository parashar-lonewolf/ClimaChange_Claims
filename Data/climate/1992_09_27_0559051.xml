        <p>IT may not seem obvious to anyone who has slipped on a patch during the winter, but ice is sticky. So sticky, in fact, that it accumulates on the refrigerant tubes used in cooling systems for buildings, reducing energy efficiency. Now engineers at the Electric Power Research Institute are testing a substance that prevents solid ice from building up while at the same time producing a slush that cools a building more effectively than the chilled water that is currently used.</p>
        <p>The innovation could prove valuable in new kinds of "cool-storage systems" that are being designed to improve the energy efficiency of cooling systems of buildings and to shift power consumption away from times of day when electricity is most expensive. Cool storage involves operating a refrigeration system at night to make and store ice. Water is chilled as it passes over the stored ice. Then it is pumped through the building, entering radiators on each floor, where fans blow air over it and into working spaces.

        <p>IT may not seem obvious to anyone who has slipped on a patch during the winter, but ice is sticky. So sticky, in fact, that it accumulates on the refrigerant tubes used in cooling systems for buildings, reducing energy efficiency. Now engineers at the Electric Power Research Institute are testing a substance that prevents solid ice from building up while at the same time producing a slush that cools a building more effectively than the chilled water that is currently used.</p>
        <p>The innovation could prove valuable in new kinds of "cool-storage systems" that are being designed to improve the energy efficiency of cooling systems of buildings and to shift power consumption away from times of day when electricity is most expensive. Cool storage involves operating a refrigeration system at night to make and store ice. Water is chilled as it passes over the stored ice. Then it is pumped through the building, entering radiators on each floor, where fans blow air over it and into working spaces. This cooling process augments the work of the mechanical air-conditioner, so the unit does not have to be as big or operate as frequently.</p>
        <p>Because nights are usually cooler than days, it requires less energy to make ice at night. What is more, off-peak power rates are typically lower than those at midday, so the power user saves money. And electric utilities can use their capacity more efficiently.</p>
        <p>According to engineers at the research institute, a think tank based in Palo Alto, Calif., that is sponsored by electric utilities, more than 2,000 cool-storage systems are operating across the country, switching a total of 425 megawatts of power (about half the capacity of a large nuclear plant) from peak to off-peak periods. Researchers at the institute say that by the middle of this decade, cool-storage systems will be 10 percent more energy efficient than the best conventional systems now available.</p>
        <p>BUT there is still the problem of sticky ice. Cooling systems typically run a chilled refrigerant fluid through metal tubes immersed in a tank of water, a system known as a heat exchanger. Heat flows from the water to the colder refrigerant inside the tubes, allowing the water to cool before it is pumped throughout the building. But during this process, ice forms on the tubes, just as frost tends to accumulate in a refrigerator's freezer compartment.</p>
        <p>To be sure, ice in the water outside the tubes helps the cooling process. But the ice that accumulates on the tubes themselves acts as insulation, making it harder to transfer heat from the water in the tank to the refrigerant. E.P.R.I. engineers estimate that ice on heat exchanger tubes raises energy consumption by about 10 percent.</p>
        <p>Some systems add what amounts to a defrost cycle to cope with the problem. Instead of a refrigerant, hot gas is periodically sent down the pipes to knock ice off the tubes. The problem is that this cuts efficiency by about 10 percent, as well.</p>
        <p>Ronald Wendland, the institute's manager of thermal storage technology, said researchers had been working for nearly a decade on the sticky ice problem. One early approach was to use slick coatings, similar to Teflon, on the tubes to prevent adhesion by ice. But nothing worked very well, because of the strong chemical bond ice forms with any cold surface.</p>
        <p>Using antifreeze in the water outside the pipes was also unsatisfactory, because this lowers the freezing point of water and inhibits the formation of the ice needed for the cooling system.</p>
        <p>So Mr. Wendland and his colleagues came up with what they call "slippery ice." They add to the water a substance, calcium magnesium acetate, that prevents a buildup of ice on the heat-exchanger tubes. "It appears as though a different type of ice crystal forms, one that has no structural strength," said Mr. Wendland.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the water turns into a slushy mass that is about half ice, but can still be circulated. Cool-storage systems using slippery ice should be cheaper to manufacture than existing systems, because they do not need a defrost cycle and can use thinner-walled tubes in the heat exchanger, which aids in heat transfer. And power consumption is reduced 15 to 20 percent.</p>
        <p>Because slippery ice is a mixture of ice and water, it has more cooling capacity than chilled water alone. And because it is a pumpable fluid, it can be delivered to remote locations that would be very difficult to reach with systems using solid ice.</p>
        <p>For these reasons, E.P.R.I. officials say slippery ice may be suitable for cooling systems in which a central plant supplies slush to several buildings. This would be analogous to heating systems in which a utility company's generating plant supplies steam to nearby buildings.</p>
        <p>A utility could use its underutilized generating capacity during the night to build up a supply of slippery ice that could be pumped to buildings during the day, when demand for air conditioning and electricity rises. The utility would benefit not only from running its plants more efficiently but also from revenue from selling air-conditioning.</p>
        <p>AND removing the cooling apparatus from close contact with people could allow the use of refrigerants now considered too toxic for office or home use. That would be particularly helpful because the refrigeration and cooling industries are seeking substitutes for chlorofluorocarbons, refrigerants that are being phased out in accordance with an international treaty because they harm the atmosphere's protective ozone layer.</p>
        <p>One such substitute could be ammonia, which is toxic but is also an efficient refrigerant. If the cooling unit were remote from the people using it, the danger from an accidental leak would be minimized.</p>
        <p>Slippery ice is coming out of the laboratory for testing, E.P.R.I. officials said. A cool storage system using the technology is to be installed later this year in a building owned by the Chevron Corporation in Dublin, Calif. And another is being prepared for shipment to Argonne National Laboratory, near Chicago, for a demonstration of district cooling.</p>
        <p>There is still a fair amount of mystery as to how the slippery-ice chemical, a strong electrolyte, inhibits the stickiness usually found in ice. "We have had the best chemists and physicists we could find look at it, and nobody can really explain it," Mr. Wendland said.</p>
        <p>The institute has patented the technology and designed a trademark for it -- a polar bear sliding down an iceberg.</p>
