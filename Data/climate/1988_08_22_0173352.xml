        <p>LEAD:  Lessing on Her Career</p>
        <p>Lessing on Her Career</p>
        <p>''I hate rhetoric,'' says Doris Lessing on the BBC's ''South Bank Show.'' Mrs. Lessing, who was a Communist Party member in the early 1950's, expresses disillusionment with the political left and with speeches in general. ''It's one of the things that stupefies us: the use of words to stop your thinking,'' she remarks, adding that ''children ought to be taught how to examine this.''</p>
        <p>The program, scheduled on the cable channel Bravo for Thursday at 10 P.M. and Sunday at 7 P.M., traces Mrs. Lessing's career as a novelist, playwright, poet and writer of science fiction, from her birth in Persia in 1919 and her early years in what was then the British colony of Southern Rhodesia.</p>
        <p>Interviewed by the biographer and literary critic Claire Tomlin and the science-fiction writer Brian Aldiss, Mrs. Lessing discusses works including ''The Good Terrorist'' (1985) and her most recent novel, ''The Fifth Child,'' in which a violent, alien baby is born to an ideal family. The program includes dramatization of some of her work. More Than the Weather</p>
        <p>The Weather Channel on cable doesn't expect viewers to sit glued to its 24-hour reports on conditions around the country and around the world. But it has started offering reasons to stay tuned for more than a quick update.</p>
        <p>On Sunday at 6 P.M., for instance, it will offer ''The Global Crisis,'' a 90-minute documentary on the causes and consequences of the greenhouse effect, ozone depletion and acid rain.</p>
        <p>It will be the fourth documentary presented by the six-year-old network. Last summer, the topic was hurricanes, followed in the spring by thunderstorms and then, a month ago, one of Sunday's topics - the greenhouse effect. Four more documentaries are forecast for next year.</p>
        <p>And why not, given all those experts on hand. ''We have 60 meteorologists, so we probably have more scientists on staff than any other broadcast facility in the country,'' the producer of the documentaries, Linda Lloyd, said the other day from her headquarters in Atlanta. ''We think we have an opportunity to add to our own credibility and to contribute to education.'' On a more practical level, she added, ''the documentaries may introduce the Weather Channel to more people.''</p>
        <p>The network is available to some 35 million homes. At last count, 7.8 million of them were tuning in at least once a week for at least three minutes at a time.</p>
        <p>If they watch for 90 minutes on Sunday, they will see interviews, panel talks and tapes showing what man has wrought in such areas as the Gulf Coast, the Appalachian Mountains and Greece. A meteorologist, Charlie Welsh, will be the host, and viewers will be able to call in questions. Love Letters</p>
        <p>In a country town in Victorian England, an elegant middle-aged woman, stifled in a stale marriage, agrees to ghostwrite love letters for her illiterate housemaid, who has been seduced by a young lawyer from London. The letters express the woman's own romantic yearnings and impress the lawyer. Eventually, the ruse shatters everybody concerned.</p>
        <p>It happens in ''Day After the Fair,'' a film based on a Thomas Hardy tale that was produced by the BBC and the Arts &amp; Entertainment cable network. As part of an agreement with the producers, public television's ''Masterpiece Theater'' broadcast the American premiere of the drama last March. Now A&amp;E has scheduled it on Aug. 30 at 9 P.M.</p>
        <p>John J. O'Connor of The New York Times didn't find the story very convincing, but described its details as ''fascinating,'' the film as ''finely crafted'' and its cast as ''remarkably effective.''</p>
        <p>Hannah Gordon (the second Mrs. Bellamy in ''Upstairs, Downstairs'') portrays the ghostwriter, and Sammi Davis (the teen-age sister in ''Hope and Glory'') plays the maid. Stress and Health</p>
        <p>Women cry four times as often as men because of the hormone prolactin, and therefore may be better able to deal with stress.</p>
        <p>Starting at the age of 45, pessimists are at more risk for chronic illnesses than are optimists.</p>
        <p>Those are a couple of the conclusions in ''One Nation Under Stress,'' a documentary in which experts discuss the possible role of stress in the development and control of cancer, hypertension, heart attacks and other health problems.</p>
        <p>Scheduled Sept. 1 at 9 P.M. on Channel 5, the program, which is part of a ''Lifequest'' series produced by Group W Television, shows researchers at work. In one study, for instance, people who are set up to fail at a supposedly simple task - to shut off an annoying noise - showed a weakening of their immune system.</p>
        <p>Viewers need not feel anxious about all this; guidelines for handling stress are offered. One is an old prescription: laughter.</p>
