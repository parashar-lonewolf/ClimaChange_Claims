        <p>I was first saddened and confused, then angered and disgusted by the letter to the editor [Dec. 31] by the man who identified himself as the director of the American Family Association of New York and cited studies purporting to show that abortion increased a woman's risk of getting breast cancer.</p>
        <p>There are many thousands of women who have no familial or other risk factors and yet do get breast cancer. I do not carry the BRCA1 or 2 gene, I had my first child before age 30, I nursed both of my daughters, I do not drink or smoke, I have no breast cancer in my family, and I did not have an abortion. And yet I am a one-year breast cancer survivor.</p>

        <p>There are many thousands of women who have no familial or other risk factors and yet do get breast cancer. I do not carry the BRCA1 or 2 gene, I had my first child before age 30, I nursed both of my daughters, I do not drink or smoke, I have no breast cancer in my family, and I did not have an abortion. And yet I am a one-year breast cancer survivor.</p>
        <p>Most of the members of my support group are mothers and none that I've spoken with have had abortions.</p>
        <p>Almost daily, we read about the  latest investigations into the possible causes of this dread disease. From an overabundance of estrogen to the stresses in our daily lives to the hole in the ozone layer, many diverse possibilities are under consideration. None of the scientists of note have cited abortion as an overlooked possible cause. And yet, with so many possibilities to explore, the writer has chosen to suggest that a factor has been overlooked, his issue of abortion!</p>
        <p>I wonder what his thinking is on male breast cancer. Any abortions there?</p>
