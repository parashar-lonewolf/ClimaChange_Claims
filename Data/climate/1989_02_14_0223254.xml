        <p>LEAD: IN this icy world virtually devoid of the land plants that sustain most animal life elsewhere, survival of the spectacular species that live here - from albatrosses and penguins to seals and whales -hinges on a frigid sea teeming with microscopic plants and the tiny crustaceans called krill that eat them.</p>
        <p>IN this icy world virtually devoid of the land plants that sustain most animal life elsewhere, survival of the spectacular species that live here - from albatrosses and penguins to seals and whales -hinges on a frigid sea teeming with microscopic plants and the tiny crustaceans called krill that eat them.</p>
        <p>Now, worried about the threats posed by increased commercial fishing, drastic depletion of the protective ozone layer in the atmosphere and rising pollution of a once pristine habitat, biologists are stepping up their studies of vulnerable creatures that are the foundation of the Antarctic food chain.</p>
        <p>Krill, which in Antarctica might be called the food of the gods, is the sole or primary food for most of the whales and penguins, the crabeater seal and the large sea birds like petrels. It also sustains small fishes and squid, which in turn feed emperor penguins, albatrosses, large fishes, the sperm whale and most of the seals.</p>
        <p>But researchers fear that recent human intrusions, direct and indirect, are threatening the food supply and the future of dozens of exotic species that extract their living from the icy waters.</p>
        <p>The fuel spill from an Argentine freighter that ran aground near major penguin rookeries two weeks ago, resulting in the death of thousands of birds, particularly the hawk-like skuas and their chicks, has served to highlight the actual and potential threats to what has heretofore been the least polluted place on earth. Scientist are also concerned that fledgling penguins leaving their nests will enter the water and be coated with oil, which would cause them to lose insulation against the cold. And researchers have found signs that the spill has killed krill along the shoreline.</p>
        <p>''A spill like this should make us realize we have to clean up the total act,'' Dr. Langdon Queton, a biologist who studies krill at Palmer Station, said last week in a telephone interview. ''We've been polluting the Antarctic and it should stop before we end up with the kind of mess we have in urban America.'' Palmer Station is an American research facility on the Antarctic Peninsula, where the accident occurred.</p>
        <p>Although the environmental consequences of the fuel spill will be felt here for years, researchers hope it is a one-time disaster. Scientists believe the most serious dangers to the fragile Antarctic food web are far more insidious and long-lasting. They include the tons of garbage, much of it nondegradable, dumped overboard by ships carrying 3,000 visitors a year as well as the refuse from more than 50 year-round and part-time scientific research stations, all of which lack sanitation treatment facilities.</p>
        <p>Even more serious, recent studies indicate, is the potential loss of seaborne organisms at the base of the food chain through commercial harvest and increasingly intense solar radiation. During every austral spring for the last decade, a hole has formed in the ozone layer of the upper atmosphere, which shields organisms on or near the earth's surface from damaging ultraviolet light.</p>
        <p>Studies indicate that the hole over the Antarctic, which in recent years has covered an area as large as the United States, results from pollution by chlorofluorocarbons, chemicals that are widely used as aerosols and refrigerants.</p>
        <p>According to preliminary experiments conducted by American scientists at Palmer Station, ultraviolet radiation that slips through the ozone hole each spring can greatly reduce the photosynthetic ability of the microscopic plants called phytoplankton that convert the sun's energy into the food that sustains life here.</p>
        <p>When phytoplankton from Arthur Harbor outside the research station were exposed to ultraviolet light equivalent to what might reach Antarctic waters when the ozone hole is present, there was ''an alarming drop in photosynthesis, to as little as one-eighth what would normally occur,'' said Sayed El-Sayed, a marine biologist at Texas A &amp; M University.</p>
        <p>In studies conducted with Carol Stephens, he showed that ultraviolet sensitivity was particularly severe among the nannoplankton (single-cells plants between 2 and 20 microns wide) and picoplankton (smaller than 2 microns; a micron is one-thousandth of a millimeter). Together they account for about 90 percent of the primary production of the Antarctic waters. These organisms are food for baby krill. Protected From Climate</p>
        <p>Scientists cannot determine whether the drastic ozone depletion already recorded has damaged Antarctic life because no census has yet been taken of the natural density of the food supply. But the experimental evidence indicates that serious damage is possible.</p>
        <p>Oceanic plant life must support animal life here because the ocean is the only part of the Antarctic environment relatively protected from climatic extremes; on land temperatures can fall to minus 50 degrees Fahrenheit and winds can reach 150 miles an hour. Furthermore, said Sanford Moss, a biology professor at Southeastern Massachusetts University and author of ''Natural History of the Antarctic Peninsula'' (Columbia University Press, 1988), the waters of the Antarctic abound in nutrients that photosynthesizing plants can convert to useful energy.</p>
        <p>''Most of the phytoplankton does not get eaten here but rather dies and sinks to the bottom, where bacteria and protozoa recycle their nutrients,'' John B. Heiser, a marine biologist at Cornell University, said in an interview on the Antarctic Peninsula . ''Upwellings of cold water from the bottom bring the nutrients back to the surface to be used anew, and global ocean currents export them for use elsewhere.''</p>
        <p>As his ship left Palmer Station, just two weeks before the fuel spill, he scanned the rookeries crammed with hundreds of thousands of penguins and their fast-growing young, then glanced at the sea that supplies their food. ''We're now cruising through oceanic prairies that are equivalent to the rich plains of the American Midwest,'' Dr. Heiser said. Hairs Capture Phytoplankton</p>
        <p>Krill are especially well-designed to reap the oceanic harvest. In place of pinchers, these organisms have fine hairs on their legs that form a basket-like sieve to capture the phytoplankton. The two-inch organism can filter as much as 14 ounces of water an hour.</p>
        <p>Krill that are eaten by Antarctic denizens add to the richness of the environment. But, Dr. Heiser said, ''when krill are harvested and taken elsewhere, their nutrients are lost to the Antarctic forever.'' More than half a dozen nations are now fishing for Antarctic krill, netting approximately 500 metric tons a year, or less than 1 percent of the estimated total in Antarctic waters. The protein-rich crustaceans, which swim in huge swarms patchily distributed throughout the ocean, are being used to produce animal feed, pet food and food for fish farms.</p>
        <p>Japan and other countries also hope to use krill to produce direct food products for humans, but past predictions that krill would provide abundant and cheap protein for the world's hungry now appear unrealistic. ''I don't think krill will go into markets that would help to relieve world hunger,'' Dr. Heiser said. ''More likely it will be used to make Kentucky Fried Chicken cheaper.''</p>
        <p>Although the current krill harvest is not considered worrisome, no one knows how much krill can be safely harvested without threatening the survival of existing wildlife or disrupting the comeback of the great baleen whales, including the blue whale and humpback, that subsist on krill. These giant mammals - at 100 to 200 tons, the blue whale is the largest animal ever to have lived - have in place of teeth plates of baleen, a horny material that is frayed on one end, through which krill can be strained. A single blue whale can consume three to four tons of krill. Eating Algae Under the Ice</p>
        <p>Working here under National Science Foundation grants, Queton Ross and his wife, Robin, both biologists from the University of California at Santa Barbara, are conducting basic studies of Antarctic krill, from egg to adult, to determine how they acquire energy and what they do with it. The researchers showed that during the short Antarctic summer, from December to mid-February, krill can spawn 7 to 10 times to make the most of available food.</p>
        <p>They also found that at least in this part of the Southern Ocean the adult krill do not feed in winter and actually shrink a little. Their larvae, however, continue growing because they eat the algae on the undersurface of the ice that surrounds the peninsula in winter.</p>
        <p>Dr. Queton said much remains to be determined about the habits of krill and how they can be safely harvested. The choice krill for harvest, he noted, are egg-bearing females, and the choice locations are where krill are most densely congregated.</p>
        <p>''The harvest could have serious effects if ships troll only in areas where there are large populations of gravid adult females,'' he said.</p>
        <p>By feeding on krill, which are only one step from the bottom of the food web, the larger animals of the Antarctic have chosen a strategy that fosters survival in an area of fragile and scanty food resources, Dr. Heiser said. ''Feeding close to the sun, at the bottom of the food web, is the only way to maintain a population where the sun is more rare than anywhere else on earth,'' he said. ''No matter what the animal and no matter what it eats, it takes about 10 pounds of food to put on one pound of animal weight. The further away from the sun an animal eats, the less food there is available.'' High and Low on the Food Chain</p>
        <p>As Dr. Heiser explained, it takes 1,000 pounds of phytoplankton to produce 100 pounds of krill, and that 100 pounds of krill will produce 10 pounds of crabeater seal. The 10 pounds of crabeater will produce 1 pound of leopard seal, which in turn will produce less than 2 ounces of killer whale.</p>
        <p>''This is why emperor penguins are the rarest of penguins - they eat squid, which in turn eat krill - and why big, fierce carnivores are extremely rare in Antarctica,'' Dr. Heiser said. ''If you eat high in the food web, there's not much of a food base to exist on and it's hard to find.''</p>
        <p>Thus, leopard seals, which prey on penguins and other seals, and killer whales, which prey primarily on leopard seals and other whales, are few and far between. Leopard seals do better than killer whales perhaps because their more catholic diet includes lots of krill and any other animals they can capture.</p>
        <p>Like the krill themselves, most Antarctic animals endure long periods of starvation during which they may lose as much as half their body weight. The penguins, which have been most carefully studied, eat only at sea. Dr. William Sladen of Johns Hopkins University, who spent 20 years studying the behavior of Adelie penguins, said the birds start emerging from the sea in October when they may have to trek 200 miles across the ice to reach their breeding grounds. Alternating Chick-Care</p>
        <p>After laying her two eggs, the female returns to the sea to replenish herself, leaving her mate to incubate the eggs. A parent must guard the eggs and subsequent chicks at all times lest they fall prey to the ever-present skuas.</p>
        <p>By the time the chicks are ready to hatch, the male has been fasting for about seven weeks and has lost 40 percent of his body weight. Now, the female returns replete with food to regurgitate for her chicks. After a nest-relieving ceremony, the male leaves for the sea to recoup his losses. The trek over ice gets shorter as summer temperatures rise above freezing. After several weeks, he returns to take another turn at chick-rearing.</p>
        <p>The parents alternate chick-care until summer's end in mid-February, when the chicks themselves are ready to take their first swim and taste of undigested krill. If they make it past the voracious leopard seal that often waits at the shore for a penguin dinner, the fledgling penguins will stay at sea for several years until they are old enough to breed.</p>
        <p>To document this precarious life cycle, Dr. Sladen and his colleagues banded 5,000 youngsters every February just before they left the rookery. The researchers also used a cloacascope to determine the sex of the penguins (males and females have no external differences) and a gastrointestinal tube to sample what they had been eating: invariably krill and an occasional squid.</p>
        <p>Correction:  February 16, 1989, Thursday, Late City Final Edition</p>
        <p>An illustration and a caption in Science Times on Tuesday about threats to Antartica's wildlife mislabeled a penguin species and incorrectly described the diets of two species. The illustration showed a Chinstrap penguin, not an Emperor; both the Chinstrap and the Adelie penguin, also pictured, eat mainly krill, not fish and squid. The names of two researchers were also given incorrectly in some references. They are a married couple, Langdon Queton and Robin Ross.</p>
