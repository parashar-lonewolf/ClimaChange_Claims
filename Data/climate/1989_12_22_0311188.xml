        <p>One of the lessons that 1980's pop culture has taught is that nothing really disappears. So enormous is the nostalgic appetite for the moods and attitudes of the past that sooner or later even the most despised pop kitsch becomes ripe for resurrection As recently as a decade ago, a revue devoted to the insipid American pop of the Mitch Miller era would probably not have found an audience. Rock-and-roll, though heading into middle age at that time, still reigned supreme. But to a younger pop audience that has grown up in the more conservative, conformist 80's, the wholesome pop iconography of the 50's doesn't seem so remote. That may explain why youthful crowds are flocking to two amusing cabaret revues, both of which celebrate music that rock-and-roll was supposed to have eradicated forever.</p>
        <p>''The Cardigans . . . Those Swingin' Singin' Guys From Alpha Mu Phi Pi,'' at the Westbeth Theater Cabaret, and ''Forever Plaid,'' at Steve McGraw's, both revive the pre-rock male harmony group tradition of the Crew Cuts, the Four Lads, the Four Aces, the Ames Brothers and others that the sexier sounds of rhythm-and-blues-oriented doo-wop overthrew on the pop charts. Both shows feature quartets of young singer actors who skillfully re-create the tight harmonies and squeaky-clean collegiate images of vocal groups that 30 years ago seemed to caricature the pop ideals of white American culture.</p>
        <p>In their show at the Westbeth Theater Cabaret, the four Cardigans -Chuck (Brian Hurst), Johnny (Ray Wills), Buddy (Steve Fickinger) and Frankie (Brad Carpenter) - sing such vintage fluff as the Crew Cuts' ''Oop Shoop,'' the Gaylords' ''Little Shoemaker,'' Neil Sedaka's ''Oh Carol,'' and Johnny Preston's ''Running Bear.''</p>
        <p>''Forever Plaid,'' which was created by Stuart Ross, who wrote the book for the Broadway musical ''Starmites,'' has had several different lives in cabarets and theaters around the country. All told, 33 different performers have portrayed the four Plaids - Francis, Jinx, Sparky and Smudge - a mythical quartet that perished in 1964 when their car collided with a busful of schoolgirls bound for the Beatles' American debut on ''The Ed Sullivan Show.'' Through a time warp and a hole in the ozone layer, the group has come back to earth for one night to give the concert that the accident prevented them from singing. The program includes ''Three Coins in the Fountain,'' ''Moments to Remember,'' ''No Not Much,'' and ''Perfidia'' as well as their version of the Beatles' ''She Loves You,'' in which ''yeah yeah yeah'' becomes ''yes sirree, Bob.'' Composite of Three Groups</p>
        <p>The Cardigans are the brainchild of the show's writer and musical director, Rick Lewis, who two years ago dreamed up the Taffetas, a composite of the Chordettes, the McGuire Sisters and the Lennon Sisters. The Taffetas' show opened last April at the Westbeth Theater Cabaret and was a modest success, later moving to the Cherry Lane Theater and then to the Village Gate.</p>
        <p>''The Cardigans are the Taffetas' male counterparts, only spoofier,'' Mr. Lewis said the other day. ''I found that the guys could get away with a lot of expressions that the girls would never be able to say, like 'golly,' without seeming too camp.''</p>
        <p>As he did for the Taffetas, Mr. Lewis invented personalities and a history for the Cardigans. All four are ministers' sons and recent graduates of Wooster College, a Presbyterian institution in Ohio. All were members of the same fictional fraternity, Alpha Mu Phi Pi. Inspiration From Old 45's</p>
        <p>The Plaids have a more fanciful history. Brought up in western Pennsylvania, the members are graduates of the Osterizer School of Harmonic Theory. Early in their act, they demonstrate the four harmonic modes they were taught in music school: blend, puree, mix and chop.</p>
        <p>''Forever Plaid'' was inspired by the artwork on old 45-r.p.m. records that Mr. Ross unearthed one day and began playing.</p>
        <p>''The guys were so suave and earnest looking that I started listening to the records and found the harmonies breathtaking,'' he recalled. ''I decided to put together a show about them called 'Butchwax.' ''</p>
        <p>''Butchwax,'' which was later renamed ''Forever Plaid,'' evolved slowly in performances at the West Bank Cafe and later at the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center in Waterford, Conn., where attempts were made to expand it into a full-scale musical. Different versions of the show have since played in different locations. One version was a Christmas special called ''Plaid Tidings.'' In another, more elaborate version, it was a two-hour musical play in which the the spirits of the Plaids return to possess the bodies of a heavy-metal rock band. Caricatured With Affection</p>
        <p>The most striking thing about both revues is the respect shown to the music. Both casts re-create the post-barbershop harmonic style of the Crew Cuts and Four Lads with an impressive precision. Even while caricaturing that style, the shows demonstrate a strong affection for 50's pop squareness.</p>
        <p>''Though I couldn't resist the temptation to get some great laughs, I wanted the music to be beautiful,'' Mr. Ross emphasized. ''It was an ultimate prerequisite that the music fly.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lewis said: ''The neatest thing about the Cardigans is when you're doing the show and happen to look at the audience in the middle of a number and see a couple in their 40's snuggling a little closer. You feel you've transported them back to their first date.''</p>
        <p>''Forever Plaid,'' which has been playing an irregular schedule at Steve McGraw's (158 West 72d Street), has one performance this weekend, at midnight tomorrow. There is an $8 minimum and an $8 cover charge. Information: 595-7400.</p>
        <p>The Cardigans will be at the Westbeth Theater Cabaret (151 Bank Street) tonight and tomorrow at 9. Tickets are $15. Information: 741-0391.</p>
