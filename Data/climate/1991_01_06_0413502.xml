        <p>THE ASCENT OF MIND  Ice Age Climates and the Evolution of Intelligence. By William H. Calvin. Illustrated. 302 pp. New York: Bantam Books. $21.95.</p>
        <p>THE human brain is four times as large as that of the apes from which humans evolved 2.5 million years ago. By evolution's time frame, that's stunningly rapid development. What can account for it?</p>
        <p>The quick evolution of big brains, suggests William H. Calvin in "The Ascent of Mind," must have been</p>
        <p>driven</p>
        <p>by something. And that something was climatic change. "A brain that can function in various different climates has an advantage over one that is merely efficient in a single climate," he writes. "Retaining those jack-of-all-trades abilities is a lot easier if the climate keeps switching around unpredictably." And switch around is just what the climate has done for the last few million years. There have been minor climatic shifts every 10,000 years or so, and these have been superimposed on meltbacks of the northern ice sheets every 100,000 years.</p>
        <p>In Mr. Calvin's scenario, the meltbacks, with their warm greeting to all life, to new species and to evolutionary adaptations, counted just as much as the rounds of cold and ice; the terrestrial spring welcomed changes, while the wintry hard times weeded out the less useful among them. To use a term of which Mr. Calvin, alas, never tires, the alternating climates "ratcheted up" intelligence.</p>
        <p>But just how? Mr. Calvin believes the act of throwing had a lot to do with it. In pursuit of scarce food during frigid winters, early hominids chased animals across the countryside and threw rocks at them. Thus, the early hunters' throwing skills -- skills that have reached their highest expression in the 95-mile-an-hour fastballs hurled by major league pitchers -- mattered greatly.</p>
        <p>Primates, according to Mr. Calvin, have always known how to throw -- but not accurately. Indeed, what archeologists call the Acheulean ax, a staple fossil around the world, was no ax at all, he says, but a kind of "killer Frisbee." Lobbed high over a herd of massed animals, it would drop straight down on them. Since the projectile was apt to hit something or other in the herd, the thrower didn't have to be terribly precise. But those who could throw accurately, reasons Mr. Calvin, would have had an important evolutionary advantage. After all, a tomato-sized rock, hurled with great force square at an animal's head, would carry vastly greater stopping power than a projectile dropped from above.</p>
        <p>Power and control didn't evolve overnight, though. To throw accurately one must time the rock's release to within a thousandth of a second. And that, says Mr. Calvin, who is a neurobiologist at the University of Washington and the author of "The Cerebral Symphony," means that many neurons must set to work on the problem. Primates blessed with enough neurons to spare, he maintains, were better suited to survive -- and well on their way to writing books, playing chess and planning for tomorrow.</p>
        <p>"Is the picture of hominid evolution sketched in the preceding chapters correct?" asks the author near the end of his book. "Almost surely not, at least in some details -- and probably in some major feature. . . . What I am really trying to do is to improve the standards of what constitutes a serious proposal for hominid evolutionary mechanisms."</p>
        <p>Whatever the scientific merits of Mr. Calvin's "proposal," it needs editorial work. It is hopelessly episodic, rambling and repetitive. Part of the problem stems from the author's sheer literary ambition. He is not content to make his case clearly and simply, but rather weaves into the main text what amounts to a second book, a kind of ecological travelogue. Mr. Calvin takes us on a long flight over Greenland and Iceland to look down on the glaciers that have advanced and retreated over the ages. We visit islands, ride ferries, explore ancient Indian fishing villages. There's always some tie to the intellectual business at hand, but often it is a flimsy one, and thus the detours detract from, rather than enhance, the book as a whole.</p>
        <p>At one point, for example, Mr. Calvin wonders how species lengthen or shorten their reproductive cycle to be in sync with the climate; he asks, "What aspects of the environment are 'read' for the forecast?" Then he quotes from Immanuel Kant's "Metaphysics of Morals," slides into a four-paragraph digression about Tolmie Peak and other volcanoes of the Pacific Northwest, lingers briefly among the hummingbirds and the bees. Finally, to get himself back on track two pages later, having advanced the action not a bit, he is forced to repeat: "What aspect of the environment is 'read' to predict boom times ahead?"</p>
        <p>Mr. Calvin's travelogue can be appealing enough. But when he wends his way back to science, he relies over and over again on pet phrases: the size of the human brain, for instance, is forever being "pumped up" by one evolutionary force or another. And too often the reader confronts language that has no business on the printed page at all: "Our big heads may be only an epiphenomenon of a developmental solution to the temporary synchronization requirement for accurate throwing, as our ancestors juvenilized to retain the more widespread intracortical connections of juvenile animals into adulthood (or, more likely, juvenilized during a boom time for the usual reproductive race, but didn't drift back later because throwing success kept the more juvenilized versions well fed as the climate worsened)."</p>
        <p>All this is grist for the editor this book needed and never got.</p>
