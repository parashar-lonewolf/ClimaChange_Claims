        <p>In a transparent bit of salesmanship that should not be mistaken for a serious policy, the Bush administration announced Wednesday that it had persuaded several major industries to make voluntary reductions in the rate at which they produce carbon dioxide and other gases that contribute to global warming. It was the administration's latest effort to show that voluntary controls will make unnecessary the mandatory reductions called for by many scientists, environmentalists and members of Congress -- as well as by the 1997 Kyoto Protocol that Mr. Bush rejected after taking office.</p>
        <p>There are two main problems with the Bush policy. First, he is asking almost nothing in the way of real sacrifice. A serious approach would request net reductions in emissions. Mr. Bush asks only for a decrease in what he calls ''carbon intensity,'' under which emissions can grow as long as they increase more slowly than the economy itself. That of course misses the point. The atmospheric buildup of carbon, already alarmingly high, is cumulative. Thus the name of the game is to start reducing emissions, not merely to slow their rate of growth. Indeed, by Mr. Bush's own calculations, his program would translate into an actual increase in emissions of 14 percent over the next 10 years.</p>

        <p>In a transparent bit of salesmanship that should not be mistaken for a serious policy, the Bush administration announced Wednesday that it had persuaded several major industries to make voluntary reductions in the rate at which they produce carbon dioxide and other gases that contribute to global warming. It was the administration's latest effort to show that voluntary controls will make unnecessary the mandatory reductions called for by many scientists, environmentalists and members of Congress -- as well as by the 1997 Kyoto Protocol that Mr. Bush rejected after taking office.</p>
        <p>There are two main problems with the Bush policy. First, he is asking almost nothing in the way of real sacrifice. A serious approach would request net reductions in emissions. Mr. Bush asks only for a decrease in what he calls ''carbon intensity,'' under which emissions can grow as long as they increase more slowly than the economy itself. That of course misses the point. The atmospheric buildup of carbon, already alarmingly high, is cumulative. Thus the name of the game is to start reducing emissions, not merely to slow their rate of growth. Indeed, by Mr. Bush's own calculations, his program would translate into an actual increase in emissions of 14 percent over the next 10 years.</p>
        <p>Second, voluntarism won't do the job. The only strategy that makes economic and environmental sense, as the successful acid rain program has shown, is one that sets mandatory national limits on emissions and asks everyone to do his part. For one thing, companies are unlikely to spend millions of dollars on pollution control equipment if their competitors aren't doing likewise. For another, emissions trading -- which is seen as a way to reduce the overall costs -- will not work properly without a nationwide cap.</p>
        <p>For all these reasons, an increasing number of legislators, most recently Senators John McCain and Joseph Lieberman, are lining up behind the idea of mandatory reductions as the only effective answer to warming. They would like nothing better than to see Mr. Bush at the head of this parade, but so far he shows no inclination even to join it.</p>
