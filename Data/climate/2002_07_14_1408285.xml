        <p>They trespass on our golf courses, foul our pools and squabble in the yard, but do they actually deserve the gas chamber?</p>
        <p>Answering complaints about Canada geese, state and federal officials have changed their strategy. In the past, wildlife experts herded them up and transported geese to open areas, shook their eggs to prevent them from hatching or let loose trained collies to chase them away.</p>
        <p>But now there's a statewide death sentence. This year, New Jersey will destroy as many as 10,500 geese, up from 1,169 killed just two years ago. The method of choice this year is a truck-towed gas chamber, in which carbon dioxide is released to suffocate the birds.</p>
        <p>Two weeks ago, federal Department of Agriculture officials descended on Hanover's sewer plant, trapped 125 geese and sent them to the chamber. The birds, which had carpeted plant property with feces and feathers, were buried on the spot.</p>
        <p>The United States Humane Society and other animal rights groups have protested, saying that not all options to shoo birds away have been exhausted. Hunters wonder about the wastefulness of burying unwanted birds. Other states with euthanasia policies have butchered birds and sent them to kitchens in food banks.</p>
