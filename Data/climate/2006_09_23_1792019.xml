        <p>WAL-MART TO CUT PACKAGING -- Wal-Mart Stores announced a five-year program with its suppliers to help reduce overall packaging by 5 percent. In the latest step to polish its environmental record, Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, said it would begin the initiative in 2008, and it could help Wal-Mart save $3.4 billion in its own costs. In the five-year plan, Wal-Mart will push its 600,000 global suppliers to find more efficient packaging methods. It estimates total supplier savings of $11 billion.</p>
        <p>Wal-Mart said it would start working with suppliers in November to prepare for the changes. Last October, the company's chief executive, H. Lee Scott Jr., above, said Wal-Mart would become a leader in environmental issues with three goals: reducing waste to zero, moving toward using only renewable energy and offering more products made in a way that preserves the environment.</p>

        <p>AUTO SUPPLIERS MAKE CUTS -- Production cuts among American automakers are rippling through the supplier industry, with BorgWarner saying yesterday that it would eliminate 13 percent of its North American work force and Lear earlier this week cutting its sales forecast by $300 million.</p>
        <p>General Motors, Ford Motor and the Chrysler Group division of DaimlerChrysler are losing market share to Asian automakers at the same time that the American economy is softening and domestic car sales are slowing.</p>
        <p>Shares of BorgWarner, based in Auburn Hills, Mich., fell 73 cents, to $53.76. Lear, based in Southfield, Mich., fell 23 cents, to $18.38. (AP)</p>
        <p>BOSTON SCIENTIFIC ISSUES WARNING -- Boston Scientific warned that its third-quarter profit would fall short of analysts' expectations, setting off a 9 percent decline in its share price and driving its stock to a four-year low. The warning prompted several Wall Street analysts to downgrade their recommendations on the stock and raise concerns about cash flow at the company, which took on about $9 billion in debt this year when it acquired the Guidant Corporation.</p>
        <p>In its warning, Boston Scientific said it expected third-quarter profit, excluding acquisition charges and other one-time items, of 15 cents to 19 cents a share and sales of $1.97 billion to $2.04 billion. Analysts had forecast a profit of 26 cents a share on revenue of $2.16 billion.</p>

        <p>COLA BAN OVERTURNED IN INDIA -- The High Court in India overturned a ban on the production and sale of Coca-Cola and Pepsi soft drinks in the southern Indian state of Kerala, but state officials said they would seek ways to challenge the decision. Kerala's government imposed the statewide ban after a New Delhi-based private research group, the Center for Science and Environment, contended that the soft drinks contained high levels of pesticides.</p>
        <p>On Friday, the High Court upheld an argument by the Indian divisions of Coca-Cola and PepsiCo that the state government had no jurisdiction to impose a ban on the manufacture and sale of their products. Only the federal government can ban food products, it ruled.</p>
        <p>Coca-Cola shares fell 21 cents, to $43.99, while PepsiCo shares lost 33 cents, to $64.28. (AP)</p>
        <p>MERCK QUESTIONS JUROR'S TIES  -- A judge granted Merck lawyers access to bank and cellphone records that could show the extent of a juror's financial relationship with a plaintiff who won a $32 million verdict in the death of a man who took the painkiller Vioxx. The juror, Jose Manuel Rios, who earns $22,000 a year as a school janitor, testified in a posttrial deposition that he borrowed up to $10,000 interest-free from Felicia Garza, the plaintiff in the lawsuit against Merck. He said the loans included $2,500 that was paid off just weeks before jury selection in the case.</p>
        <p>He and other jurors in April found Merck liable for 71-year-old Leonel Garza's fatal heart attack. Tilden Katz, a spokesman for Merck's legal team, has said that Merck's lawyers were hoping the documents would help them ''get to the bottom of'' the financial relationship. Joe Escobedo, a lawyer for the plaintiff, did not immediately return a call for comment. (AP)</p>
        <p>SONY CUTS PRICE FOR PS3 -- Sony cut the price of its PlayStation 3 in Japan by about 20 percent, responding to complaints that it cost twice as much as consoles from Microsoft and Nintendo. The game player will retail for 49,980 yen ($430) when it goes on sale on Nov. 11, Ken Kutaragi, the head of Sony Computer Entertainment, said at the Tokyo Game Show. The company previously said it would sell the cheapest model for 59,800 yen, excluding tax.</p>
        <p>Shares of Sony fell 1.9 percent, to 4,770 yen. The stock has declined 12 percent in the last six months. (BLOOMBERG NEWS)</p>
        <p>MTV TO BUY GAME DEVELOPER -- The MTV unit of Viacom agreed to buy Harmonix Music Systems, a developer of video games like Guitar Hero, for $175 million to expand its interactive and digital businesses. Investors in the closely held Harmonix may be eligible for additional payments through 2008 if financial results exceed certain targets, MTV, based in New York, said in a statement.</p>
        <p>MTV and Harmonix will develop products for MTV's online and mobile businesses, a spokeswoman, Marnie Black, said. MTV's games unit has featured Guitar Hero in TV programs and promotions since last November. Harmonix will be part of MTV's music and logo unit, led by Jeff Yapp, an executive vice president, the company said.</p>
        <p>Viacom's Class B shares rose 3 cents, to $37.03. They have dropped 10 percent this year. (BLOOMBERG NEWS)</p>
        <p>DUTCH PHONE COMPANY IN BUYBACK -- The Dutch government said it would sell its remaining 8 percent stake in the phone company Royal KPN to cut the national debt. Royal KPN agreed to buy back around half of the stake for 800 million euros ($1.02 billion), KPN said in a statement. The government is selling a total of 167 million shares.</p>
        <p>KPN's buyback is part of a larger repurchasing program the company is pursuing this year, totaling 1.56 billion euros. The government's sale completes the privatization of KPN, which went public in 1994. (AP)</p>
