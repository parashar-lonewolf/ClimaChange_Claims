        <p>FICTION &amp; POETRY</p>
        <p>ABOUT A BOY. By Nick Hornby. (Riverhead, $22.95.) A funny, intelligent, generous novel in which an incompetent man and an impossible youth learn to depend on each other.</p>
        <p>ALIENS OF AFFECTION. By Padgett Powell. (Holt, $22.50.) A collection of stories about characters who reject the bland conformity of contemporary life.</p>
        <p>THE ALL-TRUE TRAVELS AND ADVENTURES OF LIDIE NEWTON. By Jane Smiley. (Knopf, $26.) A historical novel of both action and ideas, whose heroine, a determined abolitionist, sets out to subvert slavery in person before the Civil War.</p>
        <p>AN AMERICAN KILLING. By Mary-Ann Tirone Smith. (Marian Wood/Holt, $23.) In the author's fifth novel, a Washington true-crime writer investigates the death of her lover and discovers the modern face of evil.</p>
        <p>AND BOTH SHALL ROW: A Novella and Stories. By Beth Lordan. (Picador USA, $21.) A collection, in an assured and distinctive voice, about relentlessly unglamorous characters whose experiences go beyond words and cannot be named, though Lordan is able to describe them.</p>
        <p>THE ANTELOPE WIFE. By Louise Erdrich. (Harper Flamingo, $24.) Multiple intertwined narratives and similar family relations shape this novel of bliss and bale among American Indians on the big bleak prairie.</p>
        <p>THE ARCHIVIST. By Martha Cooley. (Little, Brown, $22.95.) Engagement with historic evil (the Holocaust) and rejection or avoidance of the past are the poles of this absorbing first novel.</p>
        <p>ARK BABY. By Liz Jensen. (Overlook, $24.95.) The author's disorderly second novel satirically examines Darwinism, progress and the notion of scientific certainty through 150 years of Britain.</p>
        <p>ARMADILLO. By William Boyd. (Knopf, $24.) Everything goes wrong for the hero of Boyd's latest novel, an Englishman of Gypsy descent who discovers zemblanity (the opposite of serendipity) in today's multicultural London hustle.</p>
        <p>AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF RED: A Novel in Verse. By Anne Carson. (Knopf, $23.) A compulsively readable hybrid work by a scholar and poet who reimagines a lost Greek poem into a destructive love affair between Hercules and an American boy who is also (somehow) a winged red monster.</p>
        <p>bad chemistry. By Gary Krist. (Random House, $24.) Featuring a headless body, inflammable dogs, a 14-year-old sleuthing techno-nerd and Beatrix Potter, this first novel is as much a meditation on the power of secrets as it is a detective story.</p>
        <p>BARNEY POLAN'S GAME: A Novel of the 1951 College Basketball Scandals. By Charley Rosen. (Seven Stories, $23.95.) Barney, a sports columnist for The Brooklyn Sentinel, is an old-fashioned guy, a would-be novelist whose misfortune is excessive proximity to his material when the corruptions of the gray 1950's arrive.</p>
        <p>BARNEY'S VERSION. By Mordecai Richler. (Knopf, $25.) Like much of Richler's fiction, this novel seeks to evaluate Jewishness, Canadianhood and the struggle for personal integrity; but this time it's told by a hero whose memory is failing, making the moral task all the harder.</p>
        <p>BECH AT BAY: A Quasi-Novel. By John Updike. (Knopf, $23.) The third, quite possibly the last, of Updike's Bech satires, starring, since 1970, the Jewish anti-Updike who incarnated aspects of the literary scenery when the real Updike was still liable to being written off as a provincial WASP.</p>
        <p>BERTRAM COPE'S YEAR. By Henry Blake Fuller. (Turtle Point, paper, $14.95.) Written and self-published by a Chicago novelist nearly 80 years ago, this elegant satirical novel deals with lots of illicit sex without saying anything naughty.</p>
        <p>BIG GIRLS DON'T CRY. By Fay Weldon. (Atlantic Monthly, $24.) With her usual sly wit, the author uses the history of a feminist publishing house to ponder if the women's movement was worth all the bother.</p>
        <p>BIRTHDAY LETTERS. By Ted Hughes. (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $20.) A collection of poems by Sylvia Plath's widower, who himself died this year, but not before giving his side of their tempestuous relationship.</p>
        <p>THE BLACK FLOWER: A Novel of the Civil War. By Howard Bahr. (Owl/Holt, paper, $12.) The malignity of war is captured with post-Vietnam graphic ferocity in this novel about a group of Mississippi soldiers who are much worse than decimated in an assault on a Federal line.</p>
        <p>BLINDNESS. By Jose Saramago. (Harcourt Brace, $22.) A novel by this year's Nobel laureate in literature, written in polyphonic paragraphs; in it, a plague of contagious blindness is harrowing far beyond its allegorical function of inability or unwillingness to see.</p>
        <p>BLIZZARD OF ONE: Poems. By Mark Strand. (Knopf, $21.) A distinguished contemporary sets the purity of his language against an essentially godless, Wallace Stevensish universe that returns our examination with a blank stare.</p>
        <p>BLUE LIGHT. By Walter Mosley. (Little, Brown, $24.) The author abandons Easy Rawlins in favor of a quasi-science-fictional meditation about race relations.</p>
        <p>BODY PARTS: Stories. By Jere Hoar. (University Press of Mississippi, $26.) Mythologies and manners of the 20th-century American South, by a keen and fearless observer -- brave enough to live in Faulkner's Oxford and cheeky enough to create an entirely new Snopes.</p>
        <p>THE BOY. By Naeem Murr. (Houghton Mifflin, $22.) A man seeks out his abandoned illegitimate son and has the bad luck to find him in this dark, intelligent novel that evokes the damage scared people can do either by accident or by design.</p>
        <p>BRAIN STORM. By Richard Dooling. (Random House, $25.) A tightly packed thriller whose hero, a lawyer who justifiably hates his loathsome client, becomes sexually involved with a reductive brain researcher who can explain anything away.</p>
        <p>Bridget jones's diary. By Helen Fielding. (Viking, $22.95.) Though this novel's hilarious British heroine ruthlessly monitors her incoming calories (most from alcohol), she still knows the anguish of dateless Saturdays and unwaxed legs.</p>
        <p>BRINGING OUT THE DEAD. By Joe Connelly. (Knopf, $23.) A first novel about a paramedic who is driven to despair by the devastation he witnesses.</p>
        <p>CARTESIAN SONATA: And Other Novellas. By William H. Gass. (Knopf, $24.) The philosopher-novelist continues his challenge to conventional fictional forms.</p>
        <p>CAVEDWELLER. By Dorothy Allison. (Dutton, $24.95.) A rock-and-roll singer returns home to Georgia and the children she abandoned, in the second novel by the author of ''Bastard Out of Carolina.''</p>
        <p>CELEBRATION. By Harry Crews. (Simon &amp; Schuster, $23.) In his 16th novel, Crews ponders the effect of a voluptuous teen-ager named Too Much on a retirees' trailer park.</p>
        <p>CHARMING BILLY. By Alice McDermott. (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $22.) A life distorted by a lie, and by the expectations of others, is the matter of this eloquent, unsettling novel, set among Irish-Americans in New York; the winner of a National Book Award in 1998.</p>
        <p>CITIES OF THE PLAIN: Volume 3, ''The Border Trilogy.'' By Cormac McCarthy. (Knopf, $24.) The concluding volume of the current cowboy saga by this stubborn, long-winded, fascinating writer (many of his characters are like that too).</p>
        <p>THE COAST OF GOOD INTENTIONS: Stories. By Michael Byers. (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, paper, $12.) Gently resigned stories, melancholy and hopeful at once, about loss and accommodation in the lives of very different kinds of people.</p>
        <p>COLLECTED FICTIONS. By Jorge Luis Borges. (Viking, $40.) The first complete English version of all the fictional work of the father of magic realism in a single voice, that of Andrew Hurley, a professor of English at the University of Puerto Rico.</p>
        <p>CORDELIA UNDERWOOD: Or the Marvelous Beginnings of the Moosepath League. By Van Reid. (Viking, $24.95.) An amiable and richly inhabited first novel, re-creating Maine in the summer of 1896, when people were cheerier, wild animals tamer and villains more innocuous than now.</p>
        <p>CUPID AND DIANA. By Christina Bartolomeo. (Scribner, $22.) A wry and provoking novel, set in Washington, in which, for a change, it's the women (including the narrator) who are into cheating, infidelity and the sacrifice of love to business.</p>
        <p>DAMASCUS GATE. By Robert Stone. (Houghton Mifflin, $26.) A pyrophoric mix of extreme religious persuasions explodes in the face of Stone's skeptical hero in Jerusalem's Old City.</p>
        <p>DEATH IN SUMMER. By William Trevor. (Viking, $23.95.) The child of a man who has never known love is abducted by a woman who longs for love with something like madness in this novel by an author expert in malformations of the heart.</p>
        <p>THE DOWER HOUSE. By Annabel Davis-Goff. (St. Martin's, $22.95.) Snobbery, need, coldness, inertia and purposelessness intersect in this frankly old-fashioned novel about the Anglo-Irish aristocracy, living on leftovers in the 20th century.</p>
        <p>DREAMER. By Charles Johnson. (Scribner, $23.) A novel that illuminates the life and work of Martin Luther King Jr. by exploring the soul of an ordinary man who is King's physical double.</p>
        <p>DUSK. By F. Sionil Jose. (Modern Library, paper, $12.95.) A microhistorical novel in which the author, focusing on the trials of a single family, educates the reader in Philippine history and in how the people of that country see themselves.</p>
        <p>ENDURING LOVE. By Ian McEwan. (Nan A. Talese/Doubleday, $23.95.) Another eerie novel by the author of ''The Cement Garden''; this time the tour de force involves a science writer who is the victim, or beneficiary, of a homoerotic religious obsession he has done nothing to deserve.</p>
        <p>THE ENGRAFTED WORD: Poems. By Karl Kirchwey. (Marian Wood/Holt, cloth, $23; Owl/Holt, paper, $13.) Typically steeped in myth, history and literature (without neglecting doses of sensuality), these poems propose that the transformative word of poetry can save souls.</p>
        <p>EUCALYPTUS. By Murray Bail. (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $23.) A magic novel from Australia, in which a homesteader's daughter must marry, fairy tale fashion, the first suitor who can correctly identify every eucalyptus species; a wandering storyteller breaks the rule.</p>
        <p>EVENING. By Susan Minot. (Knopf, $23.) An elegant, assured novel that tells the story of a woman's life in two narratives: one as she remembers her life, one as she passes from it.</p>
        <p>THE EVERLASTING STORY OF NORY. By Nicholson Baker. (Random House, $22.) The novelist turns his magnifier on the mentation of a 9-year-old girl protagonist; the details, and the comedy they yield, are sharp and clear.</p>
        <p>THE EVOLUTION OF JANE. By Cathleen Schine. (Houghton Mifflin, $24.) A woman named Jane and the elements of evolution are both shrewdly rendered in a novel that unconventionally uses large principles to illuminate a particular life.</p>
        <p>THE FARMING OF BONES. By Edwidge Danticat. (Soho, $23.) A sobering novel by a Haitian-American, set in Hispaniola in 1937 during a bloody eruption of the endless hostility between Haiti and its neighbor, the Dominican Republic.</p>
        <p>THE FARM SHE WAS. By Ann Mohin. (Bridge Works, $22.95.) A novel about farm life that is a celebration of sounds and sensations.</p>
        <p>FINAL VINYL DAYS: And Other Stories. By Jill McCorkle. (Algonquin, $18.95.) Exasperating characters treated with knowing humor are the marks of this collection of stories.</p>
        <p>FLYING LEAP: Stories. By Judy Budnitz. (Picador USA, $20.) A first collection, by a 26-year-old cartoonist for The Village Voice; her narratives are bold enough to posit a man in a dog suit who is able to pass, or a high school pep squad that immolates itself out of sheer enthusiasm.</p>
        <p>Freedomland. By Richard Price. (Broadway, $25.) In an almost obsessively realistic novel that echoes the Susan Smith case, long-simmering racial tensions erupt in a New Jersey city after a dazed and bleeding white woman claims her 4-year-old son was abducted by a black carjacker.</p>
        <p>GAIN. By Richard Powers. (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $25.) An erudite, penetrating novel that deals with the evolution of American industry and commercial practice over two centuries, and with one of its casualties, a woman who (rightly or wrongly) blames chemicals for her cancer.</p>
        <p>GERTRUDE OF STONY ISLAND AVENUE. By James Purdy. (Morrow, $19.95.) In Purdy's 16th novel, a woman researches the life of her late daughter, a sexually flamboyant artist.</p>
        <p>GETTING IT IN THE HEAD: Stories. By Mike McCormack. (Holt, $23.) An Irish writer's first collection; funny, fantastical tales that trample inventively on the toes of sanctimonious news media, provincial pride and the 20th century itself.</p>
        <p>GHOST TOWN. By Robert Coover. (Holt, $24.) The master of hypertext flings cinematic cliches into the fever-dream narration of a nameless cowpoke's misadventures as he bears his solitude through a terrain of dry rocks and dead things.</p>
        <p>THE GIANT, O'BRIEN. By Hilary Mantel. (Marian Wood/ Holt, $22.) An early mad scientist meets a late, unviable, enormous Irish spinner of tales in a novel that grants the future to the scientist but the heart to the bard.</p>
        <p>THE GIRL IN THE FLAMMABLE SKIRT: Stories. By Aimee Bender. (Doubleday, $21.95.) Confused, libidinous young women who aren't sure what they want or how to get it are frequent in the population of this insouciant first collection.</p>
        <p>GLORIE. By Caryn James. (Zoland, $24.) A novel, by the chief television critic of The Times, that investigates character and the fear of loss through its widowed octogenarian protagonist's struggle to avoid selling her home.</p>
        <p>GOD IS MY BROKER: A Monk-Tycoon Reveals the 7 Laws of Spiritual and Financial Growth. By Brother Ty with Christopher Buckley and John Tierney. (Random House, $20.) A fictional sendup of self-help, by two experienced senduppers.</p>
        <p>GOING FAST: Poems. By Frederick Seidel. (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $22.) With an eye on the millennium, Seidel aims his astute, ironic wit at targets like nuclear testing, technocracy and vanished pleasures; but he still loves New York.</p>

        <p>Groundwork. by Robert Welch. (Blackstaff/Dufour, paper, $19.95.) The essence of the Irish experience, distilled into a masterly family saga encompassing four centuries and 22 characters; a kinship chart is thoughtfully provided.</p>
        <p>THE HALF-LIFE OF HAPPINESS. By John Casey. (Knopf, $25.) This spacious novel's hypersensitive and often uncharitable narrator analyzes the failure of her parents' marriage as her mother falls in love with another woman and her father grows becalmed in the everyday.</p>
        <p>THE HANDSOME SAILOR. By Larry Duberstein. (Permanent Press, $25.) Herman Melville is the hero of this novel, which summons in lyrical detail the Victorian New York he lived in after his commercial and critical failure as a writer. There are love affairs, but not with a sailor.</p>
        <p>THE HEALING. By Gayl Jones. (Beacon, $23.) A wry and funny novel in which violence and paranoia are banished by a kind of faith that is happy with illogic and depends (like analysis) on free association toward insight.</p>
        <p>HEMINGWAY'S CHAIR. By Michael Palin. (Thomas Dunne/St. Martin's, $23.95.) Written by a former member of Monty Python's Flying Circus, this novel tells the story of a sweet-tempered, prudish postal worker who suddenly goes batty.</p>

        <p>HOURMASTER. By Christophe Bataille. (New Directions, $17.95.) A French novelist's fable without a moral, in which 218 clocks drown out the hiss of nothingness in an isolated seaside castle.</p>
        <p>THE HOURS. By Michael Cunningham. (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $22.) A delicate, subtle, perhaps eerie novel with three parallel stories: one that echoes Virginia Woolf's ''Mrs. Dalloway,'' one involving Woolf herself and one about an American woman who reads ''Mrs. Dalloway.''</p>
        <p>THE HOUSE GUN. By Nadine Gordimer. (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $24.) An elegantly conceived political novel of physical violence and spiritual turmoil that assault a liberal white family in post-apartheid South Africa.</p>
        <p>THE HOUSE OF SLEEP. By Jonathan Coe. (Knopf, $24.) A witty, intricate novel (Coe's second) whose four chief characters live in engaging, unpredictable communion with dreams.</p>
        <p>HULLABALOO IN THE GUAVA ORCHARD. By Kiran Desai. (Atlantic Monthly, $22.) Chaos -- perhaps intended to stand for the larger chaos of India itself -- is the prevailing mode in this lively, imaginative novel about a cracked youth who becomes an object of worship in his hometown.</p>
        <p>ICY SPARKS. By Gwyn Hyman Rubio. (Viking, $24.95.) Icy, the hyperarticulate heroine of this first novel, struggles with her personal handicaps (she's an orphan with Tourette's syndrome) in a world that's in no hurry to help her out.</p>
        <p>IDENTITY. By Milan Kundera. (HarperCollins, $23.) The naive hero sends anonymous love letters to his lover, setting off events that illuminate their psychological obsessions and miscommunication.</p>

        <p>I MARRIED A COMMUNIST. By Philip Roth. (Houghton Mifflin, $26.) A tender, harsh, witty novel whose title refers to a bitter, hostile book written by the female half of a ruined marriage (sound familiar?), and whose principal action, recalled in the present, takes place in the dire focus of the age of McCarthyism.</p>
        <p>IN ANOTHER PLACE, NOT HERE. By Dionne Brand. (Grove, $24.) A first novel, passionately attentive to nuance, that explores the transit between the Caribbean and North America through a love affair between two women.</p>
        <p>INGRATITUDE. By Ying Chen. (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $20.) This author's third novel, short, resolute and tightly strung, is narrated from the grave by a woman who killed herself in order to make her mother suffer (and to make a point about women in traditional Chinese culture).</p>
        <p>THE INLAND ICE: And Other Stories. By Eilis Ni Dhuibhne. (Blackstaff/Dufour, paper, $16.95.) Fiction, graced with head-versus-heart knowingness, about people on whom Ireland imposes timid choices and straitened lives.</p>
        <p>AN INSTANCE OF THE FINGERPOST. By Iain Pears. (Riverhead, $27.) This intricate literary thriller, elaborately plotted and superlatively researched, casts real Restoration figures in a mystery about the murder of an Oxford don (and a much greater crime to which it is adjoined).</p>
        <p>THE IRON TRACK. By Aharon Appelfeld. (Schocken, $21.) Tracing for some 40 years the vanished outposts of Jewish life in central Europe, Appelfeld's narrator and protagonist compresses big themes of revenge, recovery and the weight of history into this short Israeli novel.</p>
        <p>JACK MAGGS. By Peter Carey. (Knopf, $24.) A sly, enticing, sophisticated sort of paranovel, in which the characters are fun-house images of real and imaginary people in the life and work of Dickens, especially those associated with ''Great Expectations.''</p>
        <p>KAATERSKILL FALLS. By Allegra Goodman. (Dial, $23.95.) Little actually happens in this first novel, but the author discovers form and sensibility in the small excitements and grand rhythms of life in an Orthodox Jewish community.</p>
        <p>KALIMANTAAN. By C. S. Godshalk. (Marian Wood/Holt, $25.) A formidably imaginative first novel in which a man's idealized love for his dead mother powers British imperialism in Borneo.</p>
        <p>KAROO. By Steve Tesich. (Harcourt Brace, $24.) A Hollywood script doctor destroys another man's great film to further a personal agenda in this posthumous novel by the screenwriter of ''Breaking Away.''</p>
        <p>THE KNIFE THROWER: And Other Stories. By Steven Millhauser. (Crown, $22.) Stories whose characters -- dreamers, artists, illusionists -- all run to excess as the author explores our responses to the products and projections of our own minds.</p>
        <p>THE LADIES FROM ST. PETERSBURG: Three Novellas. By Nina Berberova. (New Directions, $19.95.) A posthumous collection, characterized by lucid prose, deft characterization and an unromantic gaze at the author's Russian homeland.</p>
        <p>THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND. By Giles Foden. (Knopf, $25.) The nonhero of this ambitious first novel is a Scottish doctor whose consciousness of his moral mediocrity doesn't enable him to separate himself from his employer, the Ugandan dictator Idi Amin.</p>
        <p>THE LAST RESORT. By Alison Lurie. (Holt, $22.) The place the world ends in this sparkling, smart novel is Key West, where a number of exemplary type characters have to stop and wait for whatever they are running from to catch up.</p>
        <p>LEAVING EARTH. By Helen Humphreys. (Metropolitan/Holt, $22.) A novel, by a Canadian poet, in which two women try to set a record for endurance flying; as the days mount, the real world recedes from the view of the world aloft.</p>
        <p>LEONARDO'S HORSE. By R. M. Berry. (FC2 Press, paper, $13.95.) Leonardo da Vinci is cast as a failure, a great prodigy of little accomplishment, in a novel-within-this-novel (the fictitious author, an academic, isn't doing so well himself).</p>
        <p>LIKE NEVER BEFORE. By Ehud Havazelet. (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $23.) Tense, unpredictable short stories about two Jewish generations; their principal themes include the unforgivingness of time and the wasting of love.</p>
        <p>THE LONG FALLING. By Keith Ridgway. (Houghton Mifflin, $22.) An Irish writer's first novel, which turns the quite understandable murder of a truly horrible husband into a meditation over whether taking another's life is ever justifiable.</p>
        <p>LOST IN TRANSLATION. By Nicole Mones. (Delacorte, $23.95.) An American bigot's daughter becomes entranced with Chinese culture and Chinese men in a first novel that inspects two great cultures and their invincible convictions of superiority to each other.</p>
        <p>LOST LAKE: Stories. By Mark Slouka. (Knopf, $21.) Beautiful and mysterious fiction with a dreamlike sense of life in death and death in life, set in a summer community in upstate New York.</p>
        <p>a lover's almanac. By Maureen Howard. (Viking, $24.95.) Taking as her model the ''Old Farmer's Almanac,'' the novelist plumbs the shallows of millennial irrationality as she follows two young members of Generation X into the year 2000.</p>
        <p>Loves that bind. by Julian Rios. (Knopf, $24.) In this epistolary novel first published in Spain, the narrator dreamily chronicles a slew of past sexual encounters in a series of letters to his (current) beloved, for whom he is searching in London. Beloved's response is not recorded.</p>
