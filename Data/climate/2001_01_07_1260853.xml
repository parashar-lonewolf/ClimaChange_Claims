        <p>THE Attack of the Number Crunchers has begun, but don't worry. Even those of you who are intimidated by statistics -- which is to say, virtually all of you -- can survive it, using the simple system delineated here.</p>
        <p>The crunch in question is the data from the 2000 census. The first batch, the total head count for New Jersey and the rest of the country, was released last week with great fanfare. (For the record, the numbers showed that New Jersey grew 8.9 percent in the last decade, which in layman's terms means that if you weighed 150 pounds in 1990, you weigh 163 pounds today.) More data will be parceled out as the year progresses -- about what color we are, how much money we make, what we do for a living -- until eventually we know almost as much about ourselves as we know about Madonna's sex life.</p>

        <p>THE Attack of the Number Crunchers has begun, but don't worry. Even those of you who are intimidated by statistics -- which is to say, virtually all of you -- can survive it, using the simple system delineated here.</p>
        <p>The crunch in question is the data from the 2000 census. The first batch, the total head count for New Jersey and the rest of the country, was released last week with great fanfare. (For the record, the numbers showed that New Jersey grew 8.9 percent in the last decade, which in layman's terms means that if you weighed 150 pounds in 1990, you weigh 163 pounds today.) More data will be parceled out as the year progresses -- about what color we are, how much money we make, what we do for a living -- until eventually we know almost as much about ourselves as we know about Madonna's sex life.</p>
        <p>The problem is, this information will be delivered primarily by bureaucrats and professors and will thus be full of technical terms like ''percentage'' and ''congressional reapportionment,'' making it as incomprehensible as it is boring. That is why I spent almost an entire coffee break developing a simple method for dealing with the avalanche of figures headed our way. I call it the Party of 10 System(R). If you prefer, you can call it the Idea I Stole From One of Those Chain E-Mail Letters.</p>
        <p>It works like this: Imagine that there are 10 guests at a party and that the guests perfectly represent the demographics of New Jersey. So, starting with the obvious, five would be male, five female. Every time new census statistics come your way, your mental picture of the guests can get more detailed. For instance, the next data might tell us that six of the guests are New Jersey natives (that's what the 1990 census showed) or that all but two are white (again, 1990).</p>
        <p>The chain e-mail that inspired the Party of 10 System(R) used a similar gimmick to describe the world's population, except with a base of 100 and a heavy dose of moralizing. (''Seventy of the people would be nonwhite, 30 would be white; 89 would be heterosexual, 11 would be homosexual; 6 would possess 59 percent of the entire world's wealth, and all 6 would be from the United States.'') The intent seemed to be to make recipients pause and think, and it certainly worked. Mostly what I paused and thought was that I should stop reading irksome chain e-mails.</p>
        <p>Anyway, one beauty of the Party of 10 System(R) is that it lets you make quick, clear comparisons across decades or even centuries, without having to account for inflation, leap years, etc. This can dramatically underscore important social trends.</p>
        <p>For instance, history books suggest that had our imaginary party convened back in 1820, only one of the 10 guests would have been able to read. Had our party convened three weeks ago, however, virtually all of the guests would have been able to read, yet not a single one would have heard of Donald DiWhatshisname, the guy who's going to be our governor for the next year.</p>
        <p>Similarly, in 1990 the party of 10 would have included 3 people under the age of 21. A century ago, in contrast, 4 of the guests would have been children but, remarkably, none would have been named Britney, Britany or Brittanie.</p>
        <p>I've taken the liberty of developing some Party of 10(R) projections using 1990 figures, interviews with experts and impressions I've developed by eavesdropping on people at the supermarket. The full census figures, when released, will almost surely show these things about the 10 party guests:</p>
        <p>* Six will be in the work force. Four of those will drive to work alone; none will feel guilty about it.</p>
        <p>* Three will have at least some college education; none will understand how this whole electricity-deregulation thing works.</p>
        <p>* Eight will be ''somewhat concerned'' or ''very concerned'' about global warming. Nine will think it's been ''too danged cold'' this winter.</p>
        <p>* One will have been born in a foreign country. Seven will live in the same houses they lived in five years ago. Nine will experience occasional wanderlust but will not act on it because going to Newark Airport scares them.</p>
        <p>* One will have been the victim of a crime in the last year. Eight will have turned up at that casting call last summer for bit parts in ''The Sopranos.''</p>
        <p>* Six will attend some form of religious service at least occasionally, but all 10 will agree with this, from Horace: ''We are just statistics, born to consume resources.''</p>
