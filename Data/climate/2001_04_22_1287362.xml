        <p>Last month, the United States rejected the Kyoto Protocol, which seeks to limit global warming by reducing carbon dioxide emissions, because, according to President Bush, it would hurt American industry. But American car makers, copying the methods of their European counterparts, have begun to replace fiberglass with natural plant fibers anyway. Using such fibers can save much of the energy needed to make a car and result in parts that are 40 percent lighter -- and biodegradable. By 2010, the New Jersey consulting firm Kline &amp; Company expects natural fibers to replace a fifth of the fiberglass in today's automobile interiors.</p>
        <p>WHAT'S THAT SMELL? In North America, plant stalks replaced 2 percent of the fiberglass in mats, seat backs and other plastic composites last year; hemp dominated this field. The crop is at least 65 cents cheaper per pound than fiberglass; it also grows perennially and can be recycled easily. In breadbasket states, lawmakers are examining industrial hemp production as a way of boosting farm income. Too bad it's a controlled substance. The Illinois legislature approved financing for a study earlier this year (though the governor vetoed it), and the Nebraska legislature is debating legalization.</p>

        <p>WHAT'S THAT SMELL? In North America, plant stalks replaced 2 percent of the fiberglass in mats, seat backs and other plastic composites last year; hemp dominated this field. The crop is at least 65 cents cheaper per pound than fiberglass; it also grows perennially and can be recycled easily. In breadbasket states, lawmakers are examining industrial hemp production as a way of boosting farm income. Too bad it's a controlled substance. The Illinois legislature approved financing for a study earlier this year (though the governor vetoed it), and the Nebraska legislature is debating legalization.</p>
        <p>WHAT'S THE HARM? One problem, but a big one: even though the stalks have negligible narcotic effects, the Drug Enforcement Agency almost always views growing industrial hemp -- cannabis, after all -- as tantamount to growing weed. Susie Dugan, the executive director of the antidrug group Pride Omaha, insists that industrial hemp licenses would give cover to pot peddlers and that drug-prevention activists would have to warn others about the hemp car's drug-promoting message.</p>
        <p>WHAT ELSE IS GROWING? It is the use of natural fibers in car doors and trunks that would constitute the real engineering triumph -- and car makers are getting there. A company called Indiana Bio-Composites will make a recyclable exterior panel for a mobile home from kenaf, a cordlike hibiscus, in the next two years. Nick Tucker, a University of Warwick researcher, is working to convert a nine-foot-tall crop known as elephant grass into a tough material fit for biodegradable car bodies by 2006. If the plants fail, all is not lost on the reduced-emissions front. G.M., in partnership with Hormel, recently brewed up GMBond, a nontoxic mold for casting metals, from ''turkey and pork byproducts.''</p>
