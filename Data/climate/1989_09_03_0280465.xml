        <p>LEAD: ANYONE who is a transportation expert has heard, time and again, from people who have ridden on the fast Japanese Shinkansen or the faster French Train a Grande Vitesse, called the T.G.V. ''Why can't we have that in America?'' they ask. My answer is: Because it's an outrageous boondoggle.

        <p>ANYONE who is a transportation expert has heard, time and again, from people who have ridden on the fast Japanese Shinkansen or the faster French Train a Grande Vitesse, called the T.G.V. ''Why can't we have that in America?'' they ask. My answer is: Because it's an outrageous boondoggle. With one possible exception, no high-speed rail system in this country could pay for itself, and the claimed external benefits - cleaner air, energy saved, eased pressure on airports - are nonexistent.''</p>
        <p>The top speed from Paris to Lyons on the T.G.V. is 170 miles per hour; on the Tokyo-Osaka-Hakata corridor it is 131 m.p.h. It is very costly to achieve these speeds. The line must be electrified, and the track must be almost straight and almost flat. Other than the New York-Washington line, on which electric Metroliners now run at 120 to 125 m.p.h. top, there is no track - at least no track serving a populous corridor - that meets the curve and grade standards for high-speed rail. With that exception, new, electrified right of way is an absolute prerequisite for high-speed rail.</p>
        <p>In a recent article in ''Technology Review,'' Louis Thompson, formerly in charge of rail passenger service at the Department of Transportation, observed that any investment estimate of less than $10 million to $20 million per mile for a new high-speed rail system is not credible. Jane Holt, a tranportation analyst, has concluded that a high-speed rail system in the United States would need 25 million riders a year to pay a 10 percent return on capital invested.</p>
        <p>So far, there are only two-high speed rail systems in the world with enough revenue to cover operating and capital cost: the Tokyo-Osaka-Hakata Shinkansen and the Paris-Lyons T.G.V. Annual ridership on Tokyo-Hakata is around 150 million. For Paris-Lyons it is about 17 million a year. The most heavily traveled inter-city corridor in America is New York-Washington, with a combined total of airline and Metroliner passengers of only 4.3 million a year.</p>
        <p>Cleaner air and energy savings are the external benefits most often cited for subsidizing high-speed rail. Let us look at them. First, electric trains, unless they draw from nuclear or hydroelectric power plants, burn fossil fuels. They burn less of it per seat-mile than cars or airplanes do, but the question is whether high-speed rail results in enough fewer cars or airplanes moving around to make a difference. Even heavy patronage of a high-speed rail system can increase fossil fuel use, if its effect is increased total travel without reducing car or air travel. Further, any effect would be very small, because the proportion of total travel that could take place on trains is tiny. In 1984, cars accounted for 91 percent of travel, planes for 8 percent and trains (including commuting) for just 0.2 percent.</p>
        <p>Two other points that are often mentioned as pluses for high-speed rail are airport congestion and inner-city revival. The latter stems from the notion that a new train station downtown with lots of travelers coming and going will do a lot for a run-down neighborhood. Perhaps it will, but there are a lot of true stories of downtown comebacks in this country that happened without a few billion dollars being thrown at a public works project out in the countryside.</p>
        <p>Realistically, the only airports that could be affected by high-speed rail are La Guardia in New York and Washington National. Since travel between these two cannot account for a very large percentage of total operations at either airport, the impact of high-speed rail might not be very great even if you eliminated all La Guardia-National flights. Further, as long as small planes with a few people on board are using airspace that could be used by big planes with a lot of people on board, and that is the case today, those airports are not being used to maximum efficiency. If they were being so used, and if the demand for landing rights drove short-haul air fares higher, then there might be a market for high-speed rail on the New York-Washington line.</p>
        <p>USING Ms. Holt's method of analysis on the New York-Washington corridor provides for interesting results. If the one-way train fare were $150 - 50 percent higher than the cost of Pan Am's air shuttle - high-speed rail is feasible with a yearly ridership of 5.8 million people. But 5.8 million people is a one-third increase over the current number of both Metroliner riders and air travelers. So if almost all New York-Washington air travelers switched to high-speed rail and there were growth in the market, this level of ridership might be attained. And if those conditions were met, maybe the economics would work.  If people have a high-speed rail project somewhere else in the country and they think they can recover its costs and offer a decent return on capital, let them raise the money for it. But if they say a little help from government is needed, beware. Someone is reaching for your wallet.</p>
