        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your readers should not be left with the impression that Alan Sokal has caught the editors of Social Text championing a disbelief in the existence of the physical universe (front page, May 18). There is every difference in the world between such nonsense and questioning, as we do, the scientific community's abuses of authority, its priestly organization and lack of accountability to the public.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your readers should not be left with the impression that Alan Sokal has caught the editors of Social Text championing a disbelief in the existence of the physical universe (front page, May 18). There is every difference in the world between such nonsense and questioning, as we do, the scientific community's abuses of authority, its priestly organization and lack of accountability to the public.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sokal claims that the work Social Text publishes "won't help us find an  effective treatment for AIDS or devise strategies for preventing global warming." He is wrong. It's exactly public interest critiques from outside science that have forced science to devote its often reluctant energies to such  low-profit areas in the past, and that we hope will help us avoid disastrous scientific irresponsibility in the future. This seems real enough to us. One would have expected that as a self-declared progressive, Mr. Sokal would have been glad to agree.</p>
