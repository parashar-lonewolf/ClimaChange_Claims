        <p>When President Bush named Rod Paige to be his education secretary six months ago, he chose a man from the Texas trenches, the superintendent of Houston schools who, it was said, would spread the practices that had raised achievement levels in his home state to the rest of the country, enjoying a central role on one of the new president's showcase issues.</p>
        <p>But as the White House rolled out its blueprint for education, it was presidential advisers who briefed the news media and Congress, not the education secretary. With the White House handling the Congressional negotiations over the education bill directly, the new secretary has been struggling to demonstrate his own significance.</p>
        <p>In an interview at his office, Dr. Paige said: ''Yesterday, I was coming out of the White House, and I said to myself, 'Here I am coming in and out of the White House just like it's routine.' A year ago, I would have thought this to be a strange aberration, and here I am moving through this thing like I belong here. And I do.  This is my place.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Paige's eagerness to define his role is not without cause. Before he had even settled into the house he had just bought in southwest Washington, the news magazine U.S. News &amp; World Report reported that Dr. Paige was humiliated by his apparent lack of a role in the Bush administration, and cited friends saying he planned to quit in disgust.</p>
        <p>In his department, there were complaints that his takeover had paralyzed the bureaucracy, when the new secretary demanded all hires, contracts and bills go through his office. On Capitol Hill, confirmations crawled at a tortuous pace, and for the first six months, the only Education Department appointments approved were his own and that of his deputy.</p>
        <p>''I was here a long time by myself,'' Dr. Paige said. ''I'm walking around in this building. I could throw a brick from one end to the other of the corridor and wouldn't hit a soul.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Paige now appears to be growing the thicker skin necessary for the local climate and says he is learning to survive the sniping, backbiting and second-guessing. ''I've tried to deal with it in several ways,'' he said. ''One was to try to debunk it, to say it's not true, but now I'm saying the hell with it, and going on and doing my job, which is the job of secretary of education, which is as much a part of the leadership function as it's ever been for any secretary.''</p>
        <p>For most of his first six months, Dr. Paige, 67, has been a diligent salesman for the president's education plan, speaking around the country before education administrators, business leaders and teachers' unions. But now Dr. Paige appears intent on cutting a higher profile here in Washington, and he says he has found his purpose. He describes it as introducing the classroom perspective to the discussions in Congress over financing schools, and holding the schools accountable for results. He is the first supervisor of a large urban school system and the first African-American to run the department.</p>
        <p>''I've found that niche that needs to be fulfilled, and grown from it, and found that's the contribution that I'm going to make,'' Dr. Paige said. ''To see that everybody knows that when schools are reformed, they'll be reformed by people in the school buildings, not in Washington.''</p>
        <p>Though nobody on Capitol Hill will admit it, the perspective from the classroom was glaringly absent as the two chambers formulated the education bill now under revision in  conference committee. The two legislative branches came up with federal standards for adequate student progress that proved unworkable, with studies later showing they would rank most public schools around the country, including those most successful in raising student achievement, as failures.</p>
        <p>In recent weeks, Dr. Paige has shown up to field questions from the news media before conference committee discussions on the education bill, and he has been conspicuously meeting with legislators. In those meetings, he said, ''It's clear that the point of view that was not taken into account was the practitioner's point of view.''</p>
        <p>But on Capitol Hill, his appearances have done little to quell the sense that any important changes on educational policy go through the White House, not the Education Department. Jack Jennings, director of the Center on Education Policy, a Washington-based study center, ranked Dr. Paige ''I, for irrelevant.''</p>
        <p>A key Congressional aide on education, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: ''He's bringing nothing. He's not part of the discussion. He's not the negotiator. He's not the guy things are cleared through.''</p>
        <p>The aide added that the White House's direct handling of the issue was more a matter of President Bush's political needs than anything else. The education plan was one of President Bush's premier campaign issues, and one he was unlikely to hand off to a cabinet member.</p>
        <p>''It is the No. 1 issue with the electorate, and I think the president wants it for himself,'' the aide said. ''It makes it difficult for the secretary to be anything other than an echo machine for the president.''</p>
        <p>Quite aside from education, the Bush administration has handled a raft of other issues directly from the White House or from Vice President Dick Cheney's office, from energy to taxes to the patient's bill of rights to the environment. Sometimes it has publicly contradicted cabinet members like Christie Whitman, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, who was stung when the president changed his stand on carbon dioxide emissions.</p>
        <p>Though he may have had to fight for his place in policy discussions, Dr. Paige insists he is at the table now. He rejects any suggestion that his importance in the job may be linked to racism. ''I never think in those terms,'' he said. Dr. Paige acknowledged, though, that other cabinet members have also had to take a back seat to the White House, but have not found themselves targeted as obsolete.</p>
        <p>In not overstepping his authority and announcing policy decisions himself, one higher education lobbyist said, Dr. Paige proved perhaps wiser than more practiced political hands. ''He didn't seem fooled coming in,'' the lobbyist said.</p>
