        <p>Iraqi Invitations to Palaces  President Saddam Hussein of Iraq invited foreign experts, but not U.N. inspectors, to live in his palaces for a month to refute American accusations that there are weapons hidden in any of them. United Nations officials do not view the offer as serious, and the commander of American forces in the Persian Gulf said that if he were ordered to attack, Mr. Hussein's personal security forces would be the first targets.</p>

        <p>Israel 'Humiliated' by Clinton  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the President's failure to meet him, during a recent visit ''humiliated'' Israel, but the White House says no snub was intended.</p>

        <p>Conspiracy Trial Begins in Paris  Nearly 40 people accused of helping Algerian Islamic militants plant bombs went on trial in Paris. The attacks killed 8 people and wounded 170. Prosecutors say the masterminds were two Algerian students. One will be tried separately; the other has eluded arrest.</p>

        <p>Canadian Victims Need Not Sue  A Canadian inquiry recommended that thousands of Canadians who contracted the AIDS virus and hepatitis C from contaminated blood should be compensated without having to file suit. The report criticizes health officials for delays in setting up new testing methods that would have detected the AIDS virus in donated blood earlier.</p>

        <p>Mexican Prisoner Gets Support  Amnesty International has called for the release of Joaquin Hernandez Galicia, former strongman of the extravagantly corrupt Mexican Petroleum Workers Union, listing him as a prisoner of conscience. Mr. Hernandez Galicia has criticized privatization of the state oil company.</p>

        <p>Kenyan Government Lifts Ban  Kenya lifted a ban on the liberal Safina party, clearing the way for it to field candidates in next month's general elections. The pro-democracy Safina party, which opposes President Daniel arap Moi's Government, sees the decision as a hollow victory, as it gives them only five weeks to organize a campaign.</p>

        <p>Bishop Testifies in South Africa  A Methodist bishop urged Winnie Madikizela-Mandela to reconcile with him as a step toward healing in post-apartheid South Africa. The former wife of President Nelson Mandela had tried to ruin the bishop with allegations of sexual abuse. The appeal followed testimony before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which is examining Mrs. Madikizela-Mandela's role in a dozen murders and many assaults.</p>

        <p>Court Takes Arts Case; Will Rule on 'Decency' Test  The long-running debate over Federal spending on the arts moved to the Supreme Court as the Justices agreed to rule on whether the Constitution permits Congress to make ''decency'' a test for the awarding of grants by the National Endowment for the Arts.</p>

        <p>Concerns at Nuclear Plant  Nuclear experts from utilities around the country have told Commonwealth Edison, the nation's largest private operator of reactors, that operations at its Zion plant near Chicago show serious weaknesses in safety management and a ''complete lack of progress'' in addressing its problems.</p>

        <p>Reno Falls Ill in Mexico  Attorney General Janet Reno cut short an official trip to Mexico after fainting at a reception on Tuesday and spending the night at a Mexico City hospital, where she complained of nausea and dizziness. Ms. Reno was found to have gallstones, although it was not clear whether that condition was related to the symptoms that led to her hospitalization. She felt well enough to check out of the hospital for a meeting with President Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico and a speech to a conference of prosecutors from the Western Hemisphere. And later, she flew to Florida, where she will spend Thanksgiving with her family.</p>

        <p>Cancer Resistance Studied  A new study describes a way to overcome the resistance cancer cells quickly develop when treated with many drugs. In experiments involving mice, researchers attacked the cells which build capillaries, a network of fine blood vessels that nurture fast-growing tumors. Those cells proved incapable of developing resistance.</p>

        <p>Lymphoma Treatment Seen  The Food and Drug Administration approved a new genetically engineered drug for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The drug, Rituxan, was shown in clinical trials to be comparable to chemotherapy in slowing progression of the disease, but with the advantage of fewer side effects.</p>

        <p>Pessimism on Climate Accord  Saying that criticisms by other countries of the United States' position on global warming are ''ill-founded,'' the Clinton Administration's new chief negotiator on a climate treaty acknowledged that it might not be possible to bridge the remaining differences with Europe and the developing world.</p>

        <p>Concern Over Capital's Police  Allegations this week of corruption in the District of Columbia's police force have led to another round of despair over the management of the nation's capital. The city's police chief, Larry D. Soulsby, resigned after a trouble-plagued 28 months as the head of a department awash in scandal over unsolved murders, hapless criminal investigations, lost evidence and excessive overtime.</p>

        <p>Upgrade Ordered on 747's After Flight 800 Inquiry  The Federal Aviation Administration ordered an immediate change in fuel pumps in Boeing 747's and also proposed a change in the wiring of older planes of that model, saying that tests conducted after the crash of T.W.A. Flight 800 pointed to both as potential causes of a mid-air explosion. An official with the F.A.A. said there is ''no evidence'' linking either problem to the explosion on Flight 800 last year, but that the agency believed it was ''prudent'' to make the changes.</p>

        <p>Food Pantries Seek Help  The directors of food pantries and social service agencies say there has been a significant increase in hunger in New York City since the end of summer, when Federal welfare law cut off thousands of immigrants from food stamps. Many assistance programs have begun to run out of food, and are cutting back their hours or preparing less expensive, meatless meals. City officials agreed to spend an extra $2 million to restock programs that have been running out of food. And Mayor Giuliani added $26 million to this year's budget to preserve food stamp benefits for 67,000 immigrants.</p>

        <p>Japanese Borrowing Stalls  Japanese banks found it increasingly difficult and expensive to borrow money despite an enormous injection of cash into the troubled financial system by the Bank of Japan. The problems faced by even relatively healthy banks heightened the sense of financial crisis and raised the possibility that they could be dragged into a credit squeeze that has engulfed three of their weaker competitors in the last two weeks.</p>
