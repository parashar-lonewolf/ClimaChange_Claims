        <p>THE push and shove over public policy is usually about who gets the license, the subsidy, the tax break. Occasionally ideology intrudes, as in "less government the better."

        <p>THE push and shove over public policy is usually about who gets the license, the subsidy, the tax break. Occasionally ideology intrudes, as in "less government the better." But the battle over environmental policy within the Clinton transition team is about something more elusive -- call it sensibility. And the first casualty may be Lawrence H. Summers, an economics superstar whose impolitic pronouncements on the environment could cost him a post in the Clinton White House.</p>
        <p>On one side are Vice President-elect Al Gore's senior advisers, spiritually committed environmentalists eager to move global warming and rain forest preservation to the top of the national agenda. On the other are economists and their fellow travelers, policy wonks never at a loss for a clever solution. And while there is no inherent conflict, the chemistry between the two groups is wretched. In fact, the infighting could leave President Clinton with a least-common-denominator environmental policy of good intentions and little effective action.</p>
        <p>Neither side identifies with the us-vs.-them environmentalism of the 1980's. The Gore camp has little patience with environmentalists who never met a businessman they liked -- or a regulation they didn't. For their part, the economists are at pains to distance themselves from polluters who mask bad citizenship in blather about putting people and jobs ahead of plants and animals.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the latest broadside on market-based environmentalism from the Progressive Policy Institute, the research arm of Bill Clinton's post-liberal Democratic Leadership Council, suggests the two sides have much in common. Written by Robert Stavins, an economist at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, and Thomas Grumbly, the head of Clean Sites, a nonprofit Virginia group that mediates hazardous waste cleanups, their chapter of the book "Mandate for Change" makes the case for aggressive environmentalism with a light economic touch.</p>
        <p>Like Senator Gore, Messrs. Stavins and Grumbly want to tax carbon fuels as an incentive to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. They agree that the alternative "command and control" regulation of who burns which fuels would be far more intrusive and far more costly.</p>
        <p>Like Senator Gore, they have kind words for "tradable permits" systems, where the Government auctions or gives away rights to pollute and then lets polluters buy permits from companies that can clean up most cheaply. Tradable permits have already saved $4 billion on programs to contain local air pollution, and they will likely save billions more as electric utilities strive to curb acid rain over the next decade.</p>
        <p>And while Senator Gore has apparently not addressed the issue, he would no doubt find much to like in the Stavins-Grumbly proposal to create a refundable deposit system for lead batteries. Today much of the lead goes into landfills or up the stacks of incinerators. A refundable deposit -- say $10 a car battery -- would create a painless incentive to dispose of the lead safely.</p>
        <p>Where, then, is the beef? While the principals aren't willing to talk about the division on the record (and few are articulate about it off the record), it is possible to piece together the sources of mutual suspicion.</p>
        <p>The Gore camp fears the economists are not committed to environmental preservation where the object of preservation is intangible -- species diversity, wilderness, the noneconomic impact of climate change. The economists are frustrated by the other side's casual approach to matching priorities to risks, or to comparing costs and benefits. The result, they say, would be scattergun policies that put too much emphasis on relatively low-risk problems like abandoned toxic waste sites and too little on high-risk ones like lead and radon gas.</p>
        <p>The only open expression of conflict thus far has been over the role of Mr. Summers, the chief economist at the World Bank and widely regarded as one of the brightest, most innovative policy economists alive. His possible appointment as chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers is bitterly opposed by the Gore camp because he has never been very good at hiding his disdain for the touchy-feely environmentalists at the World Bank.</p>
        <p>This opposition is ironic because Mr. Summers has long been a champion of carbon taxes, the centerpiece of Mr. Gore's global warming strategy. And without Mr. Summers or another heavyweight economist to fight the battle, carbon taxes may well be shot down by a Treasury Secretary like Lloyd Bentsen. But it also suggests the deeper costs of the division.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's friends and allies, who will no doubt occupy major policy posts in the Environmental Protection Agency and the Cabinet departments, need the economists to design policies that generate the least possible drag on growth. And the economists need a solid front with the Gore people to push through market-based regulations bound to offend the old environmental guard.</p>
        <p>Can they make peace? The alternative may be an environmental policy that is all heart and no brains. And with environmental costs already pushing $140 billion, that would be no small loss.</p>
