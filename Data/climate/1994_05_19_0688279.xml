        <p>OU could make a case that Van Voorhees Park is just a rundown little playground in Brooklyn, so polluted by traffic from the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway and Atlantic Avenue that the children would be better off if a parking garage were put there.</p>
        <p>"That's a park?" said Brooklyn Borough President Howard Golden last week. "I used to go down there every day, and I was overwhelmed with the amount of pollution on the B.Q.E. And I never saw more than a handful of children utilizing it at any time of day."</p>

        <p>OU could make a case that Van Voorhees Park is just a rundown little playground in Brooklyn, so polluted by traffic from the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway and Atlantic Avenue that the children would be better off if a parking garage were put there.</p>
        <p>"That's a park?" said Brooklyn Borough President Howard Golden last week. "I used to go down there every day, and I was overwhelmed with the amount of pollution on the B.Q.E. And I never saw more than a handful of children utilizing it at any time of day."</p>
        <p>Or you could look at it in a different light, when the sun sets over the East River in the late afternoon and a breeze blows the smell of water through a cooling forest of three dozen old oaks. And teen-aged girls from Yemen, their hair swathed in black cloth, laugh on the swings.</p>
        <p>"If I give their names, their fathers would get upset," said a woman acting as their chaperone. "They're very strict. They don't even want us to take pictures of them. But they love this park, they really do."</p>
        <p>Lester Bates, the program director of the Brooklyn Central Y.M.C.A., says hundreds of children use the park, in the Cobble Hill section, after school. "It's the only park in the area with such great equipment," he said. "The kids can do their own thing here, and it's really safe."</p>
        <p>Yet, Long Island College Hospital says the park is deserted, rundown and ugly. The hospital, which is across the street from the park on the Hicks Street side, wants to build an eight-story, 430-car garage there.</p>
        <p>"It's a very unattractive visual site," said Arnold Tannen, the hospital's executive vice president. "Unless you have X-ray vision, you cannot see the water."</p>
        <p>It's true. You can't see the water from the playground. You get a great view of the Port Authority buildings on the harbor. And sometimes you have to raise your voice to be heard over the trucks.</p>
        <p>But what you do get is a wonderful quality of light on Atlantic Avenue as it opens up to the harbor. It's one of the reasons Brooklyn feels lighter in spirit than Manhattan -- no canyons.</p>
        <p>And what about the patients who can look out the west windows of the hospital? They're high up enough to see the harbor -- and children laughing in the playground. Views like these can be healing.</p>
        <p>And then there are the trees: 32 mature oaks, pumping out oxygen over the trucks, doing their part for air pollution, as well as beauty, in a city where about 15,000 trees die every year, and most don't live to be even seven years old.</p>
        <p>A recent United States Forest Service study of the Chicago metropolitan area showed that trees, which filter out sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide and ozone from the air, as well as provide shade in summer and wind protection in winter, save millions of dollars for that city.</p>
        <p>"To say that we don't need trees and a buffer zone near a highway is unconscionable," said Ronald Shiffman, one of the four members of the City Planning Commission who voted against the garage last July. "That's why Robert Moses built those little parks along the expressway."</p>
        <p>It was the hospital, in fact, that gave the land to the city in 1941, to allow space for the expressway and enough park to buffer it. So it would be ironic if the hospital got it back to park the very cars that Mr. Moses drew to the city by building all those highways and bridges. And placing a garage in the park, where the traffic of Hicks Street, Atlantic Avenue and the B.Q.E. all come together, opponents say, will only increase congestion.</p>
        <p>The hospital says it has to build the garage for medical reasons.  "We have cancer patients, people in wheelchairs," said Tom Dugan, a hospital spokesman. "To presume that they can walk five blocks from a garage is unrealistic."</p>
        <p>Roy Sloane, who has lived on Pacific Street, just east of the hospital, for almost 20 years, said that "there are about 400 physicians at the hospital" and that "they want to pull in and park, visit their patients and run on to the next hospital."</p>
        <p>Mr. Sloane led the members of the Cobble Hill Association in their fight against the hospital's first plan for a garage, at Pacific and Henry streets, right behind the hospital. The plan surfaced in 1982, threatening to cover up part of their sky and draw a stream of cars past their brownstones.</p>
        <p>They hired a lawyer. They started negotiating -- with Mr. Golden as the mediator. And after two years, the two sides struck a deal: if the hospital agreed not to build on Henry Street, the association would support a garage on Van Voorhees Park -- which, if you live in Cobble Hill, is already blocked from view by the hospital.</p>
        <p>The hospital also said it would build two "parklets" -- now it proposes three -- on Henry Street to make up for the lost park. The agreement was signed 10 years ago -- but it is essentially the same plan that made its way through the city's review process last summer.</p>
        <p>On July 19, the Planning Commission voted 7 to 4 in favor of the deal brokered by Mr. Golden. Mr. Shiffman, who teaches urban planning at the Pratt Institute, voted against the garage. He called the proposal "a political compromise, not a plan that emerged from a participatory process." He said residents of Atlantic Avenue, Brooklyn Heights, the borough and the city were not involved.</p>
        <p>A park, Mr. Shiffman said, should be destroyed or changed only under "extraordinary circumstances, and then only if it is replaced acre for acre in a manner that is accessible, inviting and open to the public." But the three parklets are "small, shadow dominated and encircled by hospital structures," he continued, adding, "They are totally inadequate as a replacement for the existing park."</p>
        <p>And if you walk down Henry Street, where the parklets would be, you will see that there is no light coming from the water, no open sense of sky. No oak trees.</p>
        <p>If you live in Cobble Hill, like Mr. Sloane, you may think the parklets a vast improvement -- because there are cars parked there now. But if you are a child who lives in an apartment and is used to running across a big playground, playing kickball in a river breeze, you might miss something. And Van Voorhees Park is a meeting ground for a rich mix of Hispanic, black and Middle Eastern children.</p>
        <p>Benjamin Baxt, an architect who has lived in Cobble Hill for 24 years, has proposed an alternative garage, for the corner of Amity and Hicks streets, right across from the emergency room. But the hospital said that the site was too small.</p>
        <p>The Parks Council, a coalition formed to protect public space in the city, has suggested using the underutilized city and private garages already in the area, with a shuttle system to and from the hospital.</p>
        <p>Many have pointed out the importance of Atlantic Avenue to the future development of the Brooklyn waterfront. A park is a more inviting gateway than a garage. But a hospital is not in the business of visionary planning. And there is no city plan for green space. So the city approved the plan brokered by Mr. Golden.</p>
        <p>Now, the garage is being held up by a lawsuit filed in State Supreme Court in Manhattan by the Friends of Van Voorhees Park, against the City of New York and the State Department of Health. It charges, mainly, that no alternatives were ever seriously considered. The suit has been put on hold until June 11 at the request of the Giuliani administration so it can consider the case.</p>
        <p>There is a greater issue here. Green space is disappearing, bit by bit, all over New York City, not just in Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>A police firing range occupies 50 acres of parkland in Pelham Bay Park in the Bronx. A new, larger tennis stadium is slated for Flushing Meadow-Corona Park in Queens. A state psychiatric research center is being built on Riverside Drive at 165th Street in Manhattan, on land that was intended as parkland but never purchased by the city.</p>
        <p>And this isn't just a New York City issue. It's happening all over the world. Last month, Sumiko Enbutsu of Tokyo helped the Friends of Van Voorhees Park plant a Japanese pagoda tree on the playground. She told the children helping her about how the Friends of Shinobazu Pond were trying to save a sacred lotus pond -- a former religious site that dates back to the 17th century and is a sanctuary for thousands of birds -- from a 600-car underground garage. She told of some progress: the original plan called for 2,000 cars and an exhaust tower, complete with revolving restaurant, poking up out of the pond.</p>
        <p>Van Voorhees Park doesn't have a sacred anything (unless you count trees and children). It's always been expendable.</p>
        <p>When Robert Moses first drew up his plans for the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, it went straight down Hicks Street, through Brooklyn Heights.</p>
        <p>"But the Brooklyn Heights neighborhood brokered a compromise, and the B.Q.E. swung westward, through Van Voorhees Park," said Steve Whitehouse, the director of planning for the Parks Department. So Van Voorhees Park got the B.Q.E. -- and Brooklyn Heights got the Promenade.</p>
        <p>What Van Voorhees Park needs from Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is the wisdom of a Solomon.  GARDEN NOTEBOOK</p>
