        <p>Getting struck by lightning may seem like a sign of singular disfavor, as if a wrathful Zeus had marked a mortal for mayhem. But to lightning researchers, strikes are an everyday phenomenon and may become, if not common, at least less rare.</p>
        <p>Lightning -- the atmospheric discharge of electricity -- occurs about 100 times a second worldwide. But there is evidence, said Dr. Martin A. Uman, of the University of Florida's Lightning Research Center, that warmer, wetter summers are leading to more lightning. And if the theory of global warming is correct, he said, ''we could see double or triple, even more, in the number of lightning strikes by mid-century.''</p>
        <p>Even now, the National Severe Storms Laboratory calculates, the odds of getting hit in a given year are shorter than winning the lottery: some 1 in 700,000. On average, lightning kills 70 Americans and injures 300 annually. Four people were hit and hurt in in New Jersey in less than 48 hours recently; a few days earlier, in Florida, an engineering professor was hit and died.</p>
        <p>Over the last 100 years, fewer people have been struck, largely because of the shift from outdoor life on farms to indoor life in cities. Greater awareness helps, too.</p>
        <p>Dr. Mary Ann Cooper, a specialist in emergency medicine at the University of Illinois, says know to stay or get indoors -- or crouch. ''You're a target outdoors,'' she said. ''You need to make yourself short and small.''</p>
