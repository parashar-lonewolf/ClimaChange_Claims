        <p>President-elect Bill Clinton aims to convey an impression of boldness and change during his first days in the Oval Office by issuing a whirlwind of executive orders on abortion rights, White House perquisites and government ethics, his aides predict.</p>
        <p>They sketch an ambitious domestic agenda for his first weeks, during which Mr. Clinton has said he will "focus like a laser beam on this economy" and "foreign policy will come into play in part as it affects the economy."</p>
        <p>Aides predict that the new President will quickly move on matters he can change with the stroke of a pen, like doing away with fancy dining room privileges for high officials and reversing Bush Administration bans on fetal-tissue research and abortion counseling at federally financed clinics. Coming Back to Character</p>
        <p>But some of Mr. Clinton's campaign aides and friends, often sounding eerily like President Bush on the campaign trail, say the success of these plans rests a great deal on unanswered questions about Mr. Clinton's character:</p>
        <p>*Can a man who is so eager to please say no to the demands of the power-starved interest groups that contributed to his election?</p>
        <p>*Can a policy specialist with so many detailed proposals choose a few crucial initiatives and single-mindedly push them through, rather than try to do everything at once?</p>
        <p>*Can a man so sharply identified with his generation select a cross section of advisers that balances Washington experience with a youthful urge for change and power? List of Initiatives</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton's agenda is still embryonic, and it is hard to tell which of the aides now describing it will be around after inauguration day on Jan. 20. And, inevitably, aides sometimes confuse their boss's priorities with their own.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, interviews with Clinton advisers, friends and campaign aides in the last weeks of the Presidential campaign suggest that his first 100 days will begin with several executive orders reversing Republican social policies. They say the list could include all or some of these:</p>
        <p>*Ending the ban on homosexuals in the military and the ban on abortion in military hospitals overseas.</p>
        <p>*Repealing bans on abortion counseling at federally financed clinics and research using fetal tissue.</p>
        <p>*Allowing the importing from France of RU-486, the morning-after abortion pill.</p>
        <p>*Establishing a family-leave policy for Federal employees who want time off to care for children or sick relatives.</p>
        <p>*Revoking the Reagan-Bush policy of forbidding American aid to foreign organizations that provide abortion services, counseling or referrals.</p>
        <p>*Trimming the White House staff and eliminating executive dining rooms and other subsidized perks for top officials.</p>
        <p>*Requiring political appointees to sign a pledge barring lobbying of their Government agencies for five years after they leave office. The current legal limit is one year. Legislation  Looking to Set Right Agenda</p>
        <p>The Clinton team says it wants Congress to pass within the first 100 days a combination of tax incentives and public-works spending measures to stimulate the economy, perhaps delaying at first Mr. Clinton's campaign pledge to cut the deficit.</p>
        <p>As for his other major legislative aims, including health-care and welfare reform and job training, Clinton aides have given themselves a 100-day deadline to submit legislation in these areas. But they do not expect passage that early.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton's aides say he talks about keeping his legislative agenda broad enough to take full advantage of his mandate for economic change but lean enough to avoid choking the House Ways and Means Committee, through which all tax legislation passes, with so many bills that nothing is passed.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, a friend recalls asking Mr. Clinton in June which transition model he would follow: Ronald Reagan, who in his first 100 days focused on one issue and got tax and budget changes through Congress, or Jimmy Carter, who pressed 15 equal proposals so complex and controversial that virtually none were approved.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton replied that he would follow the Reagan model, but then ticked off a list of initiatives he would propose.</p>
        <p>"Sounds to me more like Jimmy Carter," his friend told him. Personnel  Fierce Competition For Choice Jobs</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton's first task will be to choose the leading members of his domestic-economic team: chief of staff, director of the Office of Management and Budget, chief of his Council of Economic Advisers, Secretary of the Treasury and White House liaison with Congress, which will be a crucial job in his Administration.</p>
        <p>Already, rivalries are building. In the last two weeks of the Presidential campaign, staff members at the Clinton-Gore campaign headquarters in Arkansas were playing a game that could best be called "Did you see who just walked by with his resume?" The words were usually said in disgust, because as Mr. Clinton's victory became more certain the young staff members became more resentful of the job seekers who haunted Little Rock like apparitions from the Democratic past.</p>
        <p>For the first time since the cold war began, the fight for 16 Cabinet posts and 8,500 other political appointments is being fought more along generational lines than ideological ones. Officials who served in the middle ranks of the Carter, Johnson and even Kennedy Administrations -- bursting with ambition after 12 years in the wilderness -- are already clamoring for high-level jobs.</p>
        <p>But there is a new generation of Democrats, men and women in their 30's and 40's, who think it is their turn and resent having to compete with the party elders.</p>
        <p>And there are "Friends of Bill," an informal group of people dubbed F.O.B.'s who have known Mr. Clinton for years and share many of his goals and instincts. It includes Robert Reich, an economics professor at Harvard University; Roger Altman, a New York investment banker and former Treasury official; Ira Magaziner, a Providence, R.I., consultant on domestic policy; Eli J. Segal, a Boston businessman and the campaign chief of staff, and Susan Thomases, a New York lawyer and a leading campaign adviser.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton's problem is, as one adviser put it, that while he is clearly committed to bringing in new blood, "you also don't want people who don't know where the bathroom is, because there is so much to be done so quickly." Structure</p>
        <p>Revamping Office For a New Politics</p>
        <p>Whomever Mr. Clinton chooses, the appointments will almost certainly have to be accompanied by bureaucratic restructuring to reflect the new President's appreciation for the link between politics and governing.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush tended to view politics as something reserved for election seasons, not as an instrument for governing, a task he preferred to pursue behind closed doors with fellow power-brokers.</p>
        <p>By contrast, Mr. Clinton and his aides say he will conduct a permanent campaign for his agenda, with regular bus tours and town meetings to build and maintain a public constituency for his legislation. The Clinton team has clearly learned during the Presidential campaign that this direct contact with voters is also a way to get around the filter of the media.</p>
        <p>This objective has led to a kind of detailed organizational planning that many Presidents might scorn as bureaucratic tinkering but that members of the Clinton team consider crucial. They think it is important, for example, to combine the White House communications office with the White House Congressional liaison office to reinforce the White House's lobbying of Congress with its broader messages to the public.</p>
        <p>As put by one Clinton adviser, who like most others refused to be identified for fear that it might complicate his or her efforts to be chosen to serve in Washington: "You are not going to pass controversial legislation like health care or welfare reform without the American people behind you. That means integrating communications and legislation. Bush's idea of legislative affairs was having the Speaker of the House up for a drink at the end of the day. That will not be Clinton's."</p>
        <p>Another bureaucratic change, Clinton aides say, will be to break down the wall between the National Security Council and the Council of Economic Advisers. Mr. Clinton has promised to create some sort of economic security council to integrate foreign policy and domestic economic policy, which he contends are inseparable.</p>
        <p>Pundits around Washington are already lining up to see who will be the first to write about the inevitable turf clash between a new economic security adviser and the Treasury Secretary.  Policies  Setting Priorities, Voicing Concerns</p>
        <p>As for the longer-term initiatives, the top priority will be an economic-stimulus package, which Mr. Clinton and his aides say they want to have in Congress's hands the day after his inauguration.</p>
        <p>"Even though he has detailed positions on a lot of issues, and an activist philosophy, some things will take precedence over others," said Bruce Reed, Mr. Clinton's issues adviser. "I think it is safe to say that the economic package will be priority 1A."</p>
        <p>The first question that advisers say they will have to decide is which elements of this economic plan go to Congress immediately and which, like health care and welfare reform, may have to come later.</p>
        <p>The elements almost certain to go up immediately, aides predict, will be a proposal for an investment tax credit for new plants and equipment, a capital gains tax reduction for investments in new businesses held for at least five years, permanent tax incentives for research and development, initiatives for job training and apprenticeships, and new spending at $20 billion a year for roads, bridges and other public works.</p>
        <p>In theory, these programs would be financed by spending cuts in areas like the military and the Federal bureaucracy and by tax increases on overseas corporate profits and Americans earning more than $200,000 a year.</p>
        <p>Since many economists have contended that the tax increases will not pay for the new spending, Mr. Clinton has repeatedly promised to reduce his spending plans to the level of revenue available to finance them rather than raise taxes on the middle class.</p>
        <p>But while the President-elect and his aides insist they will not go to the still-loosely defined middle class to finance economic stimulation, they have not ruled out increasing the Federal deficit in the short term.</p>
        <p>"The question," one economic adviser said, "is, 'If the economy is still dead in the water in January, will we need some sort of net stimulus, something that is not just revenue neutral?' It could be some additional infrastructure spending, it could be a higher investment tax credit or it could be more generous credits for companies which create new jobs over a historical baseline."</p>
        <p>Such a package, the adviser said, "would have to be wrapped in a legislative deal that would insure that once the economy is back on track the budget would get cut by an equal amount."</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton's fear of bloating the deficit, his aides say, is at least equaled by his concern that his own, often unrestrained, campaign promises have created expectations for a miraculous economic fix. Whereas six months ago, the candidate's whole emphasis was "I have a plan," now that he has been elected, the mantra of the day is "No quick fixes."</p>
        <p>"The big issue out there is what should be in the first legislative package," a leading Clinton economic adviser said. "The sub-issue is how do you handle expectations. The problems are deep and longstanding, and therefore easy, quick, visible successes will be hard to come by." Troubling Thoughts</p>
        <p>Another worry that aides seem to share is that since much of the new spending in any economic-growth package would go into public works the possibilities for a pork-barrel feast are enormous.</p>
        <p>"We have to think very carefully about where money will go without looking porkish," one adviser said. "That means making sure that the projects are high priority in anybody's book. Otherwise people are just going to say, 'There go the Democrats. They came back and started throwing money everywhere.' "</p>
        <p>Equally tricky will be integrating environmental concerns into the plan for economic recovery, as Mr. Clinton has promised to do. Saying there is "good infrastructure and bad infrastructure," environmentalists want to insure, for example, that public-works spending leans away from autos, trucks and highways and toward rail, mass transit and pedestrian systems. Early drafts of Mr. Clinton's proposals have disappointed many of them.</p>
        <p>"The problem," one environmental adviser said, "is that the only plans on the shelf, ready to go, shovel the money out the door and create a lot of jobs, are for more highways. So you lock in lots of long-term spending on things you don't want and you undermine his other environmental goals. If he goes that way, he will be fought by environmentalists."</p>
        <p>Whatever happens, once the economic-jobs program is on its way, Clinton aides say they expect other proposals to be broached with Congress in some form in the first 100 days. These include changes in health care, college tuition in return for government service, requiring welfare recipients to work and proposals to improve the energy efficiency of the economy by 20 percent by 2000 and to stabilize carbon dioxide emissions by 2000 at 1990 levels.</p>
        <p>But officials say they do not expect such proposals as well as those on family leave and campaign financing to be passed that quickly.</p>
        <p>Money is part of the problem, but even more important is the lack of consensus on how to approach controversial issues like health care and welfare reform. Indeed, Clinton aides seem less vexed by finances than by the specter of hostile forces in their own camp. A Democratic Congress, they warn, is no guarantee of consensus.</p>
        <p>More than 100 new members of Congress are eager to make their mark, not to mention the other 435 who already have their own agendas. The influence of lobbyists is also as great as ever. Even where there is general agreement among Democrats, there is plenty of room for dissension; for example, there are already at least six health-care plans in the Senate.</p>
        <p>"The difficulty will be in persuading Congress to pass his agenda, not theirs," said Mr. Reed, the issues adviser.</p>
        <p>Finessing lawmakers will require Mr. Clinton's best imitation of Lyndon B. Johnson's talent for soothing egos and stroking constituencies.</p>
        <p>"Labor, minorities, environmentalists, blacks, Hispanics, women, retired people, you name it, all see the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow," a top Clinton aide said. "And somebody is going to be very disappointed."  THE TRANSITION: PLANS AND POLICIES</p>
