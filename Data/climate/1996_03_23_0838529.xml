        <p>The price of permits for coal-fired utility plants to pollute the air is expected to dip to its lowest level yet when the Chicago Board of Trade announces on Tuesday the results of the annual auction it runs for the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
        <p>The price decline is likely to lead to new questions about how badly Congress overestimated the financial burdens of cleaning the air and whether utilities should now be required to make deeper cuts in their emissions of sulfur dioxide. That pollution is thought to be the major source of acid rain that kills trees and fish in the Northeast.</p>
        <p>The cost of preventing pollution has fallen by half in just two years," said Daniel Jaffe, executive director of the National Healthy Air License Exchange, a Cleveland-based environmental group that buys permits in the auction to keep them out of the hands of utilities. Each permit allows the release of one ton of sulfur dioxide.</p>
        <p>Although the Board of Trade will not finish tabulating the bids until Monday, Mr. Jaffe's group has been told that bids of $70 a permit that it submitted would be filled. His group's bids used more than $20,000 raised by schoolchildren in Glens Falls, N.Y. Traders say the average successful bid for the permits, technically known as allowances, could be as low as $66 this year,  half the $132 of a year ago.</p>
        <p>This year's auction, the fourth, will be the biggest so far, with 150,000 permits available for immediate use, triple last year's number. The E.P.A. will also sell 25,000 allowances usable in 2002 and 100,000 for 2003.</p>
        <p>The Board of Trade said today that the number of bids, many of them for thousands of permits, was up 60 percent from the 150 bids received last year. Traders say the sharp increase may signal a new maturity in the market.</p>
        <p>The Board of Trade expects to fill many bids below the current spot market price of $70 to $75. But if the lowest price that clears all the remaining permits off the table is only a few dollars less than the spot price, enough bidders could be caught short to create buying pressure in the spot market.</p>
        <p>"It could bounce back to $100 fairly quickly," said Carlton Bartels, director of Cantor Fitzgerald Environmental Brokerage Services in New York, citing the price that prevailed in over-the-counter trading as recently as December.</p>
        <p>The auction and the over-the-counter trading are outgrowths of the Clean Air  Act of 1990, which mandated reductions in the overall levels of sulfur dioxide emitted by utilities, starting in 1995. It set up a market system to give the industry a way of reaching the goals as inexpensively as possible.</p>
        <p>The market in pollution permits encourages utilities to switch to cleaner coal and to install air pollution control equipment or make operating changes to reduce pollution.</p>
        <p>The utilities can sell allowances they do not need to other utilities that might find it cheaper to buy the permits rather than take action to cut pollution. Such utilities might, for example, be far from sources of low-sulfur  coal or have older plants not well suited to renovation.</p>
        <p>When the Clean Air Act passed in 1990, the allowances were expected to trade  for $300 to $750 each. Utility executives said then that meeting the air-quality requirements would cost their industry as much as $5 billion. Restrictions under the act were imposed on the worst polluters starting last year, but industrywide limits will not take effect until the year 2000.</p>
        <p>What Congress did not anticipate in 1990 was that railroad deregulation would drastically cut the cost of shipping low-sulfur coal from the huge Powder River  Basin deposits in Wyoming. The price of scrubbers, which grab pollutants out of  smokestacks, has also fallen by 50 percent. And utilities have learned to be more efficient about blending different coals to cut pollution.</p>
        <p>As the cost of reducing pollution fell, utilities accelerated their compliance programs, taking millions of tons of pollution out of the air sooner  than expected. Indeed, the utilities put twice the required number of power plants into the program at the start in 1995, so that the utilities could get more of the pollution allowances issued directly by the E.P.A.</p>
        <p>Some utilities have stockpiled enough allowances to defer spending hundreds of millions of dollars they would otherwise have had to spend to upgrade power plants before the tougher emissions limits take effect four years from now.</p>
        <p>With pollution control costing less, the average price of an allowance at the Board of Trade auction has fallen from $159 in 1994 to the $132 of last year and to this year's projected result below $70. Between auctions, the over-the-counter price has steadily drifted downward as well.</p>
        <p>"So far, procrastination has saved buyers money," Mr. Carlton said.</p>
        <p>The auction has become a headache for market makers like Mr. Carlton's firm.  In the months preceding the auction, speculators sell short -- that is, sell borrowed allowances -- confident that in the flood of allowances released by the auction they will be able to buy back at prices below those in the spot market.</p>
        <p>"The auction just inserts volatility," Mr. Carlton said. "It's a classic example of the Government harming a marketplace by trying to help it along."</p>
        <p>But environmental organizations like Mr. Jaffe's group disagree. They see the opportunity to buy allowances as an important education tool and a practical if  small way to reduce pollution. "The auction is a real democratizing feature," said Mr. Jaffe, whose group hopes to retire as many as 600 allowances this year.</p>
