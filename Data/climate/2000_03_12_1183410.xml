        <p>A large new federal study shows that doctors can save certain patients' lives in the intensive care unit if they set their respirators so that less air is delivered than many doctors had thought necessary.</p>

        <p>A large new federal study shows that doctors can save certain patients' lives in the intensive care unit if they set their respirators so that less air is delivered than many doctors had thought necessary.</p>
        <p>The study involved patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, a condition in which the lungs are partly filled with fluid, making it impossible for patients to breathe without respirators. The condition can occur with pneumonia but it also occurs in trauma patients, including people who were in automobile accidents or who had major surgery.</p>
        <p>An estimated 100,000 Americans of all ages develop the disorder each year, medical experts said. If they recover, most have no lingering symptoms. But nearly half die.</p>
        <p>To determine how best to keep these patients alive with respirators while their lungs recover, the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute sponsored a study that enrolled 861 patients across the country. They were randomly assigned to one of two treatment strategies.</p>
        <p>The results showed that death rates from the disease could be cut by nearly 25 percent, a result so decisive that the study ended last March, nine months ahead of schedule.</p>
        <p>One of the principal investigators, Dr. Roy G. Brower of Johns Hopkins University, announced the findings at a medical meeting in April and began preparing a paper for publication. That paper was accepted about two weeks ago by The New England Journal of Medicine, and an edited version was completed this week, Dr. Brower said.</p>
        <p>The journal deemed the results so important that it released the paper yesterday, posting it on its Web site (www.nejm.org). The paper will appear in the issue dated May 4.</p>
        <p>One treatment strategy was to push large volumes of air into patients' lungs, at high pressure. The advantage was that sufficient oxygen got into patients' blood. But the concern was that the pressures would damage the lung tissue, slowing healing or making it impossible.</p>
        <p>The second strategy was for the respirators to provide less oxygen, even though many patients would become ''air hungry'' -- wanting more breath. In addition, Dr. Brower said, with less oxygen going into the lungs, carbon dioxide can build up in the blood, causing its own problems and making patients feel worse.</p>
        <p>''If carbon dioxide accumulates, it contributes to the distress the patient feels,'' Dr. Brower said. ''It can make the heart beat faster, sometimes fast enough to make it a concern.'' Frantic for breath, with pounding hearts, some patients have to be sedated, he added.</p>
        <p>Still, the study showed that while nearly 40 percent of the patients who received large volumes of air died, just 31 percent of those receiving less air died.</p>
        <p>''This is massively important,'' said Dr. Thomas Stewart, the director of the intensive care unit at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto, who did not participate in the Federal study. Family members, he said, should be aware ''that the way their physicians are managing the patients makes a difference to their outcomes.'' They need to be sure that the doctors are setting the respirators to provide less air and gentler pressure in the lungs, he said.</p>
        <p>''I've never, ever, had any family member come and talk to me about that,'' Dr. Stewart said. But, he added, ''now they will.''</p>
