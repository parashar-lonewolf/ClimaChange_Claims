        <p>LEAD: THANKS to a companion ship that lassoed giant icebergs and towed them out of the way, a research vessel has drilled through the sea floor off Antarctica and extracted detailed samples recording the continent's complex, even verdant, past.</p>
        <p>THANKS to a companion ship that lassoed giant icebergs and towed them out of the way, a research vessel has drilled through the sea floor off Antarctica and extracted detailed samples recording the continent's complex, even verdant, past.</p>
        <p>The samples are the most recent results of the Ocean Drilling Project, an internationally supported effort to extract clues to the earth's history from the ocean floor. Since the project was revived under new direction in 1985, scientists have drilled at many sites in the Atlantic as well as some in the Mediterranean and west of South America, often producing unexpected findings about the earth's geological and climatic history.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most interesting and unexpected recent discoveries came from the drilling near Antarctica. The new evidence shows astounding differences in the climate histories of East and West Antarctica. It confirms theories that the continent once enjoyed temperate weather. And it contradicts the belief that West Antarctica occasionally sheds its ice and rapidly raises global sea levels. Sediments under the nearby Weddell Sea show no evidence of any such ice loss over the past 4.8 million years, the scientists found.</p>
        <p>This finding is good news for people who fear that such a sudden discharge of ice will follow warming of the climate, according to Dr. James P. Kennett of the University of Rhode Island, who led the project with Dr. Peter Barker of the University of Birmingham in Britain. Such warming, the ''greenhouse effect,'' is predicted from increased carbon dioxide and other industrial gases in the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>The new evidence indicates that even though the climate was sometimes almost subtropical, the West Antarctic ice has remained intact for nearly 5 million years. There is strong evidence that global sea levels rose as much as 30 feet in such times, but Dr. Kennett said it now appeared that this was due to gradual melting of ice near both poles, rather than a sudden melting from West Antarctica. West Antarctica is an ice-covered archipelago about the size of the Philippines. It is separated from East Antarctica by one of the Earth's great mountain systems, which spans the continent.</p>
        <p>The scientists operated from the drill ship Joides Resolution in the Weddell Sea for two months ending in March. Cores containing cross sections of sea floor sediment accumulated over 50 million years or more were extracted by drilling into the bottom, sometimes beneath three miles of water.</p>
        <p>A variety of surprising clues to Antarctica's history emerged. Spores and pollen grains showed that, until about 39 million years ago, the continent was lush with beech trees and with ferns that, like those of New England, require frost-free periods.</p>
        <p>Microscopic fossils of freshwater diatoms, algae with silica shells, were found off Kapp Norvegia in Queen Maud Land and off the Antarctic Peninsula reaching toward South America. The diatoms were apparently washed from lakes on the peninsula as recently as 20 million years ago.</p>
        <p>Dr. Kennett said the scientists found in the sample cores that clays typical of those produced by ordinary weathering gave way with surprising abruptness to the type produced by the grinding action of ice.</p>
        <p>The main West Antarctic ice sheet began forming about 8 million years ago. There apparently were periods when the ice melted, feeding rivers that deposited sand and gravel on the continental shelf.</p>
        <p>Periodically these accumulations cascaded down the sea floor slope, depositing layers of sand and gravel that were penetrated by the scientists' drill. Above the depth formed 4.8 million years ago these deposits vanished. This is believed to be when the ice cover of West Antarctica became permanent. The remaining upper layers are strikingly uniform.</p>
        <p>Dr. Kennett said previous drilling into the floor of the Bellingshausen Sea, on the other side of the Antarctic Peninsula, produced a similar record of prolonged ice sheet stability. In East, a Different Story</p>
        <p>Cores obtained off Queen Maud Land in East Antarctica tell a different story, he said. They show that an ice cover began to form there far earlier, some 37 million years ago.</p>
        <p>But until about 15 million years ago the ice sheet was incomplete. The discovery of abundant diatoms that could live only in sunny coastal waters indicated that before that time the ice sheet did not extend over the ocean in the form of ice shelves, as it does today.</p>
        <p>Today an upwelling of bottom waters rich in nutrients makes the oceans near Antarctica among the most biologically productive in the world; whales and sea birds migrate there to fatten. This upwelling apparently began about 8 million years ago, when the sediment shows a gradual increase of silica derived from the shells of marine organisms.</p>
        <p>Because of the iceberg-towing feats of the research ship's companion, the Maersk Master, the Joides Resolution survived the treacherous Weddell Sea, which has crushed or trapped such ships as Ernest Shackleton's Endurance and Otto Nordenskjold's Antarctic. When radar showed an advancing iceberg the Maersk Master went to work, said David Huey, the expedition's engineering specialist.</p>
        <p>The ship would sail around the iceberg and pay out a tow line. Once the berg had been completely encircled, the lassoed berg would be towed away. Dr. Kennett said one of the icebergs weighed ''tens of millions of tons.'' The towing speed was about half a knot, but varied because deep currents, acting on the 800-foot draft of the berg, pushed it in random directions. At times, according to Mr. Huey, radar tracking showed ''that the berg was towing the ship.''</p>
        <p>The drilling project, which is based at Texas A &amp; M University, has also made surprising recent discoveries indicating that extraordinary outpourings of lava occurred as Europe and North America were drawing apart some 50 million years ago.</p>
        <p>The Joides Resolution drilled eight holes into the sea floor between Norway and Jan Mayen Island. One of them, on the Voring Plateau, penetrated 4,032 feet into the sea floor beneath 4,200 feet of water. Except for the top 1,033 feet of sediment, the entire structure was volcanic.</p>
        <p>Study of the recovered cores revealed 121 separate lava flows separated by 49 layers of volcanic debris and seven sills formed by subterranean intrusions of lava, like the one that produced the Hudson River Palisades. Fossils in the debris show the eruptions occurred 36 million to 58 million years ago, most of the more recent ones above water.</p>
        <p>The site was chosen in an effort to settle a longstanding debate on the nature of layers that are strong reflectors of seismic waves and lie beneath the deep sediments flanking both sides of the Atlantic. Some scientists had suggested that the layers might be a nonvolcanic layer of rock serving as a lid on underlying petroleum deposits.</p>
        <p>When the Atlantic began opening 100 million years ago, great rift valleys were formed, followed by volcanic outpourings, such as those forming the Palisades, the Watchung Mountains of New Jersey, and the volcanic ridges of Connecticut. Those outpourings, however, ended long before the newly discovered eruptions.</p>
        <p>The gradual opening of ocean passages was also a key factor in the cooling that produced the ice covers of East and West Antarctica, said Dr. Kennett. One, the Drake Passage, lies between South America and the Antarctic Peninsula. First One Passage, Then Another</p>
        <p>He believes this occurred some 23 million years ago, although he said others placed the time as recently as 15 million years ago. The other critical passage is between Australia and Antarctica. In the 1970's sampling of its floor by the drill ship Glomar Challenger, when the drilling project was administered by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, indicated that the two continents began separating 55 million years ago.</p>
        <p>With both passages open it became possible for ocean currents and winds to circle the continent unimpeded, forming the weather pattern that now dominates the southern region.</p>
        <p>The Joides Resolution went to sea in January 1985. Ten American oceanographic institutions contribute to the Ocean Drilling Project, along with the National Science Foundation and Canada, the European Science Foundation's Ocean Drilling Consortium, Japan, France and West Germany. The Soviet Union has been invited to join but the Defense Department has asked that the invitation be reconsidered.</p>
