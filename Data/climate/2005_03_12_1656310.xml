      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial holds that Senate committee pretty much killed Pres Bush's Clear Skies initiative, flawed rewrite of country's basic clean air laws; contends that it would have done more for industries that pollute air than for people who breathe it; notes that committee's action was followed by new rule from Environmental Protection Agency aimed at significantly reducing smog, soot and acid rain caused by power plant emissions in East and Midwest</p>

        <p>Americans in the eastern half of the country will be able to breathe a little easier in years to come as a result of two developments in Washington this week. First, a Senate committee pretty much killed President Bush's Clear Skies initiative, a deeply flawed rewrite of the country's basic clean air laws. It would have done more for the industries that pollute the air (and helped write the bill) than for the people who breathe it. The committee's action was swiftly followed by a new rule from the Environmental Protection Agency aimed at significantly reducing the smog, soot and acid rain caused by power plant emissions in the East and Midwest.</p>
        <p>The agency had held the new rule in reserve in case Congress could not agree on Clear Skies. Known as the Clean Air Interstate Rule, it is intended to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides, which help create smog, by 60 percent over 10 years, and of sulfur dioxide, which creates soot, by more than 70 percent. Both contribute to acid rain, a scourge of Northeastern forests like the Adirondacks.</p>

        <p>Americans in the eastern half of the country will be able to breathe a little easier in years to come as a result of two developments in Washington this week. First, a Senate committee pretty much killed President Bush's Clear Skies initiative, a deeply flawed rewrite of the country's basic clean air laws. It would have done more for the industries that pollute the air (and helped write the bill) than for the people who breathe it. The committee's action was swiftly followed by a new rule from the Environmental Protection Agency aimed at significantly reducing the smog, soot and acid rain caused by power plant emissions in the East and Midwest.</p>
        <p>The agency had held the new rule in reserve in case Congress could not agree on Clear Skies. Known as the Clean Air Interstate Rule, it is intended to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides, which help create smog, by 60 percent over 10 years, and of sulfur dioxide, which creates soot, by more than 70 percent. Both contribute to acid rain, a scourge of Northeastern forests like the Adirondacks.</p>
        <p>Clear Skies had essentially the same targets and timetables. But Clear Skies would also have gutted several vital Clean Air Act provisions that Eastern states in particular have found useful in combating windblown pollution from other states. One of these provisions requires power plants to install state-of-the-art pollution controls whenever they significantly upgrade plants. Another allows states to sue each other over windblown pollution.</p>
        <p>The new rule, in other words, has all of the upside of Clear Skies with none of the downside. It could have been stronger. But there is no reason that it cannot be strengthened in the future, and state officials -- who are ultimately responsible under the Clean Air Act for providing their residents with healthy air -- still have access to the various regulatory mechanisms that Mr. Bush's Clear Skies proposals would have taken away.</p>
        <p>The next piece of news on the clean air front is likely to be much less cheery for the environmental community than this week's news. The E.P.A. is scheduled to unveil on Wednesday its long-awaited rule on mercury, a highly toxic pollutant that has been found in fish.</p>
        <p>Because previous administrations largely ducked the mercury issue, this will be the first effort to regulate mercury emissions from power plants, which are responsible for about 48 of the 113 tons produced in the United States every year. Environmentalists are sure to argue, however, that the rule fails to control local depositions of mercury, does not exploit proven technologies that could lead to even greater reductions and, in general, is biased toward industry.</p>
        <p>This much is certain: the clean air wars, which have been a reliable feature of the political landscape in Washington ever since the original Clean Air Act was passed more than 34 years ago, will continue, in the courts if not in Congress.</p>
