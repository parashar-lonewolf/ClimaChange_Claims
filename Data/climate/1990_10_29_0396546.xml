        <p>This is the last of five articles on Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's record.</p>
        <p>The first article, on Oct. 2, detailed Mr. Cuomo's efforts to improve the criminal-justice system by building more jail cells, and the problems the system continues to have.</p>
        <p>The second article, on Oct. 5, described what the Governor has done on environmental issues, including auto emissions, water-quality standards and acid rain, and how despite those efforts, the problems remain.</p>
        <p>The third article, on Oct. 9, said that while Mr. Cuomo had declared the Decade of the Child and invested $1.4 billion in child- related programs, that the condition of much of New York's youth is dismal.</p>
        <p>The fourth article, on Oct. 20, said that homelessness has soared, despite several housing programs by Mr. Cuomo.</p>
