        <p>THE rates at which two ozone-destroying gases, halon 1301 and halon 1211, are accumulating in the atmosphere have fallen by about half since 1987, when the United States and 22 other nations agreed to stop producing them by the year 2000, a study shows.</p>
        <p>The decline in emissions supports industries' claims to be on or ahead of schedule in cutting halon production to the levels mandated by an agreement called the Montreal Protocol and reflects the search for cheaper, safer alternatives, said Dr. James W. Elkins of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association, who participated in the study.</p>

        <p>THE rates at which two ozone-destroying gases, halon 1301 and halon 1211, are accumulating in the atmosphere have fallen by about half since 1987, when the United States and 22 other nations agreed to stop producing them by the year 2000, a study shows.</p>
        <p>The decline in emissions supports industries' claims to be on or ahead of schedule in cutting halon production to the levels mandated by an agreement called the Montreal Protocol and reflects the search for cheaper, safer alternatives, said Dr. James W. Elkins of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association, who participated in the study.</p>
        <p>"This is really good news for the environment," he said. "What it means is that voluntary and mandated reductions in halons are working."</p>
        <p>Halons, manmade bromine compounds used in fire extinguishers, are far less concentrated in the atmosphere than chlorofluorocarbons, which are used in air-conditioners and aerosol sprays. But halons destroy ozone 10 to 40 times faster because the bromine monoxide formed when the bromine splits an ozone molecule goes on to catalyze new reactions.</p>
        <p>Dr. James H. Butler of the Federal agency, who headed the study, measured halon concentrations in air samples from points on land and sea from Alaska to Tasmania in 1987 and monthly since 1989. Dr. Butler and colleagues at the agency and at the University of Colorado published their results in the current issue of Nature.</p>
        <p>The rate of increase of the amount of halon 1301 in the lower atmosphere slowed to 8 percent a year from 1989 to 1992 -- about half the average annual rate of increase over the previous 12 years. In the same period, the growth rate of halon 1211 fell to 3 percent from an annual growth rate that was as high as 15 percent.</p>
        <p>The Montreal Protocol requires halon production to hit 50 percent of 1986 levels by 1995. A 50 percent drop in emissions does not necessarily imply an equal drop in production, since new gas may be stockpiled or old gas released. But scientists said the study indicated that countries were complying with the treaty.</p>
        <p>"It is encouraging to see the first atmospheric signs of public policy choices," said Dr. Daniel Albritton of N.O.A.A. "Of course, it doesn't mean we're out of the woods yet."</p>
        <p>Dr. Jessica Tuchman Mathews of the World Resources Institute said the Montreal Protocol had been "politically and environmentally an extraordinary success story." President Bush called on industry last February to speed the clean-up, stopping all halon production by 1995.</p>
