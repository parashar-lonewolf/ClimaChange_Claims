        <p>Your May 9 front-page article on early farmers and the sowing of languages discusses theories behind the transmission of languages in Europe. You report on new scholarly support, using genetic evidence, for the theory that language spread into Europe along with agriculture between 10,000 and 4,000 years ago. This theory is supposed to contradict the prevailing theory that language is spread by military conquest.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your May 9 front-page article on early farmers and the sowing of languages discusses theories behind the transmission of languages in Europe. You report on new scholarly support, using genetic evidence, for the theory that language spread into Europe along with agriculture between 10,000 and 4,000 years ago. This theory is supposed to contradict the prevailing theory that language is spread by military conquest.</p>
        <p>I would like to suggest that the proponents of this theory pay attention to the</p>
        <p>rate</p>
        <p>of the genetic change they are tracking across Europe. Your map tracks the spread of agriculture into Europe along zones divided by millennia. Changes occurring over thousands of years are very slow changes. Language conquests usually occur much more rapidly (over decades and centuries).</p>
        <p>Modern examples are the spread of Spanish to South America, and English to the Philippines, French to Canada and English to the United States. All took place in less than a century, and all were spread by conquest. The transfer of technology such as agriculture and the growth of empires also occur at rates involving decades or centuries.</p>
        <p>I believe other mechanisms are needed to explain changes occurring across millennia, and to explain why it took six millennia for agriculture to reach Northern Europe.</p>
        <p>The obvious candidate here is climate. Recall that the mini ice age ended about 8,000 to 9,000 years ago. At that time the Middle East was cooler, wetter and consequently more fertile. Sweden was covered with ice. So, 8,000 years ago agriculture in Northern Europe was impossible and consequently could not spread there.</p>
        <p>A modern example of this is Alaska, where humans continue to be hunter-gatherers because the climate is unsuitable for agriculture. If there is a substantial greenhouse effect, this will change.</p>
        <p>As the millennia progressed, an improved climate for agriculture crept north, in excellent agreement with the bands on your map. The Middle East, where agriculture originated, became less and less suitable for agriculture, forcing the population to migrate north to greener pastures. STEPHEN H. BROWN  Princeton, N.J., May 12, 1991</p>
