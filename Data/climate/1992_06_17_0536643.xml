        <p>DEAR Diary:</p>
        <p>I chose lunch time the other afternoon as the occasion to propose to my girlfriend. The setting was easy to choose: the front steps of the Public Library at 42d and Fifth, where we met two years ago.</p>
        <p>That morning I'd gone into the Grand Hyatt, held up a bottle of Champagne and begged the front desk manager to keep it on ice for my brother to pick up and present to us after I popped the question. The ring was hidden on a bed of cotton inside a plastic deli salad-dressing container.</p>
        <p>After Erin said yes, the strangers around us applauded and offered congratulations. My brother appeared with the bubbly, which the hotel had iced, adorned with flowers and complemented with two champagne flutes. Then he took pictures of our toast and a first walk through a reborn Bryant Park as a betrothed couple.</p>
        <p>The following evening in Central Park a runner passed by and waved. "I was sitting behind you yesterday when you got engaged," she said. "Well done!"</p>
        <p>I love New York in June, how about you? -- DON GEHAN</p>
        <p>. . .</p>
        <p>FATHER'S DAY Like some stubble-faced King in his suburban court, I will rule this sunny Sunday with the pretense of paternal power. And my progeny, like royal subjects, will pretend that I am the regal ruler! Sermons from the college freshman on yuppie greed and the greenhouse effect will surcease</p>
        <p>and her high school sister will abandon that earringed boyfriend and the loud late-night music. All until tomorrow when I will surrender my crooked crown and, dethroned but still loved, accept the reality that daughters, not dads, possess the family royal ancestry. -- ROGER GRANET</p>
        <p>. . .</p>
        <p>Dear Diary:</p>
        <p>Walking past the main post office in Manhattan on a recent Wednesday evening at about 6:30, I noticed that the parking meters along Eighth Avenue were decorated with Police Department placards proclaiming "No Parking Friday." A series of orange cones had been placed in the street preventing motorists from parking at the curb.</p>
        <p>As I turned the corner into 33d Street I saw a young woman in civilian clothes engaged in putting up additional signs. I asked her if it was not a bit premature to be posting "No Parking Friday" signs on Wednesday and already blocking the streets to prevent parking.</p>
        <p>She replied that the prohibition would be taking effect at midnight that night. I suggested that it would then be only Thursday. "Well," she replied airily, "we ran out of 'No Parking Thursday' signs."</p>
        <p>I inquired whether motorists who parked their cars adjacent to these signs on Thursday would be towed away. "Of course," she said without batting an eye.</p>
        <p>What a remarkable city. --RICHARD A. NACHMAN</p>

        <p>The scene:</p>
        <p>British Airways plane heading to New York from Heathrow Airport.</p>
        <p>Dramatis personae:</p>
        <p>Two splendidly dressed women, both in their late 40's, both New Yorkers, and a third New Yorker who overhears their conversation.</p>
        <p>Woman 1:</p>
        <p>Did you have a great vacation?</p>
        <p>Woman 2:</p>
        <p>Well, it wasn't as terrific as I thought it would be. But that turned out to be the case with my marriage</p>
        <p>and</p>
        <p>my bridge club.</p>

        <p>Dear Diary:</p>
        <p>After too long an absence I recently moved back to New York. The other afternoon -- sunny, breezy, lovely -- I took a stroll along Broadway. A woman fell into step beside me. "I love this weather," she said. "It works against my hot flashes."</p>
        <p>I laughed, we started to talk, and I said I had just returned to Manhattan after 25 years in California. "Why?" she asked me, adding that she had been thinking of moving out there.</p>
        <p>So I told her how much I had missed the interaction of New York; that Los Angeles had no sense of community; that San Francisco had proven to be a more surprising disappointment, the city being strangely without heart, like a beautiful woman who got by on looks alone.</p>
        <p>I told her that for all New York's problems, I felt wonderfully warm returning here. We talked for several blocks until we reached my apartment building. I turned to say goodbye.</p>
        <p>"I'm really glad you decided to come back," she said.</p>
        <p>Me, too. You could live in California for 25 years without that kind of spontaneous interchange. --GWEN DAVIS</p>
        <p>. . .</p>
        <p>A friend writes:</p>
        <p>Like most of my contemporaries I can't believe I'm really past the half-century mark. Surely we don't look 50-plus.</p>
        <p>So there I was zipping down the West Side, tired after the long drive from upstate, eager to return the car to the garage. Too late I realized that I had slipped through a red light. Flashing lights appeared in the rear view mirror and an embarrassingly loud bullhorn commanded, "Make the turn and pull over to the curb."</p>
        <p>"Forty-first Street and 12th Avenue, the light was red when you went through," the officer said. "Let's see your registration, insurance card and driver's license." He looked at the photo on my license, then at me.</p>
        <p>"I've been a cop for seven years and I've never done this before. But your papers are all up to date, you've got your seat belt on and, well, you remind me of my mom. So I'm not going to give you a summons. Now be more careful in the future."</p>
        <p>His mom, I'm certain, is a</p>
        <p>most</p>
        <p>attractive woman.</p>
