        <p>As the Northeastern drought intensifies -- warm dry days followed by cold dry days -- jurisdictions around the region have begun to make plans for an official drought emergency, with mandatory restrictions in water use, even as they  fervently hope for wet weather. Except for the  cold and the leafless trees, the region's streams  and reservoirs have the look of a hot, dry summer about them, and it is still only the beginning of March.</p>
        <p>Even if rain appears this weekend, meteorologists believe that we will pull out of this drought slowly, too slowly to refill the reservoirs by early summer. Everyone hopes that spring, usually a very wet season, will bring normal rainfall. But nothing has been normal, weather-wise, in quite some time.</p>

        <p>As the Northeastern drought intensifies -- warm dry days followed by cold dry days -- jurisdictions around the region have begun to make plans for an official drought emergency, with mandatory restrictions in water use, even as they  fervently hope for wet weather. Except for the  cold and the leafless trees, the region's streams  and reservoirs have the look of a hot, dry summer about them, and it is still only the beginning of March.</p>
        <p>Even if rain appears this weekend, meteorologists believe that we will pull out of this drought slowly, too slowly to refill the reservoirs by early summer. Everyone hopes that spring, usually a very wet season, will bring normal rainfall. But nothing has been normal, weather-wise, in quite some time.</p>
        <p>A prolonged drought is a little like hard economic times, if only because it makes bad decisions and wasted opportunities so noticeable. Suddenly, the sources of water that are no longer available thanks to groundwater pollution or ill-considered development loom large in the overall water-supply picture. In a severe drought, they might have  made a difference. The same is true for patterns of water use that wouldn't seem profligate in years of normal moisture but that suddenly seem extravagant now.</p>
        <p>These days, every drought is read against the background of global warming. There is as yet no incontrovertible evidence of a connection between the two; what we do know is that, as with global warming, we are not without answers if we are willing to face the problem. One, obviously, is conservation. After a drought warning was issued last month, New Yorkers cut the city's water consumption by 30 million gallons a day.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, a sustained spring dousing, a few weeks of the soaking weather that makes everyone complain, would go a long way toward taking our minds off these worrying matters. It would certainly ease, for the moment, the worries of city planners, who have reopened wells in Queens and have been making contingency plans in the event of severe drought. But even if spring is wet and summer wetter, the long-range betting is on more dry times to come. Conservation should become a habit with us, conservation and a far more longsighted and imaginative use of an increasingly precious resource.</p>
