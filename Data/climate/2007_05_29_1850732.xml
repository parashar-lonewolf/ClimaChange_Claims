        <p>INTERNATIONAL A3-11</p>
        <p>Poverty Stricken Iraqis Turn to Selling Sex in Syria  For anyone living in Damascus, the fact that some Iraqi refugees are selling sex or working in sex clubs is difficult to ignore. Men freely talk of being approached by pimps trawling for customers and of women soliciting men directly, an act unthinkable in Arab culture. A1</p>
        <p>Iran and U.S. Talk Face to Face  The United States and Iran held rare face-to-face talks in Baghdad, adhering to an agenda that focused strictly on the war in Iraq and on ways they could help to improve conditions.  A8</p>
        <p>Spain Arrests 16 Moroccans  Spanish police arrested 16 men, most of them Moroccans, whom they suspect of recruiting volunteers to fight in Iraq and other countries and spreading propaganda calling for Islamic jihad.  A9</p>
        <p>Kazakh Leader's Kin Is Sought  Authorities in Kazakhstan have issued an international arrest warrant for Rakhat Aliyev, the son-in-law of President Nursultan A. Nazarbayev and one of the Central Asian oil state's most powerful and loathed men. A11</p>
        <p>Violence Spikes in Afghanistan  Angry supporters of Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum, the ethnic Uzbek strongman, clashed with the police in the northern town of Shiberghan, leaving at least seven people dead and 34 wounded, officials said. The government sent army units to the area, anticipating more unrest. A10</p>
        <p>Japan Minister Hangs Himself  Japan's agriculture minister, Toshikatsu Matsuoka, hanged himself just before he was to face parliamentary questioning about a political finance scandal. Analysts said the death could hurt Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's popularity ratings, which have fallen recently. A3</p>
        <p>NATIONAL A12-16</p>
        <p>Needle Exchange Program Alone in City's AIDS Fight  Washington is the only city in the country barred by federal law from using local tax money to finance needle exchange programs. It is also the city with the fastest-growing number of new AIDS cases. The city's only needle exchange program, Prevention Works, subsists on a shoestring budget of private donations.  A1</p>
        <p>For Sale: Uranium  Furious lobbying has broken out over who should end up with 25 million kilograms of uranium that the government is looking to sell. One of the companies most vocal in making its case for the uranium, estimated to be worth at least $750 million, says it should be given the material free.</p>
        <p>A12</p>
        <p>Cancer Genome Advance  Researchers say they have found six new sites of variation in the genome that increase the risk of breast cancer. Together with already known genes, the discovery means that much of the overall genetic risk of breast cancer may now have been accounted for, researchers say.</p>
        <p>A13</p>
        <p>Anger Over Immigration Deal  Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, a Republican who garners top ratings from conservative groups every year, is the unlikely linchpin to the fragile alliance of Democrats and Republicans trying to push the immigration bill through the Senate. That role has made Mr. Kyl into a lightining rod in the immigration debate.</p>
        <p>A14</p>
        <p>Bush Speaks at Arlington  President Bush used his traditional Memorial Day address at Arlington National Cemetery to speak directly, in deeply personal terms, to the families of soldiers killed in Iraq and Afghanistan, assuring them that Americans ''will never forget the terrible loss you have suffered.''</p>
        <p>A16</p>
        <p>NEW YORK/REGION B1-8</p>
        <p>Most Powerful Leaders In New York Are at Odds  Gov. Eliot Spitzer and the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, are like a dysfunctional power couple. The evidence of their antagonism has escalated into an extraordinarily public feud punctuated by ad hominem attacks and barbed sniping in the press. B1</p>
        <p>Mayor Critical of Congress  Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, in unusually pointed and broad language, criticized Congress for parts of a comprehensive immigration bill now being debated in the Senate.  B2</p>
        <p>BUSINESS DAY C1-8</p>
        <p>Push for Big Subsidies for Coal  Even as Congressional leaders draft legislation to reduce greenhouse gases linked to global warming, a powerful roster of Democrats and Republicans is pushing to subsidize coal as the king of ''alternative fuels.''</p>

        <p>Cyberwar in a Digital Age  When Estonian authorities began removing a statue of a Soviet soldier, they expected protests, but what followed was a series of cyber attacks that nearly crippled the government. Computer security experts have converged to offer help and to learn about cyberwar in the digital age.</p>
