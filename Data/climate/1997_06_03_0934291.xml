        <p>THE East and Gulf Coasts of the United States may be entering a long-anticipated, prolonged siege of more frequent and more destructive hurricanes, forecasters say.</p>
        <p>They predict that this summer, more hurricanes than normal will develop in the tropical North Atlantic for the third straight year. This would make 1995-97 the most active three-year period on record for the pinwheeling oceanic cyclones, and the experts say that could be only the beginning.</p>
        <p>The 1970's, 1980's and early 1990's were a time of relatively infrequent hurricanes. Those years did have their big storms: 7 of the 10 most costly hurricanes ever to strike the United States mainland did so over that stretch,  including Hurricane Andrew in 1992, the costliest ever.  But a new Federal study attributes the trend of escalating damage over that period to expanding population and exploding development rather than more frequent or powerful storms.</p>
        <p>Now the atmosphere and ocean appear to have entered a new and more ominous hurricane phase. Some experts believe the turbulent stretch beginning two years ago signifies a return to the 1940's, 1950's and 1960's, a period of high hurricane activity in the United States. If that is so, according to the new Federal study, the cost of damage wrought by hurricanes -- already the most expensive natural disasters in America -- could soar to new heights.</p>
        <p>Scientists offer varying explanations of what is responsible for the increase in hurricane frequency. One new study has found that sea-surface temperatures in 1995 were the highest on record in  the tropical North Atlantic. That year, 19 tropical storms and hurricanes, double the 1946-1995 average, formed in the Atlantic. The authors of the study concluded that warmer seas encouraged incipient hurricanes to develop by infusing them with more energy. Temperatures in the region of hurricane births, between 10 degrees and 20 degrees north latitude, have remained above average since 1995.</p>
        <p>Coincidentally or not, 1995 also saw the highest average global surface temperatures on record, and some scientists say this raises the possibility that global warming is contributing to the increased frequency of hurricanes. The coincidence ''is suggestive of some link to global warming, but that needs to be proved,'' said Dr. Mark A. Saunders,  chief author of the study. It is ''just one of the possibilities,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Other say that global warming is almost certainly not the cause. One is Dr. William M. Gray, an atmospheric scientist and hurricane expert at Colorado State University in Fort Collins. The rise in sea temperature ''is not related to the warming of the planet,'' he said, noting that global warming has been slow, while the Atlantic sea-surface temperature jumped in a matter of months.</p>
        <p>It was Dr. Gray and his group of researchers who correctly predicted that 1995 would be one of the most active seasons on record, although they underestimated 1996. In April,  the group forecast that 1997 would also bring more hurricanes than average, including the more intense ones. These major storms are defined as those with peak sustained winds of more than 110 miles an hour, and they account for 75 percent of all hurricane damage. Lesser hurricanes have peak winds of at least 74 miles an hour.</p>
        <p>The forecasters predicted that the 1997 hurricane season, which officially began on Sunday and lasts through November, would produce 7 hurricanes, 3 of which would be in the intense category, and 4 lesser tropical storms strong enough to be  named. By comparison, 11 of the 19 named storms in 1995 were hurricanes, 5 of them severe; last year, 9 of the 13 named storms were hurricanes and 6 were severe.</p>
        <p>The Colorado group's forecast applies to an area encompassing the Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. It is to be updated on Friday, but Dr. Gray said the update was not expected to depart substantially from the April prediction. The forecasters do not attempt to predict whether or where any of the hurricanes will strike land.</p>
        <p>The forecasts are based on an array of predictive signs and atmospheric phenomena that Dr. Gray has identified as determining hurricane activity. One is the amount of rainfall in the Sahel region of western Africa, where the small areas of low pressure that are the embryos of hurricanes first form. When the Sahel is wetter, Dr. Gray found, more embryos form. This year, the Sahel is wet.</p>
        <p>Another factor is the phenomenon known as El Nino, the huge pool of warm water that develops every two  to seven years in the eastern tropical Pacific, changing weather patterns around the world. When it is in place, high-level winds blowing from the west tend to shear off the tops of developing hurricanes in the adjacent Atlantic, causing them to abort.  El Nino may make an appearance later this year, forecasters say, but the Colorado group predicts that it will not do so in time to affect the hurricane picture.</p>
        <p>Other elements include the behavior of stratospheric winds that circle the globe high above the equator and weather features far remote from the Atlantic hurricane belt -- things, for example, like the temperature high above Singapore. On balance, the forecasters say, the indicators point to higher-than-average activity this year.</p>
        <p>One of the most powerful indicators, according to the new study by Dr. Saunders and Andrew R. Harris, climate scientists at University College London in Britain, is the Atlantic sea-surface temperature. Their statistical analysis found that while most of the relevant factors were indeed favorable for hurricane development in the banner year of 1995, the dominating influence was the unusually warm ocean. The temperature in the region where hurricanes develop was 1.2 degrees Fahrenheit above the 1946-1995 average, a record. The development region was 0.36 of a degree warmer than average last year and is about 0.9 of a degree warmer now. This, said Dr. Saunders, presages another active season. His study appeared in the May 15 issue of the journal Geophysical Research Letters.</p>
        <p>The researchers suggest that warmer seas cause more water to evaporate from the surface. With evaporation, latent heat is released in the atmosphere, and the researchers believe that this is what imparts more energy to the embryonic storms coming out of Africa, making it more likely that they will develop into hurricanes. ''It seems that this is a stronger effect that any other mechanism, like El Nino or the monsoon in the western Sahel,'' Dr. Saunders said.</p>
        <p>The question, he said, is whether the rising sea temperature is a natural expression of the climate system's variability, independent of any influence from a warming atmosphere. Dr. Gray, for his part, says he believes the warmer ocean temperature is ''a manifestation of a major change in North Atlantic ocean circulation.'' Stately currents in the North Atlantic undergo periodic shifts on decadal time scales. Dr. Gray said he believed that a new pattern was in place, and that it was likely to presage a decade or two of above-average hurricane activity.</p>
        <p>''This is the greatest fear we have,'' he said, ''that we're entering a new era. I believe we are.''</p>
        <p>If so, the new Federal study on hurricane damage may offer a preview of what lies ahead. In the study, Dr. Roger Pielke Jr. of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., and Dr. Christopher Landsea of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's hurricane research division in Miami calculated how much damage would result from past hurricanes if they had occurred in 1995, when the coasts held many more people and much more wealth than earlier.</p>
        <p>The calculation, which also accounts for inflation, shows that if the more numerous storms of the very active quarter-century prior to 1970 were to hit the mainland now, each of the storms would cause far more damage than it did back then.</p>
        <p>It has been suggested in the past that escalating hurricane damage in more recent decades has resulted from an increase in the number and severity of storms. The Pielke-Landsea analysis found this is not so. In fact, when all hurricane damage was  assessed as if it had occurred in 1995, the four biggest hurricanes of the last eight years were no longer the most damaging in history. Andrew, which exacted an all-time record $26.5 billion in actual damages, was  downgraded to second place by a monster that struck Florida and Alabama in 1926. Hugo (1989), Opal (1995) and Fran (1996) slip far down the list.</p>
        <p>The analysis, its authors wrote, indicates clearly ''that the United States has been fortunate in recent decades with regard to storm losses.'' Now, they wrote, multibillion-dollar losses may become increasingly frequent, and it may be ''only a matter of time'' before a single storm exacts $50 billion in damages.</p>
