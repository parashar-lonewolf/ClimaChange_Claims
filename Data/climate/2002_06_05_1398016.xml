        <p>Under intense criticism from conservatives, President Bush distanced himself today from a report by his administration concluding that humans were to blame for far-reaching effects of global warming on the environment.</p>
        <p>The report, drafted by the Environmental Protection Agency and reviewed by several other agencies and the White House, was sent to the United Nations early last week. The report said the United States would be substantially changed in the next few decades by global warming, although it called for no rapid response. Reporters asked Mr. Bush about the report today.</p>
        <p>''I read the report put out by the bureaucracy,'' he said. He said he still opposed the Kyoto treaty, which Japan ratified today. The treaty calls for the mandatory reduction of greenhouse gases by industrial nations.</p>
        <p>Critics across the political spectrum said that Mr. Bush was trying to appear more moderate to environmentalists while signaling to conservatives and industry that he would not promote the views contained in the report.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's spokesman emphasized that the report carried numerous caveats about the uncertainty that still exists about the science of climate change.</p>
        <p>Ari Fleischer, the spokesman, obviously anticipating a question about the report at the daily White House briefing, said: ''There is 'considerable uncertainty' -- that's in this recent report -- relating to the science of climate change. This report submitted to the United Nations also recognizes that any 'definitive prediction of potential outcomes is not yet feasible' and that 'one of the weakest links in our knowledge is the connection between global and regional predictions of climate change.' ''</p>
        <p>Instead of the Kyoto treaty, Mr. Bush has called for voluntary measures that would allow gas emissions to continue to rise, with the goal of slowing the rate of growth.</p>
        <p>But in this report, the administration said for the first time that the United States would be significantly affected by global warming in the next few decades. The report alarmed conservatives and representatives of various industries, especially utilities that rely on old technologies, and they accused Mr. Bush of flip-flopping on an important issue.</p>
        <p>Rush Limbaugh, the conservative radio talk-show host, today called Mr. Bush ''George W. Al Gore,'' a reference to former Vice President Al Gore, who has long been concerned about global warming. But the moniker seemed to be an effort to deride Mr. Bush for adopting what many conservatives view as Mr. Gore's environmental extremism and to compliment the president for undercutting Mr. Gore on his signature issue.</p>
        <p>''All of this takes Al Gore's No. 1 issue away from him,'' Mr. Limbaugh told listeners. He predicted that the Senate majority leader, Senator Tom Daschle, Democrat of South Dakota, and the House minority leader, Representative Richard A. Gephardt, Democrat of Missouri, would be ''banging their heads against the wall'' because the report might pre-empt them from making a political issue of global warming.</p>
        <p>Christopher C. Horner, a lawyer in Washington and senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a conservative research group, said today that Mr. Bush had distanced himself from the report ''because of concern from the right that he was going to accept the European environmental world view, that he had changed his mind as the report indicated he had.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Horner said Mr. Bush could not possibly accept the premise of the report without also saying that the United States would do something about it. ''It was obvious to him that it's not tenable to say yes, we're aggressively killing the planet and then not do something aggressive about it,'' he said. ''Our fear was that he would have to take severe action,'' after years of promising that he would not.</p>
        <p>But he said Mr. Bush was now in more of a bind because he could not dismiss the report as the product of bureaucrats without responding to it. The implication in Mr. Bush's dismissal, he said, was, ''There goes Governor Whitman again,'' a reference to Christie Whitman, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, who has sometimes been at odds with Mr. Bush over approaches to environmental problems.</p>
        <p>Joe Martyak, a spokesman for Mrs. Whitman, said that was an incorrect interpretation. The report said nothing new, Mr. Martyak said, and Mrs. Whitman ''agrees with the president that his plan is the best approach to dealing with greenhouse gasses.''</p>
        <p>Phil Clapp, president of the National Environmental Trust, said that Mr. Bush's response today reflected the difficult political position the report put him in. ''This is the same naked politics that this administration has exhibited on every major environmental issue,'' Mr. Clapp said.</p>
