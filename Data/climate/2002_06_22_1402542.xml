        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska says that no place is experiencing more startling change from rising temperatures than his state (''Alaska, No Longer So Frigid, Starts to Crack, Burn and Sag,'' front page, June 16).</p>
        <p>He cites sagging roads, crumbling villages, dead forests, catastrophic fires and possible disruption of marine wildlife. He says mitigating the effects will cost Alaska hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>
        <p>It's likely Mr. Stevens will ask American taxpayers to help foot the bill. Before we open our wallets, we should ask Mr. Stevens and the rest of the Alaska delegation to halt their push for drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which continues our dependence on fossil fuels, and their attack on sensible increases in car and truck fuel efficiency standards, which would reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
