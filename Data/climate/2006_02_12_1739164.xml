        <p>KICKED OUT</p>
        <p>The News -- Zacarias Moussaoui, who is on trial in a federal court in Virginia for involvement in the Sept. 11 attacks, was ejected from the courtroom during jury selection.</p>
        <p>Behind the News -- Mr. Moussaoui has pleaded guilty to six counts of conspiracy, but claims he was not part of the Sept. 11 plot. The trial is only to determine if he should be executed or serve a life term. His lawyers may try to show that he is mentally unstable; Mr. Moussaoui may have helped his cause by shouting ''I am Al Qaeda'' to each of four groups of prospective jurors.</p>
        <p>NO VACANCY</p>
        <p>The News -- Evacuees from Hurricane Katrina were told to leave 4,500 hotel rooms the federal government had been paying for since the disaster six months ago.</p>
        <p>Behind the News -- The emergency housing program cost hundreds of millions of dollars. Evacuees occupying an additional 20,000 rooms were given a reprieve of at least a week. But a new housing crisis loomed as a $4 billion program to provide trailers to displaced families remained far short of its goal. Officials said it would take at least three more months to fill all 135,000 requests.</p>
        <p>LEFT THE OFFICE</p>
        <p>The News -- A NASA press aide resigned after it was disclosed that he did not have a journalism degree as claimed on his résumé, and the top television executive at the Corporation for Public Broadcasting announced he would step down.</p>
        <p>Behind the News -- The NASA aide, George C. Deutsch, 24, got the job after working on President Bush's re-election campaign. In recent weeks, he and other political appointees at NASA had been criticized for trying to limit journalists' access to a climate scientist who has called for aggressive efforts to counter global warming. The critics see a broader pattern of the administration asserting political control over scientific information.</p>
        <p>At the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the departure of Michael Pack was viewed as a sign that the corporation is trying to stem the rise of ideological viewpoints within management. Mr. Pack's resignation follows those by a number of executives and consultants who had tried to counter what they saw as the organization's liberal bias. The internal strife had threatened to undermine financial support for public television from Congress and private sources.</p>
        <p>EARLY RETIREMENT</p>
        <p>The News -- The Bronx Zoo announced it would end its elephant exhibit when one or two of its three animals dies.</p>
        <p>Behind the News -- Zoos around the country have closed or are planning to phase out their elephant exhibits. The animals don't take particularly well to captivity -- they need a lot of space, prefer to live in matriarchal groups of six or more and are easily stressed when newcomers arrive. Zoo patrons don't have to worry about saying goodbye to the elephants anytime soon, though. The beasts are in their mid-30's and could easily live for several decades more.</p>
