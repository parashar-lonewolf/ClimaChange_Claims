        <p>Stretched by the rising cost of fighting terrorism and its large budget deficit, the United States dropped to second from first in the annual ranking of global economic competitiveness.</p>
        <p>The cost of fighting terrorism and the war in Iraq and its effect on American economic competitiveness were measured by the survey in everything from delays caused by security checkpoints in buildings and airports to the longer-term effect of discouraging foreign students from earning graduate degrees here.</p>
        <p>The United States' ranking also suffered for failing to comply with international agreements, inefficient public spending and allowing political donations to affect policy decisions.</p>
        <p>But the biggest problem is the budget deficit caused in part by the costs of the war and new domestic security, said Augusto Lopez-Claros, chief economist and the author of the report for the World Economic Forum.</p>
        <p>''The war in Iraq and on terrorism will have a large financial impact, showing up in the deficits and the costs of doing business in the United States, especially more red tape and reduced efficiency,'' Mr. Lopez-Claros said in an interview from London.</p>
        <p>In contrast, European and Asian nations were the bright spots in the survey.</p>
        <p>The survey is based on interviews with business leaders and entrepreneurs in 102 countries as well as publicly available economic data. The World Economic Forum, a global assembly of officials from boardrooms and governments best known for its gatherings at the Swiss ski resort of Davos, conducts the survey to determine why some countries are competitive year after year while others stumble.</p>
        <p>Finland headed the list as the most competitive nation, scoring at the top across the board, from enrollment rates in universities to the ability of companies to absorb new technology.</p>
        <p>The countries in Eastern and Central European that are joining the European Union next year showed significant progress, according to the survey. Simply by fulfilling the requirements for membership in the European Union, these countries made the changes necessary to jump up the competitive ladder.</p>
        <p>''The tough demands for membership have paid off even before they join,'' Mr. Lopez-Claros said.</p>
        <p>With this year's solid performance, Asian countries seemed to have put the financial crisis of the mid-1990's behind them.</p>
        <p>In the survey, Taiwan ranked fifth and Singapore sixth, showings that reflected how the high-performing nations of Asia had not only recovered from the financial crisis, but surged ahead. Taiwan and Singapore both moved up one spot from last year.</p>
        <p>Korea is a stark example. Five years ago, amid talk of a depression in Asia, South Korea underwent an austerity program dictated in large part by Washington and the International Monetary Fund in return for rescue packages. South Korea was struggling to replenish its dwindling foreign currency accounts and workers were striking against proposed layoffs.</p>
        <p>Today the country is ranked 18th, an improvement by three positions from last year's competitive list, with high rates of university enrollment, top-quality Internet service providers as well as improvements in public institutions and public expenditures.</p>
        <p>''Korea is a very classic example of the importance of consistent reforms,'' Mr. Lopez-Claros said.</p>
        <p>For similar reasons, Chile emerged as the most competitive nation in Latin America, Botswana in Africa and Jordan in the Middle East.</p>
        <p>For the United States, the world's biggest economy, several signs were troubling even though it ranks as the second most competitive.</p>
        <p>The American government's refusal to comply with some international agreements is working against American businesses, according to the survey, which listed agreements covering global warming, the prosecution of war criminals and international trade.</p>
        <p>''If you're working in an international economy,'' Mr. Lopez-Claros said, ''but in one of your markets a government is choosy in terms of which international agreements it will comply with, it will make you hesitant to do business there.''</p>
        <p>In the survey, he said, inefficient public spending in the United States referred in large part to the $19 billion in annual agricultural subsidies provided by the government. Japan and several European nations were also criticized for the large share of public money spent on agricultural subsidies.</p>
        <p>American business leaders also said they were concerned about the undue influence of legal political donations on important policy decisions.</p>
        <p>''There seems to be a sense there is too much influence there, that they are asked to contribute a lot of money,'' Mr. Lopez-Claros said. ''In other countries, like Denmark, there isn't a problem like this.''</p>
