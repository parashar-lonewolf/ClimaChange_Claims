        <p>LEAD: The average cow belches up to 400 liters of methane a day, a situation that worsens the global greenhouse effect and ought to be curbed, a Colorado State University scientist says.</p>
        <p>The average cow belches up to 400 liters of methane a day, a situation that worsens the global greenhouse effect and ought to be curbed, a Colorado State University scientist says.</p>
        <p>The greenhouse warming of the Earth's atmosphere is caused mainly by carbon dioxide in the air, much of it generated by the burning of fossil fuels. Carbon dioxide traps solar energy and raises global temperatures.</p>
        <p>But scientists have recently discovered that methane, commonly produced by fermenting vegetation, also contributes strongly to climatic warming. A large share of the methane released into the atmosphere comes from the chemical degradation of cellulose in the guts of termites, rodents, ungulates and other eaters of wood and straw.</p>
        <p>The methane molecule, consisting of one atom of carbon and four of hydrogen, is produced in environments where no oxygen is available, as in the rumens of cattle. The rumen is a separate compartment of a cow's stomach, where cellulose is broken down by symbiotic bacteria into digestible cud and methane gas.</p>
        <p>The production of methane in the rumen can be greatly reduced by feeding cattle substances called ionophores, which Dr. Johnson described as ''weak, selective antibiotics.'' These substances, already widely used in the feeding of beef cattle, selectively inhibit the reproduction of methane-producing bacteria in the gut, leaving room for other bacteria that help digestion more efficiently.</p>
        <p>Ionophores are not ordinarily used with dairy and other cattle, however. Dr. Johnson believes that other possibilities for reducing methane production should be developed.</p>
        <p>He believes that certain protozoa and fungi that do not produce methane could be developed as digestive microorganisms that could effectively compete with methane-producing bacteria. Applied on a global scale, such solutions might significantly ameliorate the greenhouse problem, Dr. Johnson believes.</p>
