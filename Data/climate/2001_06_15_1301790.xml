        <p>President Bush and European leaders expressed sharp differences and conflicting intentions today about global warming at a summit meeting of the European Union and the United States.</p>
        <p>It was Mr. Bush's first appearance at a European Union meeting, and his first introduction to several of the leaders, but it was also the second day in a row that he found himself at odds with European officials. On Wednesday, he clashed with leaders of the Atlantic Alliance on his plans for a missile defense shield. And that contentious issue is certain to come up again when he concludes his five-day, five-nation trip on Saturday with a meeting with Russian President Vladimir V. Putin.</p>
        <p>In today's meetings, the leaders of the European Union seemed intent on starting their relationship on a respectful note, using a studiously cordial tone and carefully measured words.</p>
        <p>Even so, Mr. Bush and the Europeans laid bare their split over the wisdom of a 1997 treaty, known as the Kyoto Protocol, to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. At least publicly, European leaders say they will press ahead with the accord, while Mr. Bush remains firmly opposed to it.</p>
        <p>As leaders on each side defended their positions today, the statements underscored tensions in the relationship between the United States and Europe and European leaders' fears that Mr. Bush was marching resolutely to his own drummer as he dealt with foreign policy issues of common concern.</p>
        <p>''We don't agree on the Kyoto treaty,'' Mr. Bush bluntly stated at a news conference here after talks with Prime Minister Goran Persson of Sweden and the president of the European Commission , Romano Prodi. ''But we do agree that climate change is a serious issue and we must work together.''</p>
        <p>Later Mr. Bush added, ''I say loud and clear that our nation is willing to lead on this issue.'' Nonetheless, he said, ''We didn't feel like the Kyoto treaty was well balanced. It didn't include developing nations. Its goals were not realistic.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Persson and Mr. Prodi, speaking at the same news conference, offered dissenting assessments.</p>
        <p>''The European Union will stick to the Kyoto Protocol and go for a ratification process,'' Mr. Persson said. ''The U.S. has chosen another policy.''</p>
        <p>In what came across as a gentle rebuke of Mr. Bush, Mr. Persson added that ''climate change is not isolated'' to Europe and is a global threat. ''So, nevertheless, if you are in favor or against the Kyoto Protocol, you have to take action,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The Kyoto accord would require industrialized nations to cut emissions of greenhouse gases below 1990 levels, a year that the Bush administration has said was chosen to make achieving compliance easier for certain European countries than for the United States.</p>
        <p>Neither the United States nor any country in the European Union subsequently ratified the treaty, and administration officials said that was in part because some European governments, despite statements of support designed to please voters with environmental concerns, had their own reservations.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Bush and Mr. Prodi were asked why European countries had not moved faster, Mr. Bush said, ''I think that's a good question.'' And there was a hint of disbelief on the president's face when Mr. Prodi subsequently said that every country would indeed ratify and that the ''process will start soon.''</p>
        <p>The divergence over Kyoto is just one symbol of various issues on which European leaders believe that the Bush administration is not sensitive to their concerns. And it was not the only way in which the third day of Mr. Bush's first overseas trip was a tough one.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush seemed muted during the news conference and gave several erroneous, unclear or unwelcome characterizations of the issues he was addressing.</p>
        <p>He said at one point during the news conference that ''Europe ought to include nations beyond the current scope of E.U. and NATO'' and that ''my vision of Europe is a larger vision'' that included ''more countries.''</p>
        <p>He appeared to be advocating expansion of the European Union, which was to be discussed by the 15 member nations on Friday and Saturday. And his remarks prompted a stern response from Chris Patten, the union's external affairs commissioner, who said pointedly, ''The United States is not a member of the European Union.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, turning his attention to another continent, told reporters, ''We spent a lot of time talking about Africa, and we should. Africa is a nation that suffers from incredible disease.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush had unwaveringly stated his opposition to the Kyoto agreement before he left Washington earlier this week for his first overseas trip as president, which will continue in Poland on Friday and conclude in Slovenia on Saturday when he meets Mr. Putin.</p>
        <p>During that meeting, Mr. Bush is certain to debate another issue that has already been a contentious one during his European trip -- his desire to abandon the ABM Treaty between Moscow and Washington.</p>
        <p>The Bush administration's position is that it wants to work to cut emissions by leading the world in the research and development of technologies that will combat global warming without hurting American industries and the country's economy.</p>
        <p>While the European dissatisfaction with that was stated in relatively polite terms today by Mr. Persson and Mr. Prodi, it is seriously felt, and administration officials acknowledged that it was a more divisive disagreement than the one over the missile treaty.</p>
        <p>And the nature and depth of the suspicion among some Europeans feel toward Mr. Bush -- a sentiment that other new American presidents have also faced -- was suggested by a statement by Mr. Persson to antiglobalization protesters on Wednesday, before Mr. Bush arrived here.</p>
        <p>Referring to the European Union, Mr. Persson said, ''It's one of the few institutions we can develop as a balance to U.S. world domination.''</p>
