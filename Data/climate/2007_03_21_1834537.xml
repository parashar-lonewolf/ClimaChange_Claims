        <p>Among the hawks in the Bush administration, Robert Joseph long occupied a special perch.</p>
        <p>As the architect of much of the administration's strategy for countering nuclear proliferation, he helped engineer the decision to exit the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, worked secretly to squeeze Libya to give up its nuclear weapons program, and created a loose consortium of nations, now numbering more than 80, committed to intercepting illicit weapons at sea, in the air or on land.</p>
        <p>But last month Mr. Joseph quietly left the State Department, where he was under secretary for arms control and international security, telling colleagues that, as a matter of principle, he simply could not abide the new agreement with North Korea that the Bush administration struck in February.</p>
        <p>Mr. Joseph has declined to talk publicly about why he left, but he told colleagues that he thought the deal would prolong the survival of a North Korean government he has publicly called ''criminal'' and ''morally abhorrent'' while failing to require it to give up the weapons it has already produced. In an interview, Mr. Joseph made clear that he ''does not support the policy'' that President Bush has now embraced.</p>
        <p>''The approach I would have endorsed was to continue to put pressure on the regime,'' Mr. Joseph added.</p>
        <p>He is among the last of the hawks to turn off the lights and walk away from an administration that many conservatives say has lost its clarity of mission. He insists he is leaving without rancor and without regrets, including for his role in assessing the weapons intelligence about Iraq. ''I do share the recognition that there was an intelligence failure, but it wasn't just a failure of the Bush administration,'' he said. ''Look, if we press too hard we are accused of politicizing the intelligence; if we don't press, then we are not doing our job.''</p>
        <p>The departure of Mr. Joseph and others has been welcomed by officials, mostly in the State Department, who believe the administration's hawks blocked opportunities for negotiated settlements. They have celebrated a distinct change in the tone and actions of the administration, now so enmeshed in Iraq that it has neither the time nor the appetite for the agenda to remake the world that dominated its first term. To the departed hawks, the administration has simply lost its moorings.</p>
        <p>Some, like Mr. Joseph's predecessor at the State Department, John R. Bolton, the former ambassador to the United Nations, have taken to the airwaves, denouncing the North Korea accord specifically, and what they view as a general drift toward compromise, a post-Iraq overemphasis on caution.</p>
        <p>Others, including Donald H. Rumsfeld, the former defense secretary; Paul D. Wolfowitz, Stephen A. Cambone and Douglas J. Feith, Mr. Rumsfeld's former deputies; and I. Lewis Libby Jr., Vice President Dick Cheney's former chief of staff, have remained silent. Mr. Wolfowitz has used his position as president of the World Bank to turn to other issues; others are writing books or articles defending the use of intelligence or their role in the decision to invade Iraq.</p>
        <p>Some hawks remain. Mr. Cheney is the most prominent, of course, and by all accounts he is as unyielding as ever in the administration's internal debates. But his public statements are often more muted than before the Iraq war, when he argued that toppling Saddam Hussein would remake the Middle East.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney is supported by a dwindling band of loyalists, including John Hannah, who succeeded Mr. Libby as the vice president's national security adviser but seems to wield little of his clout.</p>
        <p>At the White House, J. D. Crouch, the deputy national security adviser, who headed the group that devised the administration's strategy to increase troops in Iraq, and Elliott Abrams, who leads global democracy strategy, are known for their relatively hawkish views. Mr. Abrams has assembled a team pressing internally to step up pressure on Iran, a strategy Mr. Bush has endorsed as a way to gain leverage over Tehran.</p>
        <p>But that was considered a rare victory. ''With the exception of a few -- including the vice president -- the hawks have returned to their nests,'' said one of Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice's top aides who viewed Mr. Joseph and others as seeking to block the give and take of negotiations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Joseph, now 57 and preparing for a life as a speaker, consultant and part-time presidential envoy on proliferation issues, is careful not to criticize either Mr. Bush or Ms. Rice, both of whom he says he admires. But he declares as a fact what many still inside the administration will not: Iraq has taken the steel out of the administration's diplomacy in the second term.</p>
        <p>''Iraq,'' Mr. Joseph said over lunch last week, shortly after he left his job, ''inhibits taking actions that could be perceived as provocative.'' He and his former colleagues wonder whether many of the actions that came to define Mr. Bush's first term -- when they scrapped the ABM treaty, walked away from the Kyoto Protocol on climate change and raised pre-emptive strikes to the status of a doctrine in the first National Security Strategy -- would happen today.</p>
        <p>In the first term, as he moved between his office at the National Security Council and frequent meetings with Mr. Bush and Ms. Rice, then the national security adviser, Mr. Joseph's influence was evident in a wide constellation of issues.</p>
        <p>''The first term was a running battle between the hawks and the middle, and Bob was always there,'' said Michael Green, who ran Asian affairs at the National Security Council and is now at Georgetown University. Mr. Joseph turned out reams of position papers, arguing for deeper sanctions against the likes of Kim Jong-il of North Korea or the Iranian mullahs. Ms. Rice usually signed on.</p>
        <p>When Ms. Rice declared four years ago that ''we don't want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud,'' she was giving rhetorical edge to positions Mr. Joseph helped sketch out. Similarly, her dismissal of a French effort to give inspectors in Iraq more time -- ''the worst of both worlds,'' she said -- matched views he was expressing in interviews at the time.</p>
        <p>In the second term, Mr. Joseph arrived at the State Department to discover a changed dynamic. Ms. Rice's first imperative was to restore relations with allies, particularly in Europe, who had parted with the administration on the war. Over the past 26 months, she appears to have steadily edged back to the realist school that she was identified with for years before signing on to Mr. Bush's presidential campaign in the late 1990s.</p>
        <p>Some of her former colleagues argue that Ms. Rice has let the State Department change her, rather than the other way around.</p>
        <p>Asked about that, Mr. Bolton, who moved to the American Enterprise Institute after it was clear his time as ambassador to the United Nations could not be extended, paused for a moment and said, ''I think I will take a pass on that one.''</p>
        <p>But he quickly added: ''I would say that the difference is that the bureaucracy is now getting what it wanted on Jan. 21, 2001.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Joseph's own trajectory in the administration seems symbolic of the changes that have taken place.</p>
        <p>He came to the administration brimming with ideas about ''counterproliferation,'' a more muscular approach to ending trade in the world's most dangerous weapons than the Clinton administration and its predecessors had followed. One of his first tasks was to devise a strategy to get out of the ABM treaty, and answer critics who argued it would revive an arms race with Russia. Instead, the administration helped create a new treaty, signed in 2002, committing both sides to reduce the size of their arsenals, though it leaves thousands of warheads in storage.</p>
        <p>''No one even thinks about the ABM treaty anymore, which is a true measure of success,'' Mr. Joseph said.</p>
        <p>Inside the White House, he drafted a new policy for aggressively pursuing trade in unconventional weapons, one that goes far beyond export controls. It became the ''Proliferation Security Initiative,'' a plan now supported by both Democrats and Republicans that creates a web of countries that use their national laws to cooperate in intercepting shipments.</p>
        <p>When the new effort hit early pay dirt in the fall of 2003, intercepting a cargo ship bound for Libya with nuclear centrifuges built by Abdul Qadeer Khan's nuclear smuggling network, it led to Mr. Joseph's biggest success: working with American and British intelligence officials to persuade Libya to give up its nuclear program, which helped break up Mr. Khan's network.</p>
        <p>He had a personal stake in the Libya negotiations: In 1988, Mr. Joseph had nearly taken Pan Am Flight 103, which Libyan terrorists blew up, and in his dealings with the Libyans he said he periodically saw the faces of the passengers whom he watched waiting to board that plane in London.</p>
        <p>He said growing up in an Arab-American family in North Dakota ''provided an advantage'' as he sat across the table from the Libyans, telling them that they would only see better relations with the United States after they gave up their entire nuclear program. Incremental steps, he told them, would not be sufficient.</p>
        <p>That is clearly the aggressive model Mr. Joseph would like to see used with North Korea and Iran. In his first days at the State Department in 2005, he drafted a paper entitled ''Defensive Measures for North Korea,'' and when the United States succeeded in closing down a bank that North Korea used for a number of illicit transactions, he argued that similar techniques would bring pain to Tehran.</p>
        <p>But he did not play a central role in devising negotiating strategies with either country. That was put into the hands of career diplomats, Christopher R. Hill in the case of North Korea, and R. Nicholas Burns in the case of Iran, while Mr. Joseph devised the administration's new ''global initiative to combat nuclear terrorism.''</p>
        <p>Last fall, he argued vociferously against ending the action to seize illicit North Korean funds in order to get to a broader arms agreement. When he was overruled, he left the administration. ''Pressure is essential,'' Mr. Joseph said, ''if diplomacy is to have any chance of success.''</p>
