        <p>LEAD: When it comes to recycling, manufacturers of consumer products are doing what comes easily. Impressive amounts of their readily reusable products are being recycled: 25 percent of all paper, 25 percent of glass bottles, 55 percent of aluminum cans and 66 percent of all steel.</p>
        <p>When it comes to recycling, manufacturers of consumer products are doing what comes easily. Impressive amounts of their readily reusable products are being recycled: 25 percent of all paper, 25 percent of glass bottles, 55 percent of aluminum cans and 66 percent of all steel.</p>
        <p>But the surging movement for household recycling, which requires relatively pure and simple products and packages, is colliding with consumer demand for highly processed products and elaborate packaging.</p>
        <p>Now, more and more consumer products and packages are being made of materials that are difficult or impossible to recycle. But in coming years manufacturers will be testing the strength of public officials' commitment to recycling as well as assessing the changing needs and attitudes of consumers moving from a society that throws away materials toward one that recycles them.</p>
        <p>''It's probably unfair at this point to say that industries haven't done enough to detoxify their products and promote recycling,'' said Dr. Allen Hershkowitz, a senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council in New York. ''It's only within the past two years that they have had a mandate from regulators and consumers.''</p>
        <p>In recent months some manufacturers of products that cause the most environmental harm in landfills or incinerators - plastics, paints, dry-cell batteries, tires - have begun to remove some toxic substances from their products.</p>
        <p>Manufacturers are also beginning to market ''green products,'' already widely available in England and Canada, that are made from recycled materials, or are themselves recyclable or biodegradable, or that minimize waste. For example, the Scotch Corporation, a chemical manufacturer in Dallas, has just introduced plastic pouches of concentrated household cleaners that consumers can mix with water and use to refill empty 22-ounce spray bottles.  Consumers' Needs  Home Recyclers Find Few Aids in Stores</p>
        <p>Generally, however, producers and retailers have ignored the practical problems faced by consumers who must organize their garbage.</p>
        <p>''I don't think companies are doing anything to make recycling easier,'' said Barb Whittemore, a registered nurse who lives in Hamburg, N.Y., a suburb of Buffalo that has had a mandatory recycling program for several years. She especially dislikes cleaning small containers and removing labels. ''I have to spend a long time soaking, dipping and dunking bottles with skinny little necks,'' Mrs. Whittemore said. ''I get really mad at Heinz 57 Steak Sauce bottles.''</p>
        <p>''We just put our recyclability task force into place in the middle of June,'' said Beth Adams, a spokeswoman for Heinz U.S.A., a division of the H. J. Heinz Company. ''We have not attacked specific consumer issues yet.''</p>
        <p>Michael J. Rourke, a spokesman for the Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Company, said that stores in communities that recycle have not noticed any change in consumer demand and that the company has not conducted any consumer research on recycling.</p>
        <p>Bret Peters, a spokesman for the Fund for Renewable Energy and the Environment in Washington, said, ''There isn't one store I know of that carries a wide variety of products to help people with the mechanics of recycling.''</p>
        <p>So far such products remain the province of small suppliers like Seventh Generation, a mail-order house that sells products for organizing garbage, like can crushers and aluminum carts holding 20-gallon tubs with tight lids. Alan S. Newman started the company last year. His first 200,000 catalogues were so successful that now he is preparing to mail 500,000 new catalogues, which cost $2 and list 250 products.</p>
        <p>The company, at 10 Farrell Street, South Burlington, Vt. 05403, takes its name from a passage in the Iroquois confederation's Great Law of Peace: ''In our every deliberation, we must consider the impact of our decisions on the next seven generations.''</p>
        <p>But most manufacturers and retailers have paid lip service to the solid-waste problem by offering things like biodegradable disposable diapers and plastic bags that have little chance of decomposing in tightly packed and sealed landfills.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, many manufacturers are switching from recyclable glass containers to plastic ones, which, though theoretically recyclable, are not yet widely collected except for soda bottles that are redeemed for deposits. ''I have switched brand after brand of peanut butter to keep with glass containers,'' Mrs. Whittemore said, ''but now it's at the point where everything is plastic.''  Industries' Responses  Laws and Markets Are Hard to Predict</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, environmentalists and experts on solid waste are satisfied that recycling is now on the agenda of nearly every major company in the nation. Marketing specialists confirm that product changes, research projects and pilot programs are starting up almost daily. The driving force is the threat of legislation that would require companies to take more responsibility for the disposal of their products. The Federal Environmental Protection Agency, after ending its effort to foster recycling in 1983, re-established it 18 months ago.</p>
        <p>Its goals are to increase the volume of recycled waste to 25 percent in 1992 from the current 10 percent, to encourage manufacturers to make products that last longer and to encourage reductions in packaging, which constitutes 30 percent of residential solid waste. These goals were quickly endorsed by some members of Congress, and pending bills would give the agency authority to regulate materials in products and packages.</p>
        <p>''The industries' response to our agenda hasn't been overwhelming,'' said Bruce R. Weddle, director of the agency's solid-waste programs. ''But it's not all the companies' fault. It's going to take a number of years for people to become aware of their responsibilities for waste management and to insist on buying products that are recyclable. It's a little foolish to think that industries will market products if people won't buy them.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the McDonald's Corporation has started some pilot programs to blunt the drive by some localities and states to ban the plastic foam packaging its restaurants use for hamburgers and drinks. In the pilot programs consumers are asked to separate their waste food from the plastic packaging, which is then shipped to a recycler. Such programs are rare because the shipping costs outweigh the value of the used plastic.</p>
        <p>Procter &amp; Gamble, the maker of Pampers disposable diapers, has been trying to repulse the attack on such diapers by taking a highly visible role in recycling. In April, for example, the company announced that containers for a number of its products would be made of 20 percent to 100 percent recycled plastic. Recently it announced a pilot program to try to recycle disposable diapers.  Environmentalists Are Wary</p>
        <p>Companies are also testing the marketing opportunity they see in green products, but some environmental groups are wary. ''I think it's important for the public to see this trend for what it is,'' said Peter Bahouth, the executive director of Greenpeace, an environmental group in Washington. ''A lot of it is just a marketing sham.''</p>
        <p>Products promoted as kind to the environment are introduced at a rate 30 times as fast as other packaged goods, said Richard Lawrence, president of Marketing Intelligence Service Ltd., a company in Naples, N.Y., that tracks new products. He said the number of new products introduced each year in supermarkets and drugstores has hovered around 5,000 for several years, while the number of new green products rose to 178 last year from 55 in 1984.</p>
        <p>Some experts on solid waste foresee a day when consumer products will carry disposal information much as they now carry nutritional information. ''The mere thought of disposal labels causes manufacturers to pale,'' said Dana Duxury, a recycling consultant in Andover, Mass. ''But the competition would force companies to make their products safer for the environment.''  CONSUMER'S WORLD</p>
