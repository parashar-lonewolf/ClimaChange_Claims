        <p>NEWARK, Jan. 24 Â— Federal environmental officials have reached a settlement with New Jersey's largest utility to reduce pollution from two power plants that the government said had failed to control emissions under clean air laws.</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Federal environmental officials have reached a settlement with New Jersey's largest utility to reduce pollution from two power plants that the government said had failed to control emissions under clean air laws.</p>
        <p>Under the terms of the agreement, PSEG Fossil, a subsidiary of the utility, has agreed to spend about $337 million during the next decade to reduce emissions from its coal-powered electricity generating plants in Jersey City in Hudson County and in Hamilton Township in Mercer County.</p>
        <p>The settlement with PSEG Fossil, a unit of Public Service Enterprise Group in Newark, was announced little more than a week after John Ashcroft, the United States attorney general, promised to pursue a series of lawsuits, including the New Jersey case, filed by the Clinton administration to promote stricter enforcement of clean air laws.</p>
        <p>The lawsuits, filed against 51 owners of coal-fired power plants and oil refineries, most of them in the Midwest, accused the operators of failing to install proper pollution controls during renovations, a violation of provisions of the Clean Air Act.</p>
        <p>The PSEG Fossil settlement, filed today in Federal District Court here, requires the company to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions from the two plants by 36,000 tons each year. Nitrogen oxide emissions must be cut by 18,000 tons annually.</p>
        <p>The agreement, which depends on approval by a federal judge, calls for the use of air scrubbers to remove the sulfur dioxide and catalytic converters to reduce nitrogen oxide.</p>
        <p>Besides the more than $337 million that the company estimates is needed to reduce emissions, PSEG Fossil also agreed to pay a $1.4 million fine and spend an additional $6 million for other pollution-control projects, including the reduction of carbon dioxide and mercury emissions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ashcroft praised the agreement in a statement. ''This important settlement reflects our continuing commitment to enforce vigorously the Clean Air Act to protect public health and the environment.''</p>
        <p>Christie Whitman, the administrator of the federal Environmental Protection Agency and former New Jersey governor, said: ''This agreement is an excellent example of how effective federal and state partnerships in enforcement actions can greatly benefit the environment and assure public health protection. Today's agreement will improve the air quality for those who live around the Mercer and Hudson plants.''</p>
        <p>Environmental advocates said they hoped the settlement would prompt other utility companies to follow suit.</p>
        <p>The company ''has really taken a leadership role here,'' said Bill Wolfe, a spokesman for the New Jersey chapter of the Sierra Club. ''Hopefully this can persuade others to follow or show that it's economically viable to have clean air and water and still have adequate power supplies.''</p>
        <p>Scott Segal, a lawyer representing the power companies that are facing pending lawsuits, said the settlement should not necessarily be viewed as a harbinger of similar agreements.</p>
        <p>''What's good for PSE&amp;G may not be good for everyone else,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But Neil Brown, a spokesman for PSEG Power, a subsidiary of Public Service Enterprise that includes PSEG Fossil, said that he hoped others in the industry might be moved to act as his company had and that the cost of carrying out the changes should not deter them from doing so.</p>
        <p>''We think that we can do this and continue to provide an adequate and affordable electrical supply,'' he said.</p>
