        <p>But She Can Still Sing</p>
        <p>When people in show business say, ''Break a leg,'' the command is not supposed to be taken literally. But maybe it's best not to discuss that today with the Canadian soprano Adrienne Pieczonka, right, acclaimed for her Sieglinde in ''Die Walk端re'' in the new Canadian Opera Company production of Wagner's ''Ring'' in Toronto. Over the weekend she broke her ankle. When ''Die Walk端re'' is performed tonight Ms. Pieczonka, with her ankle in a cast, will still be onstage and singing, but stationary. The soprano Irmgard Vilsmaier will act the role of Sieglinde.</p>
        <p>Archaeologists Approve Acropolis Filming</p>
        <p>Nia Vardalos, below, the writer and star of the hit 2002 film ''My Big Fat Greek Wedding,'' has accomplished a rare feat. She has been granted permission by the Central Council of Archaeology in Greece to film a new comedy on the Acropolis in Athens and at other historic sites, including Delphi, Olympia, Thermopyles and Epidaurus, Agence France-Presse reported, citing the producer, Mark Hufam. The film, ''My Life in Ruins,'' scheduled to go before the cameras late next month, tells of a group of tourists introduced to ancient Greece by a Greek-American guide, played by Ms. Vardalos. Agence France-Presse reported that the last filmmaker to be granted access to the Acropolis was Francis Ford Coppola, for a segment of the 1989 film ''New York Stories.''</p>
        <p>Saving Aboriginal Art</p>
        <p>The National Trust of Australia has issued an urgent call for protection of ancient rock art regarded as an Aboriginal Bible, CBC Arts reported. The National Trust, an independent agency that safeguards such sites, appealed in a report last week for a moratorium on industrial development and a heritage listing for the art, situated in the rugged Dampier Archipelago, an island chain off northwest Australia. The report said the petroglyphs are menaced by acid rain from petrochemical plants in the area and by development projects that involve blasting. The million carvings, said to be the largest such collection in the world, are 6,000 to 30,000 years old and chronicle ancient Aboriginal societies.</p>
        <p>Footnotes</p>
        <p>Usher, right, has extended his run as the lawyer Billy Flynn in the musical ''Chicago'' for two weeks, through Oct. 14, at the Ambassador Theater. The Irish Repertory Theater in Chelsea will open its 19th season with the 1922 Eugene O'Neill play ''The Hairy Ape.'' The story of a brutish stoker aboard an ocean liner and his encounter with the beautiful, spoiled daughter of the shipowner will begin previews on Sept. 29, open officially on Oct. 5 and continue through Nov. 19.</p>
