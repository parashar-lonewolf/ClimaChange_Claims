        <p>LEAD: To the Editor:</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I commend your recognition of the importance of appliance energy efficiency standards and your support of such standards nationwide (''California Fridge, New York Toaster,'' editorial, Dec. 1). Although as Assembly Energy Committee chairman I am the sponsor of a bill in the New York State Legislature to strengthen efficiency standards in this state, I have long preferred minimum efficiency standards on the national level. The Assembly passed my bill last year after six years of waiting for Federal standards proved fruitless. Now it appears we must wait longer.</p>
        <p>President Reagan's veto of the national efficiency standards bill was a great surprise. Although he has avoided creating such standards, the President is now under court order to do so by 1988. His rationale for the veto is that he believes standards would intrude on the free market and on traditional state responsibilities.</p>
        <p>What the President has ignored is the fact that the industry, along with environmental and ratepayer groups, asked for national standards because they recognized the trend toward individual state standards was clearly more disruptive to the market.</p>
        <p>Although I, too, favor national standards, I am compelled by the significant dollar and energy savings resulting from energy efficiency requirements to reintroduce my bill and push for Senate passage. Appliance efficiency standards would save New Yorkers $4 billion in utility bills and avoid the need to construct at least one multibillion-dollar power plant. Conservation is the cheapest and most environmentally desirable method of meeting energy-usage needs. There is no nuclear waste, acid rain or inefficient energy usage and the standards can be achieved cheaply, often with paybacks of less than one year.</p>
        <p>We in New York can no longer afford to wait for action from the Reagan Administration. We must protect ourselves from high energy costs.</p>
        <p>WILLIAM B. HOYT</p>
        <p>Member of Assembly, 144th Dist.</p>
        <p>Albany, Dec. 17, 1986</p>
