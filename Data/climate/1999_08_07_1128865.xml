        <p>A preliminary report on a nuclear waste storage project in Nevada concludes that very little radiation would leak from the site and that a repository there would be as safe as and much cheaper than securing the waste where it now collects, at dozens of sites around the nation.</p>
        <p>The preliminary environmental impact statement, released today by the Department of Energy, acknowledges, though, that some major issues are not understood well enough to recommend using the desert site, Yucca Mountain, which is about 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas.</p>
        <p>The flow of water in the area is a major uncertainty. Opponents say assumptions in the report used by the department about water flow in area are contradicted by other evidence the department has gathered.</p>
        <p>A department official deeply involved in the Yucca Mountain project acknowledged that ''we have a lot of work to do'' before a recommendation is made to the Energy Secretary to proceed with construction. But, he said, ''We probably know more about Yucca than any other piece of property on the earth.''</p>
        <p>The report is a milestone in the department's plan to build the repository. Another milestone is likely early next week, when the Environmental Protection Agency plans to issue a draft of the rules that a repository would have to meet to be licensed for operation. The agency will call for the repository to hold the bulk of the radiation for 10,000 years, but people familiar with the draft said the agency had not decided how many miles the radiation should be allowed to spread in that period.</p>
        <p>The entire proposed site, which is 230 square miles, is controlled by the Energy Department, the Air Force or the Bureau of Land Management. But water flowing underground would eventually carry radioactive materials beyond the site's borders.</p>
        <p>The environmental impact statement for the first time evaluates the safety of leaving the waste where it is, at 72 commercial reactor sites and 5 Energy Department sites, and finds little safety difference, if storage canisters at the existing sites can be replaced every century or so. But it finds that leaving the waste there would be much more expensive in the long run than storage at Yucca Mountain.</p>
        <p>The report says leaving the waste where it is would cost hundreds of millions of dollars a year for thousands of years, while the repository would cost tens of billions of dollars.</p>
        <p>The statement is another step in the department's case to move ahead with a project that critics say is doomed to fail because engineers and scientists cannot say what will happen in coming millennia, when gradual climate change could make Nevada a wet area, which could rust the containers and spread the waste.</p>
        <p>The biggest question is how much radioactive material would gradually escape from the waste and be washed by rain into underground water supplies. The statement says hardly any would escape. It relies on Energy Department theories that the seepage of rainwater from the top of the mountain, down 660 to 1,400 feet to where the waste would be buried, and then another 600 to 1,200 feet to where underground water flows, called the saturated zone, would be very slow. The department believes radioactive material would move only slowly with the flow of water deep underground. But outside scientists dispute those theories.</p>
        <p>In addition, rock at the site includes crystals that some scientists say are evidence of intermittent upwellings of underground water, which would speed the spread of radioactive materials. The department is seeking to demonstrate that these crystals were formed in the same volcanic process that made the mountain, and that the water table is stable at a level hundreds of feet below where the waste would go.</p>
        <p>The official involved in preparing the report said the saturated zone and seepage needed to be studied further before a recommendation to build the repository could be made. Building would ultimately be subject to approval by Congress.</p>
        <p>The State of Nevada opposes the project. At its Nuclear Waste Project Office, Steven A. Frishman, the technical policy coordinator, said that another important assumption behind the environmental impact statement was how long the steel canisters holding the waste would remain intact.</p>
        <p>The Energy Department analysis assumes that of the thousands of canisters that would hold the waste, only one would fail while it was still ''juvenile,'' or less than 1,000 years old. Opponents note that canisters now used to store fuel at reactors have already had problems.</p>
        <p>The 1,600-page study is unusual because it lists only two alternatives: building Yucca or doing nothing. Most environmental impact statements weigh a variety of options, but department officials said the Nuclear Waste Policy Act did not provide for any others.</p>
