        <p>The European Community today became the first industrialized region to propose a clean-energy tax in an attempt to curb worldwide emissions of carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>The European Commission, the community's executive body, asked its 12 member nations to begin debate on proposals that would put a surcharge of $10 a barrel on oil by the end of the century, and surcharges of $14 for equivalent amounts of coal and $5 for nuclear power.</p>
        <p>The purpose of the package of proposals is to cut power consumption generally and, in particular, to discourage the use of those sources that produce the most carbon dioxide. The plan represents an effort to meet the community's proclaimed target of stabilizing carbon dioxide emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000.</p>
        <p>Carbon dioxide, largely produced by the burning of fossil fuels like oil or coal, is the major contributor to the greenhouse effect, in which many scientists say the temperature of the earth will gradually rise, thus raising the sea level, changing rainfall patterns and displacing flora and fauna.</p>
        <p>Carlo Ripa Di Meana, the European commissioner in charge of environmental matters, said the community would ask the other major industrial powers, the United States and Japan, to adopt similar strategies. Japan has expressed willingness to curb fossil fuels while both the Reagan and Bush Administrations have resisted calls for an energy tax. "We will redouble our efforts to convince the Americans to change their minds," Mr. Ripa Di Meana said.</p>
        <p>Today's proposals were offered by the commission to the member nations for debate, and fell short of proposed legislation that would be binding on the 12 members -- Belgium, Britain, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain.  Industries Against Tax</p>
        <p>The tax proposal has already drawn the wrath of most of the major European industrial lobbying groups.</p>
        <p>Germany, the most powerful European country and the most avid for ecological legislation, has indicated support for the proposals while others, including Britain, Greece and Portugal, have expressed reservations.</p>
        <p>"Any hasty forecast would be dangerous from my point of view," Mr. Ripa Di Meana said when asked to assess the chances for ultimate passage. The member nations are to begin their debate on Dec. 10.</p>
        <p>The greatest fear in countries subject to the community proposals is that industries will move to untaxed countries to keep their costs down. Part of the European Commission's strategy is to shelter basic industries like steel, chemicals, nonferrous metals, cement, glass and pulp and paper from the initial effects of the tax. Those industries would be encouraged to make voluntary cutbacks to curb unnecessary use of energy and to develop alternative energy sources that do not produce as much carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>In the commission's proposals, the energy tax would be graduated, beginning, for example, at $3 for a barrel of oil in 1993 and adding $1 a barrel each year through 2000, for a total of $10 that year. It would be collected by individual governments and could be used by them for any purpose. The proposals express the hope that some of the money would go into using alternative sources of energy, including the sun, wind or small dams, as well as into such measures as lower speed limits on the highways and better insulation in homes.</p>
        <p>The burden of the surcharge, as proposed, would fall most heavily on individual consumers, particularly for cars and home heating, as companies would pass on the expense of the tax. Mr. Ripa Di Meana said gasoline prices would increase 3.2 percent by 1995, and 5.9 percent by 2000. The equivalent increases for diesel fuel would be 5.3 percent in 1995 and 9.6 percent in 2000. For heating, light oil would become 16.8 percent more costly by 2000; natural gas, 11.9 percent more costly, and electricity, 14.3 percent higher.</p>
        <p>For industrial uses, the cost of coal would rise 30.3 percent by 1995 with the proposed tax, and 60.6 percent by 2000. Oil would be 23.6 percent higher in 1995, and up 39.6 percent in 2000; natural gas would increase 18.9 percent in 1995 and 31 percent in 2000, and electricity would be up 8.1 percent in 1995 and 16.3 by 2000.</p>
        <p>The commission had ordered a score of studies about the effects of the proposed tax before proposing it. Mr. Ripa Di Meana said the package of proposals could at most reduce the yearly growth rate of the community by 0.1 percent and by as little as 0.05 percent. By concentrating on energy sources, the tax would not penalize the least-developed members of the community. According to one estimate, Portugal emits about 2 metric tons of carbon dioxide per person a year, while the comparable figure for Denmark or Germany would be 14 metric tons.</p>
        <p>According to the commission's figures, the United States produces about 23 percent of the world's carbon dioxide emissions, Japan 5 percent, the European Community 13 percent and Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union 25 percent. Mr. Ripa Di Meana acknowledged that the United States Government still took a hard line against energy taxes."The Americans have a culture which is very extravagant in the use of energy -- for example in big cars -- which has developed over a long period of time," he said.</p>
        <p>The commissioner noted that when OPEC forced up the price of oil in the 1970's by curbing production, energy consumption in the developed world went down. Now, he said, OPEC was protesting the idea of an energy tax that would raise oil prices.</p>
        <p>"Someone said today that our tax is the same as theirs, but we hope that OPEC will take that only as a witty remark," the commissioner said.</p>
