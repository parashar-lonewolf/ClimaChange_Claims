        <p>More than a decade after Congressional passage of a plan to reduce America's dependence on imported oil, the Senate is set to debate another energy proposal with familiar provisions.</p>
        <p>At its core, the measure, which is closely modeled after a plan offered earlier this year by the White House, seeks to end the nation's economic vulnerability by clearing the way for the oil industry to drill in sensitive areas like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska and by making it easier for the nuclear industry to build new reactors.</p>
        <p>To help make such steps politically palatable, the bill includes conservation measures aimed at making appliances and buildings more efficient and requiring some fleets of vehicles to use fuels other than gasoline. Threat of Filibuster</p>
        <p>But the energy bill faces a very difficult path. Democratic leaders and some Republicans said from the start that they would not sponsor the President's energy package; several Democrats said earlier this month that they would stage a filibuster when the version completed by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee reaches the Senate floor, which could be as early as Thursday.</p>
        <p>The dispute that has attracted the most attention is drilling in the Arctic refuge, one of the nation's last wilderness regions. National environmental organizations have staked their reputations and political influence in Congress on blocking any exploration there, saying industrialization would harm a landscape that is almost untouched.</p>
        <p>The White House, meanwhile, has been directing a public relations campaign. The Energy and Interior Secretaries urged the bill's passage during news conferences; a White House ceremony was held last week and other public gatherings are scheduled this week.</p>
        <p>"There is no silver bullet to solving our energy problems," Senator Macolm Wallop, Republican of Wyoming who co-sponsored the energy bill, said at a news conference on Tuesday. "It is inconceivable to me that America will benefit by paying more money into foreign coffers for oil.</p>
        <p>Senator Wallop added, "You cannot imagine an energy bill that does not call for some new energy production." Bipartisan Opposition</p>
        <p>Still, several Republicans are not in line. One, Senator William V. Roth Jr. of Delaware, sponsored the 1980 legislation that established the 19-million-acre Arctic refuge. Members of Senator Roth's staff said he opposes any industrial intrusion in the region.</p>
        <p>Senator Frank H. Murkowski, Republican of Alaska and an avid supporter of the bill, argues that environmentalists are being "dishonest" in their arguments about the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. He argues that only 10,000 to 15,000 acres of the refuge would be affected by the drilling. Improved drilling techniques and new environmental technologies will make exploring for oil in the refuge at least as safe as the industrialization of nearby Prudhoe Bay, where wildlife has been unaffected and the fragile tundra largely unharmed, he said. The risks of environmental damage, he added, are far outweighed by the benefits of gaining oil reserves estimated as high as nine billion barrels.</p>
        <p>"Environmentalists are using this issue to build their memberships, using hyperbole to cause fear without any real costs to them," Senator Murkowski said in an interview. "It's a win-win situation for them. Even if the refuge is opened, they can say they were rolled by big oil." An Elemental Debate</p>
        <p>But for national environmental groups and their supporters in the Senate the issue is how far Americans are willing to go to gain the oil. They oppose opening the Arctic refuge to exploration and putting a wild ecosystem in danger of permanent harm to sustain a petroleum-based economy that they view as wasteful and polluting.</p>
        <p>Just as in the 1970's, when Congress responded to the Arab oil embargo with a succession of laws to eliminate price controls on petroleum products, establish mandatory fuel-efficiency standards for cars and invest billions of dollars in the development of alternative energy sources, the debate this year essentially involves two competing views of American life.</p>
        <p>What is missing, though, say leaders on both sides, is any sense of urgency about the problem. Gasoline prices are stable and low. Oil supplies are ample, and it appears they will be for the foreseeable future, according to energy industry analysts. Thus, while the nation's vulnerability to supply cuts remains unchanged, the public's attention span on the issue is short.</p>
        <p>The sponsors of the Senate energy package, including its author, Senator J. Bennett Johnston, Democrat of Louisiana, are promoting a plan that asks for virtually no change on the part of the American consumer. Senator Johnston and his supporters contend that increasing supplies and some conservation measures are enough to keep energy prices moderate and supplies adequate.</p>
        <p>At a news conference on Tuesday, Senator Johnston acknowledged that his bill would not substantially reduce the nation's reliance on imported oil, which accounts for roughly half of the domestic supply. But, he added,, a new study by the Technology Assessment Office, a Congressional research arm, showed that passage of the bill was the only way to keep the reliance on imported oil from getting worse and the only way to keep the nation's economy growing. More than 60 percent of imported oil is used for transportation, mostly in cars and light trucks. Disagreement Among Opponents</p>
        <p>Opponents of the measure differ strongly on what is needed and have a far more optimistic opinion about the number of changes most Americans are willing to make to gain independence from foreign oil. Citing data from surveys and the Energy Department's own internal memorandums on the issue, opponents of the bill say Americans are eager to accept more efficient cars, more efficient buildings and to pay for more research and development on renewable energy supplies.</p>
        <p>The Johnston bill, opponents say, achieves none of these objectives, but will fill the coffers of oil companies while ruining the nation's second-largest wildlife refuge, reward inefficiencies in the nuclear industry, drain the Treasury of billions of dollars and do nothing to change the basic structure of the transportation industry.</p>
        <p>"It is a comprehensive energy bill," Senator Paul Wellstone, a Democrat of Minnesota, said on Tuesday. "There's something in it for every oil company."</p>
