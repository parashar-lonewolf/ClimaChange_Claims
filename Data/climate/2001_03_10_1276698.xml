        <p>It's not easy being green. Or so BP Amoco P.L.C. is discovering.</p>
        <p>Over the last few years, BP Amoco broke with many competitors and positioned itself as a leader on environmental issues. It stressed efforts to build solar-power equipment, cut its own carbon dioxide emissions and, most significantly, shift its mammoth business toward production of cleaner-burning natural gas and away from oil. Last summer, it unveiled a new look: a sunburst and the slogan ''Beyond Petroleum.''</p>
        <p>Now, a group of American and British investors, seeking proof that BP Amoco is indeed beyond petroleum, hopes to introduce a shareholder resolution at the company's annual meeting on April 19 asking BP to reconsider drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge of Alaska. This, at a time the Bush administration has made drilling in the refuge a centerpiece of its energy policy.</p>
        <p>BP Amoco rebuffed a similar move a week ago, arguing that foreign investors who hold their stock in the form of depository receipts could not initiate shareholder resolutions. Though the company has yet to declare its position on this new appeal, investors expect resistance. And BP has drawn charges it is flouting shareholder rights, which it denies.</p>
        <p>But the dispute may signal that as the Bush administration seeks to open new drilling opportunities for oil companies, BP Amoco is edging away from a Beyond Petroleum campaign that seems to have become more of an Achilles' heel than a business advantage. ''BP wanted to win public support, so they adopted a very green look to the business'' said Tony Alves, an analyst with Investec Henderson Crosthwaite in London. ''But it probably went too far.''</p>
        <p>For years, environmentalists have tried to persuade BP Amoco to refrain from drilling on the coastal plain of the Arctic refuge, a birthing ground for 150,000 caribou and many species of birds. But BP is the dominant oil company on the North Slope of Alaska. Renouncing production in the Arctic wilderness could damage its share price and put BP Amoco at odds with Alaska politicians who favor drilling -- people it depends upon for permits and good will.</p>
        <p>''The political moment is right for BP as far as drilling in the refuge,'' said Francis Grant-Suttie, director of private sector initiatives at the World Wildlife Fund, a co-sponsor of the shareholder resolution. ''The White House plan, the Senate energy bill -- all the political alignments are coming to play here.''</p>
        <p>BP has said that if drilling goes ahead, it will compete for projects in the Arctic refuge. ''Many people have misinterpreted Beyond Petroleum,'' a company spokesman, Roddy Kennedy, said, adding that BP had wanted to convey that its purchases of Amoco and ARCO increased its production of natural gas.</p>
        <p>Confusion about Beyond Petroleum is not without cause. BP's literature and advertising promote its greenness. One brochure reads: ''Each of us has a role to play in our drive to create a company renowned for performance, environmental leadership, innovation and progressive ideas. We are the new BP.''</p>
        <p>Life might have been simpler had the company remained the old BP. Environmentalists and activist shareholders acknowledge that they push harder with relatively eco-friendly corporations like BP Amoco, where they see a chance of influencing opinions. Last April, investors introduced a resolution requiring BP Amoco to stay out of the Arctic refuge. Such resolutions usually collect about 4 percent of votes. At BP Amoco, 13 percent voted for the proposition, rattling management and emboldening activists.</p>
        <p>BP maintained that last year it treated the investor resolution ''informally.'' But this year, it refused to include the Arctic resolution in its annual meeting agenda. Because a third of BP is held by foreign shareholders, its stance has alarmed securities industry experts and a wider range of investors than might support the Arctic resolution.</p>
        <p>''All shareholders should be treated equally,'' said Julian Franks, a professor of finance at the London Business School. ''A.D.R. shareholders should not be limited in their rights because of the form in which their shares are held.''</p>
        <p>The company required holders of depository receipts to find at least 100 owners of common stock to support the resolutions in order for the propositions to be included on the agenda. There are now 129 shareholders sponsoring the resolution, said Athan Manuel, director of the Arctic Wilderness Campaign at the U.S. Public Interest Research Group. But BP is expected to contest many of these shareholders' participation.</p>
        <p>The reluctance of BP Amoco to entertain the Arctic resolution may stem from a fight within the company to determine just what Beyond Petroleum means. ''There's an internal debate between some really smart environmental people who are pushing the envelope,'' said Mr. Grant-Suttie, who regularly meets with BP officials. ''And then there's the directors of BP business units, who are competing with the Exxon Mobils everywhere for fields, capital, shareholder interest, and they're coming back and saying, 'This Beyond Petroleum stuff is putting us at a disadvantage.'
