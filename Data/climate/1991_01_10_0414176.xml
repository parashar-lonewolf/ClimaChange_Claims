        <p>THE last time Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd. had a foreign order for a nuclear reactor was in 1981, when Romania promised payment in everything from strawberries to underwear. Although Romania eventually paid what it promised, it ran out of money and left the plant half-finished.</p>
        <p>Stories of unfinished projects have become typical in the hard times that have hit the nuclear reactor industry in the last 15 years. But a recent order from Korea has revived hopes at Atomic Energy that its business has not fully disappeared.</p>
        <p>Very few countries have broken ground on new plants recently, and export orders have been rarer still. Atomic Energy's last order before Romania's was from Ontario Hydro in the mid-1970's. That is about the same time that American manufacturers saw their last domestic orders (not counting orders for more than 100 reactors canceled before completion).</p>
        <p>American companies have had somewhat better success in the world market. In 1987, the Tokyo Electric Power Company agreed to buy two advanced models from the General Electric Company; Combustion Engineering Inc., now a subsidiary of Asea Brown Boveri A.B., sold two to South Korea, and the Westinghouse Electric Corporation won an order from Britain's Central Electricity Generating Board.</p>
        <p>Japan, South Korea and Indonesia are the current export targets of reactor makers. Atomic Energy of Canada also thinks an order may come from the Netherlands.</p>
        <p>Canada has found exports harder in part because of the unique type of commercial reactor it builds. But while its Candu system -- so named because it uses deuterium in the reactor process -- is often a hard sell because of its uniqueness, it has advantages in sustaining nuclear fission.</p>
        <p>American reactors use uranium that has been painstakingly enriched, carrying three times as much fissionable material as is found in nature. The Candu runs on natural uranium, which attracted the Romanians, who would have had to send their uranium to the Soviet Union for enrichment.</p>
        <p>The Korea Electric Power Corporation, the Government-owned national utility that gave Atomic Energy of Canada an order recently, was attracted to the Canadian design by this and two other features: The Candu can be made to run on leftover uranium from some of Korea's existing plants. And the Candu can operate nearly continuously, because it can be refueled while running.</p>
        <p>Electricity demand is rising in South Korea bynearly 15 percent a year, which implies a doubling in five years. "They have no coal, no oil, no gas and no hydro," said Dr. Stanley R. Hatcher, president and chief executive of Atomic Energy of Canada. "Nuclear is sure to be a big part."</p>
        <p>The South Korean company already has a Candu, Wolsong 1, built in 1983. It began operating only 61 months after construction started, half what reactors in the United States take to build, and in 1986, it held the world record for reliability.</p>
        <p>Wolsong 2, as the new 700-megawatt reactor will be designated, is to be completed by 1997. The price is $600 million (Canadian), of which one-third will go to South Korean subcontractors and the rest to Canadian companies.</p>
        <p>The order may be even more important to the Canadians than the Koreans. Aside from providing $400 million (Canadian) in hardware and service contracts -- signed in Seoul last month -- the project will keep skills alive, Dr. Hatcher said.</p>
        <p>"This Korean sale is an important element of keeping the industry viable, and keeping the work in the shops," he said. The sale means 2,000 jobs for four years and another 5,000 created indirectly.</p>
        <p>But surviving another nine years without an order "would be hard," Dr. Hatcher acknowledged. The plan of Atomic Energy of Canada and others is to hold on long enough for a turnaround in the business. It is hoped that electrification of growing economies like South Korea's, combined with fear of global warming induced by burning coal or other fuels, will spur new reactor orders.</p>
        <p>Ontario Hydro's plans for 10 new reactors is in doubt because of a change of the provincial government last year. But Atomic Energy has a nearby market in mind: It is discussing with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission how to license a small Candu reactor in the United States. Dr. Hatcher said he expected the United States to have a nuclear revival, adding, "We hope to be there."  TALKING DEALS</p>
