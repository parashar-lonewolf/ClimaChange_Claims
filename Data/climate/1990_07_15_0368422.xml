        <p>When the leaders of the Group of Seven industrialized nations met last week in Houston, the three main issues of contention were trade policy, aid to the Soviet Union and the environment. Here, by David E. Rosenbaum, a New York Times correspondent who covered the Houston event, is a look at the issues, what the summit meeting produced and the outlook.</p>
        <p>Trade</p>
        <p>The issue: International trade liberalization talks are deadlocked over farm subsidies. The summit partners all subsidize their farmers, resulting in severely distorted world prices. Government support in Europe and Japan, however, is much more extensive than it is in the United States. President Bush asserts that unless the supports are reduced, developing nations with little to sell but their farm products will walk out of the trade talks. But the Europeans are especially reluctant to act.</p>
        <p>The summit decision: The final communique included ambiguous language that allowed all sides to claim victory. For the United States, it pledged specific attention to reduction of export supports. For the Europeans, it recognized that ''social and economic conditions'' must be reflected in farm policy. For the Japanese, it implicitly recognized that their prohibition of rice imports is considered a matter of national security. But more important than the words, the summit may have provided the political impetus to get the trade negotiators talking again.</p>
        <p>The next step: When trade negotiators resume, some agreement will probably be reached on lowering farm subsidies. But it is too early to tell whether it will satisfy the developing countries.</p>
        <p>Soviet Aid</p>
        <p>The issue: Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany has pledged more than $3 billion in credits to the Soviet Union and with the support of President Francois Mitterrand of France is pushing for a $15 billion aid package from the industrial countries. The United States and others oppose direct aid but are prepared to offer technical assistance. They maintain that the money will be wasted in the absence of a free-market economy. Furthermore, Mr. Bush argues that he cannot provide money to the Soviet Union so long as that country spends vast sums on its military and supports Cuba.</p>
        <p>The summit decision: The leaders encouraged the steps being taken toward a free-market economy, and agreed that individual countries were free to support the Soviets directly. They agreed to a study of Soviet economic needs by international organizations.</p>
        <p>The next step: After the meeting Mr. Bush said, ''I think Mr. Gorbachev understands that at this juncture, sending money from the United States is not in the cards.'' But Mr. Kohl, maintaining that the ''necessary steps'' are being taken, said, ''If this continues by the end of the year, we should be able to achieve a joint Western economic assistance program.''</p>
        <p>The Environment</p>
        <p>The issue: Chancellor Kohl, with the support of the other leaders except for Mr. Bush, proposed a specific timetable for reducing emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases that some scientists believe contribute to global warming. Mr. Bush insisted that scientific data on climate change were inconclusive. He held that reduction of greenhouse gases could damage the economy in the United States and other countries and that action should not be taken without further evidence.</p>
        <p>The summit decision: Mr. Bush prevailed in that no timetable was set. But the communique declared that the countries were ''committed to undertake common efforts to limit emissions of greenhouse gases'' and that ''lack of full scientific certainty is no excuse to postpone actions which are justified in their own right.'' The leaders also agreed, with Mr. Bush's support, to develop a pilot program to help Brazil preserve its tropical rain forest.</p>
        <p>The next step: Mr. Bush is likely to face considerable pressure to relent on the global warming issue not only from his summit partners but also from environmental groups at home. International studies of the matter are under way, and more discussions will be held at a conference in Geneva in November.</p>
