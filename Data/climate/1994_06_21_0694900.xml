        <p>PLANT species living high in the Alps are climbing farther up their summits to escape the heat of a warming climate, but they risk going extinct when they run out of mountain, a study has found.</p>
        <p>While climate modelers and theoreticians have long predicted migrations of mountain plants upward into cooler zones, researchers say that this is the first comprehensive study to document such wholesale movement of plants.</p>
        <p>Surveying 26 summits, Austrian researchers reported species migrating skyward at a rate of about 3 feet a decade in this century, with some moving as fast as 12 feet a decade. At the same time, the mean annual temperature increased less than 1 1/2 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
        <p>"This is an important paper," said Dr. Walter Oechel, director of the Global Change Research Group at San Diego State University. "The message is that even fairly small increases in temperature appear to be having fairly significant impacts on species' distribution and richness."</p>
        <p>Researchers cautioned, however, that while warming appears to be the cause of the plants' movement, the cause of the warming, whether man-made or natural, is a separate question. Regardless of the cause of the warming, the new study "helps us understand the rate of migration of species and changes in species compositions with warming, which helps us make predictions," Dr. Oechel said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Skip Walker, a plant ecologist at the Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research at the University of Colorado in Boulder, said the study was "the first real evidence that this kind of movement may occur," adding, "People have been suspecting it's been happening without being able to show it." Probable Worldwide Effect</p>
        <p>Dr. Dwight Billings, an arctic and Alpine ecologist at Duke University in Durham, N.C., said: "There certainly is upward migration. Things are happening. And I'm sure if they're happening over there due to global warming, they're certainly happening in New Zealand, in the Alaskan mountains, in the Sierra Nevada."</p>
        <p>Dr. Oechel agreed, saying, "This is one study in one area and the effects appear to be profound, but similar things are undoubtedly happening in many other areas, so the impacts are likely much larger than the ones reported here."</p>
        <p>In fact, the newest study, published in the journal Nature this month, is part of a growing body of evidence that species' distributions are moving toward colder climes.</p>
        <p>The difficulty with many of the recent anecdotal observations as well as the larger studies is that distributions of plants, and especially animals, can be hard to map. Pinpointing the edges of a particular species' range can be logistically difficult. In addition, the distributions of many species can be quite fluid and easily altered by a number of forces, including climate.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, Alpine plants pushing the upper limits of survival on a mountaintop have much more clearly delineated ranges. As a result, researchers welcomed the new study as a start to documenting discrete changes.</p>
        <p>"People are just beginning to try to quantify this in a serious way," said Dr. David Hopkins, a paleoecologist at the University of Alaska, whose observations have indicated a recent movement of trees in the Seward Peninsula of Alaska into regions that had been too cold for them.  Invasion of 'Lifeless Zones'</p>
        <p>Dr. Georg Grabherr, professor of vegetation ecology and conservation biology at the University of Vienna in Austria, and his colleagues were able to take advantage of a remarkable set of detailed historical floristic studies, some dating as far back as 90 years.</p>
        <p>The researchers gathered present-day data by doing plant inventories on the summits of 26 peaks exceeding 9,000 feet in the Austrian and Swiss Alps. They then compared their data to historical data on species distributions. The researchers found that in nearly all cases species at these high altitudes were appearing farther up the mountainsides than they had ever been seen before. The result is that these summits, typically places in which little or no life can survive, are becoming more and more crowded with plants.</p>
        <p>"It's the first time we have such evidence for an effect of warming at the limit of plant life," said Dr. Grabherr. "We are at the uppermost area where plants can be found. There's a point at which these lifeless zones are becoming invaded."</p>
        <p>At the same time, in Alpine meadows there are often snow beds, cool crevices tucked among a mountain's hollows and ridges. Dr. Grabherr said some of the migrating plants are finding temporary shelter from the heat by settling in snow beds.</p>
        <p>But as quickly as these plants can move, researchers say, it may not be fast enough to save themselves.</p>
        <p>Dr. Grabherr said that for every 100-yard increase in altitude up a mountain the temperature decreases by about 1 degree. Knowing that there had been an increase of from 1 to 1 1/2 degrees in mean annual temperature in these Alps over the last century, the researchers expected to see plants accommodate to the change by moving upward about 10 yards a decade. Most plants moved much slower, however, at a rate below one yard a decade.</p>
        <p>"The most important thing is that it shows that the rate of migration is lower than recent and anticipated warming," said Dr. Oechel, "and it implies that if there's a continual trend at a rate similar to this, species won't be able to keep up with their new thermal zones as they move higher and higher."</p>
        <p>Dr. Grabherr said he was surprised at the plants' inability to keep up with cooling, but he said that many things can affect their ability to migrate. Their seeds are dispersed largely by wind and sometimes by animals. As a result, the changing severity and intensity of wind and storms, as well as the changing habits and population sizes of animals all determine whether a plant will move an inch or a mile in a given season, regardless of temperature.</p>
        <p>But, researchers warn, even if plants do keep up, as long as warming continues they will eventually run out of places to go.</p>
        <p>In the Alps alone there are 40 to 50 plant species with very limited high mountain distributions, said Dr. Grabherr. "These plants are really endangered," he said. "They have no place they can escape." Dr. Grabherr said many researchers were predicting temperature increases of several degrees over the next 100 years, which he said would be likely to cause all these species to become extinct.</p>
        <p>In addition, researchers found that not all plants moved at the same rate. A small, yellow Alpine rose was the speediest, moving about 12 feet a decade, while most other herbs and grasses were moving less than 3 feet a decade. Little is known of the biology of these high-altitude species, and the basis for their differences in migration speed remains elusive.</p>
        <p>Researchers caution that while convincing, the new study does not prove that warming causes plant movement, although the two are suggestively correlated. Influence of Hikers</p>
        <p>"One needs to be cautious," said Dr. Lawrence Bliss, an arctic Alpine ecologist at the University of Washington in Seattle. "In terms of records, they have shown the plants have moved upslope, but the actual reasons for this are not fully substantiated."</p>
        <p>Although they cautioned that temperature rise and plant movement were merely correlated, researchers agreed that the most likely cause of the plants' movement up the Alps was indeed global warming.</p>
        <p>Other less likely causes that could account for, or at least contribute to, the plants' upward migration include increases in the number of people visiting in Alpine areas. For example, Dr. Billings said, at Glacier National Park in Montana researchers found that walking trails used by people have increased the movement of seeds upslope. But people are unlikely to have caused the plant movement on the particular peaks studied since they are fairly remote and difficult to climb. However, animal movement on those peaks could have influenced the plants' migrations.</p>
        <p>At the same time, Dr. Grabherr said, increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations could theoretically increase plant productivity at high altitudes, leading plants to spread upslope. However, both researchers said that other studies indicated that such causes were much less likely than increasing temperature to have effected the changes in the plants' ranges.</p>
