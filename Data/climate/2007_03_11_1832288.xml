        <p>ONE NOT-SO-SMALL STEP</p>
        <p>The News -- China announced that it would launch its first lunar probe this year and be able to put a man on the Moon within 15 years.</p>
        <p>Behind the News -- Nearly 10,000 scientists, engineers and technicians are involved in the country's lunar exploration effort. China said the orbital probe would pave the way to placing a remote-control rover on the Moon's surface as a prelude to a manned flight. ''Rockets are ladders to space,'' said one top Chinese space official. Chinese scientists hope to use the Moon as a ''relay station'' to voyage deeper into space.</p>
        <p>NO IDOL, BUT NO. 1</p>
        <p>The News -- ''Daughtry,'' the debut album of 27-year-old Chris Daughtry, a failed American Idol contestant, entered the week as the No. 1 rock album in the country.</p>
        <p>Behind the News -- A rocker with a shaved head, Daughtry finished fourth in a surprise on last season's show, voted off before an audience of more than 27 million as Paula Abdul struggled to keep her composure. But take heart, Paula. His album has sold 1.8 million copies in a sluggish market since its release 15 weeks ago, the fastest-selling rock debut album since Nielsen SoundScan first tracked music sales in 1991.</p>
        <p>CLEARING THE AIR</p>
        <p>The News -- The 27-nation European Union agreed to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 20 percent from 1990 levels in the next 13 years.</p>
        <p>Behind the News -- The union also committed itself to generating 20 percent of its power from renewable sources by 2020 and running 10 percent of its cars and trucks on biofuels. The deal was reached despite objections by least a dozen countries that the targets were unrealistic and too costly to achieve. Now comes the hard part as Europe gets down to the nitty-gritty of making those goals a reality.</p>
        <p>THE DANCE BEGINS</p>
        <p>The News -- Men's college basketball wraps up its week of division championships today and will learn tonight which 65 teams go to the Big Dance. The women's teams will be picked tomorrow.</p>
        <p>Behind the News -- Last week's tournaments began the annual mania known as March Madness. The winners get automatic bids to the single-elimination contest, in which powerhouses and Cinderellas battle to make the Sweet Sixteen, Elite Eight and Final Four. The survivors face each other for the N.C.A.A. championship.</p>
        <p>REAL MONEY</p>
        <p>The News -- The number of the world's billionaires rose to 946, according to Forbes magazine, which added 178 newcomers to its list of the world's richest people.</p>
        <p>Behind the News -- Forbes said strong equity markets and rising real estate and commodity prices helped push up the net worth of its billionaires by $900 billion to $3.5 trillion. Sixty percent made their money the old-fashioned way by earning it. Bill Gates is still on top, with $56 billion. The youngest? A 23-year-old German prince, Albert von Thurn und Taxis, above, worth $2 billion.</p>
