        <p>The Belgian health authorities ended a 10-day ban today on products of the Coca-Cola Company, permitting it to resume production in Belgium of sodas that were blamed for 249 cases of vomiting, cramps and other illnesses that shattered European confidence in the world's best-known brand.</p>
        <p>Coca-Cola welcomed the relaxation, promised a Coke giveaway here in coming days, offered to pay the medical costs of anyone who became ill and reiterated the company's contention that its sodas are safe. But in a continent riven by scares over the safety of supermarket products ranging from genetically modified soybeans to contaminated chicken, it remained doubtful that the heavyweight public relations campaign by the company and its chief executive, M. Douglas Ivester, had stilled Europe's mistrust. The Belgian authorities said they still had not determined the exact cause of the sickness that led to the biggest recall in Coca-Cola's 113-year history.</p>
        <p>Moreover, Coca-Cola's problems appeared to worsen in France. Belgian officials said a ban on imports of Coca-Cola products from a plant in Dunkirk, France, would be maintained until the French authorities had finished their inquiries into contamination there -- including unconfirmed reports that rat poison might have been the cause. Some 28,000 Coca-Cola product vending-machines in Belgium were also to remain out of action until checked for impurities.</p>
        <p>To end the ban, Coca-Cola agreed to five Belgian conditions relating to cleanliness and safety standards. Mr. Ivester said that production would resume immediately and that he expected Coca-Cola products to be back in Belgian stores within two weeks.</p>
        <p>But even as he announced plans to buy everyone in Belgium a Coke and was photographed drinking from a bottle of Coke at a news conference, questions persisted.</p>
        <p>Luc Van den Bossche, Belgium's Interior Minister, who is also in charge of public health, said at a news conference that Brussels did not accept the Atlanta-based company's explanations for what happened.</p>
        <p>Mr. Van den Bossche also suggested that some people might have been too quick to assume that Coca-Cola was the cause of their symptoms. He called it ''an unintentional overreaction on the part of the exposed persons.''</p>
        <p>Despite earlier indications that France might lift its ban today on Coca-Cola, Sprite and Fanta, the company's best sellers in both countries, French officials said the restrictions remained in force. The outcome of a separate inspection of Coca-Cola plants in Belgium by the European Union remained unclear, as did the future of restrictions on Coca-Cola products in Luxembourg and the Netherlands. Portugal, Italy, Spain and Germany are also conducting investigations into scares relating to Coke.</p>
        <p>In a further twist, Mr. Van den Bossche disclosed today that Belgium's investigation had been slowed by a previously secret inquiry into whether the contamination of Coca-Cola products in Belgium was linked to a murky extortion attempt last May in Germany.</p>
        <p>The purported blackmailer, the Belgian minister said, threatened to contaminate Coke if he was not paid ''several million marks.'' But inquiries established that ''there was no link between what happened in Germany and what happened here,'' Mr. Van den Bossche said at the news briefing, where he spoke from a table festooned with small bottles of Coke -- a statement of public confidence in public health marred only by his smoking of several cigarettes in front of the cameras.</p>
        <p>Mr. Van den Bossche took over the public health portfolio after the Belgian Government collapsed on June 13 in a scandal over the contamination of animal feeds by the cancer-causing chemical dioxin that led to the withdrawal of a wide array of poultry and meat.</p>
        <p>Coca-Cola's crisis began on June 7 when 30 schoolchildren reported illnesses linked to drinking Coke with what Mr. Ivester, in his first public appearance since the scare began, today called an ''off-taste and an off-smell.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Van den Bossche said that the symptoms of the illnesses included ''stomach ache, dizziness, cramps, vomiting, nausea and in some cases hyperventilation'' but that there was no clear pattern. Some who became ill reported having drunk from bottles of Coke and others from cans of Coke, sugar-free Coke and Fanta. The reports of illness were spread among the towns of Bornem, Bruges, Harelbeke and Lochristi.</p>
        <p>The Belgian official said the company had highlighted two problems -- contaminated carbon dioxide used at a bottling plant in Antwerp and the contamination of the outside of cans transported on wooden pallets. However, he said, there was no ''conclusive evidence'' of a link between those problems and the symptoms reported.</p>
        <p>''The most plausible hypothesis for explaining the problems that have arisen over the past few weeks is the occurrence of an accident during production or transport,'' Mr. Van den Bossche said. He also said there was only a ''remote chance that the root causes of these problems will ever occur again if the root causes of the incident are taken away.''</p>
        <p>He listed five conditions for the resumption of Coca Cola production: the use of fresh raw materials; thorough cleaning of plants and installations; enhanced safety measures; the introduction of a monitoring system for production, products and complaints, and the ''removal and disposal'' of products that may have been contaminated.</p>
        <p>Coca-Cola plants in Antwerp and Ghent ''may resume production of all Coca-Cola brands,'' he continued,  while imports from the plant in Dunkirk will remain banned pending French investigations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ivester, appearing at a separate news conference in Brussels, surrounded by security staff, translators and executives, reacted to criticism that Coca-Cola was slow in responding to the crisis. Asked if he would resign, he said he would not, and he said he had maintained an initial public silence at the request of the Belgian authorities.</p>
        <p>He immediately set about promoting the messages Coca-Cola will apparently use to restore confidence. ''Nothing is more important than protecting the public health,'' he said. ''Our products are completely safe, both in Belgium and worldwide.'' He dismissed reports of rat-poisoning in Dunkirk as a rumor and said, ''It is doubtful to me that that is an issue.''</p>
        <p>He declined to say how much the European crisis had cost but said the company had used an ''abundance of caution'' in responding to it.</p>
        <p>He also said customers would be invited to return Coca-Cola products to retailers for refunds. ''I think one of the first things I'll do is buy everyone in Belgium a Coke,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Those people who got sick will be able to apply to have medical expenses reimbursed, he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ivester also gave his first public explanation of the problem, saying that sulfur used in the production of carbon dioxide -- the source of the bubbles in sodas -- had not been cleansed as it should have been. He acknowledged that since the company supplying the carbon dioxide, Aga Gas of Sweden, had insisted that its supplies were uncontaminated, ''it could have been something in the handling'' that caused contamination. And he said wooden pallets had been contaminated with creosote, contrary to company rules forbidding its use.</p>
        <p>Several large Coca-Cola bottlers said today that the events in Europe had had no effect on their business in the United States.</p>
        <p>''I think generally people in the United States are not aware of it,'' said Cookie Rice, a bottler in Springfield, Mo.</p>
