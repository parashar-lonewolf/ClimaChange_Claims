        <p>1. Symptoms  The radio crackled to life with a burst of static. It was a Saturday night, and the emergency department was packed. An E.M.T.'s voice silenced the harsh electronic noise: ''We've got a 35-year-old Caucasian man with an altered state of consciousness. His friends think he might have been slipped some drugs.'' Minutes later, a young blond man was rolled into the E.R., screaming and shouting obscenities as he struggled against the straps that held him in place on the stretcher. ''I want to go,'' he yelled. ''I want to go.''</p>
        <p>The physician, a man in his 50's with gentle brown eyes and a neatly trimmed beard, approached the three men standing at the patient's bedside. ''I'm Dr. Shavelson. Can you tell me what happened?'' All three began speaking at once, then stopped. A young man began again: ''He was fine this morning. I had lunch with him. Then he went to the sauna. He called me a few hours later and said he felt like he'd been drugged.'' He told the friend that he was hot, nauseated and lightheaded; he was having a little trouble walking. By the time he got home, he felt worse, not better. So he called friends who lived nearby. He was having trouble seeing, he said, as if he were in a very narrow tunnel. His arms and hands felt strange and tingly. By the time his friends arrived, the young man was confused and disoriented. ''He looked at me, and I could tell he didn't know who I was,'' another of the young men reported. They all nodded. ''He's not like this,'' one of the friends said to the E.R. doctor. ''He's never like this.''</p>

''He's never like this.''</p>
        <p>He had no medical problems except that he had been in a bicycle accident some months earlier, which had left him with a broken elbow and a dented helmet. The patient didn't smoke, didn't drink; nor did he use illegal drugs -- at least as far as they knew. He was a slender man, fit and well kept. He wore jeans and a button-down shirt that was now damp with sweat and vomit. The physician smelled no alcohol on his breath, nor the fruity smell that would suggest he was a diabetic in need of insulin.</p>
        <p>2. Investigation  He didn't have a fever, and his blood pressure was normal. The meter on his finger showed that he was getting enough oxygen, although he was breathing deeply, as if catching his breath after a race. The rest of his physical exam was normal except that his fingers were bent, the muscles contracted as if he were gripping a ball.</p>
        <p>The most striking abnormality was the young man's confusion. He could not follow even simple commands. He couldn't tell the doctor his name or where he lived. When asked, he guessed the year was 1990.</p>
        <p>Dr. Lonny Shavelson, a physician with a couple of decades of experience in emergency departments, had frequently heard patients claim that they had been drugged, but he had found that this was rarely the case. Most drug use is voluntary. Still, the confusion and agitation were consistent with drug use. The doctor considered other less-common causes of confusion: an infection of the tough protective layer called the meninges or of the brain would cause confusion -- though usually there is fever or some other sign of illness.</p>
        <p>Could the patient have become dangerously overheated at the sauna? The temperature taken orally was normal, but oral thermometers can be unreliable. A rectal temperature would be required to rule that out. On the other hand, his friends made clear that this man's illness became worse after he left the sauna, so the story wasn't really right for hyperthermia. Dehydration was possible, but it usually causes dizziness, not confusion. The opposite also seemed possible: water intoxication. More commonly seen in endurance athletes, it occurs when the sweating runner drinks too much water. The effort to prevent dehydration backfires, and the normal body chemistry becomes diluted. It is unusual even in runners, but still possible.</p>
        <p>The physician turned his attention to another aspect of the patient's exam: he was hyperventilating. The young man was taking long deep breaths and had been since his arrival at the E.R. Many of his symptoms were typical of hyperventilation: the tunnel vision, the tingling hands and feet, the tense, curved fingers. The question was, Why was he hyperventilating? Could he have an injury affecting the breathing center of the brain? An injury that extensive would probably cause other neurologic effects, and none were apparent. You might also breathe this way if your blood became too acidic for any reason. Very deep breaths get rid of the carbon dioxide stored in your lungs and rapidly reduce the acidity of your blood. For example, this could happen to a diabetic in need of insulin. An overdose of aspirin can cause hyperventilation, confusion, nausea. He had had a recent injury -- had he accidentally taken too many aspirin to treat the pain in his elbow? By far the most common cause of hyperventilation in the emergency room is anxiety. Still, it was rare for hyperventilation to produce this much confusion.</p>
        <p>Could the hyperventilation be a reaction to the confusion and not the cause? The emergency-room physician ordered an intravenous solution of saline to be started. If he had been at the sauna for several hours, he was possibly dehydrated. If he had water intoxication, the sodium would be helpful. He sent blood and urine to the lab to be tested for evidence of drug use -- including aspirin.</p>
        <p>The blood would also reveal an infection or an electrolyte imbalance. In addition, the doctor ordered a test of the patient's arterial blood to check its acidity. He briefly considered doing a spinal tap to look for evidence of an infection in the brain or a CT scan to look for a brain injury. These diagnoses, he thought, were less likely, and so he would order these tests only if the others brought no answers.</p>
        <p>Then the patient's nurse took an oxygen mask, taped up the holes and positioned it over the patient's mouth and nose. The usual treatment for hyperventilation is to have the patient breathe in his own exhaled breath to increase the level of inhaled carbon dioxide. He was also given a small dose of anxiety-relieving medicine.</p>
        <p>3. Resolution  The arterial blood, taken so painfully from the wrist, immediately confirmed the diagnosis of hyperventilation. The repetitive deep sighs were making his blood too alkaline, and that was causing the visual changes and the clenched fingers. The rest of the results trickled in over the next hour or so. The drug screen was negative: no aspirin, no opiates, no ecstasy, PCP or cocaine. No evidence of infection was found either. However, his blood chemistries were quite abnormal: the sodium in his blood was dangerously low. The brain is exquisitely sensitive to the exact right balance of sodium and water. When they become abnormal, nausea and confusion follow. Hyponatremia, or having low sodium, can cause seizures, coma and even death if untreated. The IV of saline the patient was already getting would replace the electrolyte he had lost. ''He felt as if he were drunk,'' the physician explained to the patient's friends. ''And he was -- he was drunk on water.'' The patient began to improve in the next hour. The three friends kept the doctor up to date on the patient's progress in figuring out the year. ''He's up to 1999,'' they said gleefully. When he finally reached 2004, the group cheered. The patient was finally able to fill in some of the blanks. He had been worried about getting dehydrated at the sauna so he drank lots of water -- lots and lots of water.</p>
        <p>The patient was able to go home late that night, but it took him a week to really get back to normal. ''It's amazing,'' one friend told me later. ''To think that breathing, sweating and drinking water -- things we do every day -- can do all that to you.''</p>
