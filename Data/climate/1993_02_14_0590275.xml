        <p>Last fall, Mary Ann and Anthony Pasquale replaced the oil burner in their house, in Whitestone, Queens, with one that uses natural gas. "I think it's warmer," Mrs. Pasquale said. "We keep the thermostat around 69, and it's so hot in here sometimes. Before, we kept it at 72 and it wasn't as warm."</p>
        <p>But, she added after a moment, maybe that was just her imagination. Heating experts would agree with that theory; fuel choice should not make any difference, they say. No matter, the Pasquales are happy. Major Marketing War</p>
        <p>Rose Randolph is not. After the 35-year-old oil burner in her house in Flushing broke down last October, Mrs. Randolph called Consolidated Edison. The utility arranged for a contractor to install a new natural gas furnace that now keeps her house warm. But her last two monthly bills were $143 and $165, she said, compared to the $100 or less that she used to spend for oil every month.</p>
        <p>Experts would have trouble with that one, too; they say that fuel costs are about equal lately.</p>
        <p>The Pasquales and Mrs. Randolph, along with about 7 million other homeowners in the Northeast and 11.2 million nationwide, are the targets of a major marketing war between the natural gas utilities, now flush with fresh supplies from new pipelines and deregulated wells, and the oil dealers, who are fighting fiercely to hold on to their share. Though oil dealers claim to have competitive prices and superior technology, almost no one with a gas system goes to the trouble of installing a tank so a house can switch to oil.</p>
        <p>For consumers, it means an ordeal of claims and counterclaims every time they turn on the radio.</p>
        <p>Most of the ads touting oil heat carry the innuendo that natural gas is unsafe, without ever quite saying why. "Take a chance?" says a male voice in the oil ads. "Yeah, maybe on a lottery ticket. But gas in my house? O.K., so odds are nothing would go wrong -- but I'd rather not bet on it."</p>
        <p>"Our ads always have a subliminal line in them," said Robert Greenes of the Metropolitan Energy Council, which represents fuel oil dealers. But he contended that gas</p>
        <p>is</p>
        <p>less safe, mostly because it is more prone to produce carbon monoxide.</p>
        <p>The gas companies, on the other hand, often claim that their burners are more efficient than oil burners, which Government engineers say is not usually the case.</p>
        <p>The dueling ad campaigns have the two sides at each other's throat. "They're lying," said Mr. Greenes, the oil promoter.</p>
        <p>"We're dealing with a wily competitor," said Paul K. Morris, the director of gas sales and marketing at the Long Island Lighting Company. Stretching the Facts</p>
        <p>The fact is, said one Government engineer who has spent the last 15 years studying home heating system technology, "both of them are taking the facts and stretching them, and distorting them." The engineer, Roger J. McDonald of the Department of Energy's Brookhaven National Laboratory, said that for many homeowners the choice between fuels is "a tossup," and that more important decisions, like how efficient a furnace or a boiler a homeowner should buy, get hardly any attention.</p>
        <p>This is a strange war. On one side, the oil industry bolsters its case with studies from Greenpeace, hardly a traditional ally. (A Greenpeace study argues that unburned natural gas that escapes into the atmosphere contributes to the greenhouse effect, even though substituting natural gas for oil reduces production of carbon dioxide, another greenhouse gas.)</p>
        <p>On the other side, the gas industry hardly uses the word oil without attaching the pejorative "imported." But in the New York area, utilities are now able to sell more natural gas mostly because of the completion of the Iroquois pipeline, which brings gas here from Canada. 'Eliminates the Agita'</p>
        <p>The two sides can disagree about almost anything. At Con Edison, for example, Robert F. Crane, the vice president for gas business development, said in an interview that a major selling point is "you don't have to wait for a delivery. It eliminates the agita."</p>
        <p>But John D. Maniscalco, executive vice president of the New York Oil Heating Association Inc., made a circle with his thumb and forefinger, approximating the 2-inch diameter of the gas pipes that run from mains under the streets to meters in basements. "That delivery truck works a lot better than a little pipe," he said. "There are a lot of leaks in that pipeline."</p>
        <p>In fact, the only time in the recent past when there was a threat of a delivery problem, both fuels were affected. That was in December 1989, when extreme winter weather left fuel oil barges blocked by ice, interrupted some production of natural gas and strained gas transmission systems. Few 'Horror Stories'</p>
        <p>Another point of dispute is safety, but Mr. McDonald, of Brookhaven, pointed out that there are 92 million occupied housing units in this country, yet only occasional "horror stories" from any kind of heating system problem. "Basically, both of these are safe systems, statistically," he said. There is a risk to using either fuel to heat a house, he said, but "it's a lot safer than driving on the expressway every day."</p>
        <p>Even the oil dealers acknowledge that the explosion risk from natural gas is very small. They say a bigger risk is carbon monoxide poisoning, which can result from incomplete burning of fuel in an out-of-tune burner. Carbon monoxide can come from oil or gas, but if the oil burner goes out of whack it will produce smoke, a warning to the occupants, while the gas burner will produce only the colorless, odorless carbon monoxide.</p>
        <p>But others praise natural gas burners as being simple and less likely to have problems.</p>
        <p>The biggest clash is over the cost of fuel and the efficiency of the furnace or boiler, and both are the subject of confusion.</p>
        <p>Even the gas suppliers don't agree on the cost differences between the two fuels. Con Edison maintains that over the last 10 winters, the cost of No. 2 oil, the kind used in houses, has been equal to the cost of gas, per unit of heat content. "We don't claim the price of gas is going to be lower than the price of oil for a long time," said Mary Jane McCartney, vice president of gas supply.</p>
        <p>But Lilco says that gas has been nearly 20 percent cheaper than oil in its service territory in the last eight years.</p>
        <p>Oil dealers say that prices are now at parity and will stay that way over the long run. They point out that many dealers now offer their customers a contract with a guaranteed per-gallon price for the season.</p>
        <p>If prices are nearly equal, the key difference is efficiency, or how much of the fuel's heat is delivered to the house, versus how much goes up the chimney. Gas companies try to persuade homeowners that a new gas system would be substantially more efficient than their old oil systems, cutting fuel requirements by 10 or 15 percent. But if a furnace or boiler is on its last legs, experts say, a better question is how a new gas burner compares to a new oil burner.</p>
        <p>Here it appears, at least on the average, that oil has the upper hand. According to researchers at Brookhaven, the efficiency of gas equipment now being manufactured averages 78 percent, while oil equipment averages 86 percent. But at the American Gas Association, Mark E. Stultz, a spokesman, said that the efficiency of the best gas unit is higher than the efficiency of the best oil unit, and that in cold climates like New York's, homeowners tend to install very high-efficiency units.</p>
        <p>In either case, what the homeowner should consider is not the average efficiency, but the efficiency of the particular unit that the oil dealer or gas utility is trying to sell. This is measured by a federally mandated yardstick called the Annual Fuel Utilization Efficiency, known in the industry as Afue (pronounced A-few).</p>
        <p>Experts say that the houses where conversion is easiest are those that already have gas service, usually for cooking.</p>
        <p>At Brookhaven, Mr. McDonald suggests that consumers think about the choice without any of the near-Messianic overlay of the gas utilities' pitch. "They're not doing it to clean up the environment or save people money; they want to make money for their shareholders," he said. It may make more sense, he said, to add insulation in the attic or install a storm door, "something that will lower the heating load forever." And in dealing with oil dealers, he said, do not assume anything about the price of upgrades that would improve the efficiency of an old oil burner.</p>
        <p>"You can wheel and deal a lot," he said. "It's like buying a car."</p>
