        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>"Just Whose Ozone Hole Is It, Anyway?" (letter, Sept. 29) questions the belief that chlorofluorocarbons are the cause of ozone depletion above Australia. Indeed, for many people it will be hard to imagine that there is a causal relationship between the facts that 80 percent of CFC's are emitted in the Northern Hemisphere and that the ozone hole occurs in the Southern Hemisphere. This relationship has, however, been proved. For a conceptual understanding, it is sufficient to go through the following:</p>
        <p>* Only in higher regions of the atmosphere is solar radiation strong enough to free the chlorine and bromine present in CFCs. As vertical transport is relatively slow, it may take several years before CFC's reach these regions.</p>
        <p>* The winds CFC's encounter in their journey to higher regions of the atmosphere transport a part of the CFC's emitted in the Northern Hemisphere to the Southern Hemisphere, before chlorine and bromine are eventually freed by solar radiation.</p>
        <p>* Above the South Pole, as opposed to the situation above the North Pole, temperatures are continuously below -60 degrees Fahrenheit, and there is little influx of ozone-rich air from areas nearer to the equator.</p>
        <p>* When the sun comes up at the South Pole at the beginning of the Antarctic spring, which is about now, chlorine and bromine are freed from the CFC's. These agents react with ozone on the surface of polar stratospheric ice clouds, which only occur if temperatures are lower than -60 degrees. As this loss of ozone is not compensated for by the influx of ozone-rich air, an ozone hole -- which means up to 90 percent less ozone in regions in the stratosphere where ozone concentrations are normally highest -- is created over time.</p>
        <p>As one might then infer, the idea that the Antarctic ozone hole is caused by CFC's emitted mainly by Europeans and Americans has nothing to do with "emotional half-truths" as the letter puts it. Moreover, to address a question it poses, above Northern Europe the ozone layer has for the last two years been significantly thinner than the long-term running mean (up to 20 percent less in the beginning of October).</p>
        <p>For this year an even larger decrease is expected. In this respect, a Northern Hemispheric ozone hole is looming.  WIEGER FRANSEN  De Bilt, the Netherlands, Oct. 5, 1993 The writer is in the research department of the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute.</p>
