        <p>To sign his executive orders speeding federal approval of energy projects around the country, President Bush came to a Depression-era hydroelectric station today that stretches across the Susquehanna River and marveled at the ''fish lift'' that now enables shad to take an elevator ride over the huge dam to their spawning grounds.</p>

        <p>To sign his executive orders speeding federal approval of energy projects around the country, President Bush came to a Depression-era hydroelectric station today that stretches across the Susquehanna River and marveled at the ''fish lift'' that now enables shad to take an elevator ride over the huge dam to their spawning grounds.</p>
        <p>The backdrop was carefully chosen, the latest of several settings that cast Mr. Bush in the role of the compassionate conservationist. For the past two days, at energy plants in Minnesota, Iowa and here, Mr. Bush has acted like a man certain of his green credentials -- and a bit surprised that not everyone shares his confidence that American ingenuity will allow the country to drill in an Arctic refuge, build 1,300 power plants, keep driving sport utility vehicles and barely nick on the environment.</p>
        <p>''I firmly believe we can solve this problem,'' Mr. Bush said today. ''I know we can't solve it without a plan, and that's why I've laid one out.''</p>
        <p>But in laying it out, Mr. Bush has weighted his public remarks on his commitment to conservation, rather than the details of how to increase  the energy supply that lie at the core of the 163-page report outlining his strategy. Without question, he found it easier to make an optimistic case here than he would have exactly 28 miles upstream.</p>
        <p>There, just above the Safe Harbor Dam that he visited today, the four cooling towers of the Three Mile Island nuclear plant loom over the river, site of the accident 22 years ago that came to define a generation's understanding of environmental risk.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush never mentioned that accident today. He came close once, telling his small but enthusiastic audience that ''nuclear power is much safer than it's ever been,'' his way into an argument that the long moratorium on building new nuclear plants must now end.</p>
        <p>Not once in the past two days has he publicly mentioned another key recommendation in his report: to re-evaluate an American ban on breeder reactors and the reprocessing of nuclear fuel, a once-promising technology that was abandoned in the Carter administration as too risky and too likely to let separated plutonium slip into the hands of terrorists.</p>
        <p>There is little doubt that Mr. Bush speaks from the heart when he insists that the United States should not be forced into what he calls a ''false choice'' between energy production and environmental conservation. His love of the outdoors is obvious. He tells friends he lives for his moments at his ranch in Texas, where the Brazos River cuts through his land, and he escapes to Camp David on almost any weekend when a trip back home seems too difficult.</p>
        <p>But in January, Mr. Bush also told two visitors to his ranch that ''I understand the Western mentality, and I want the Western mentality represented in this administration.''</p>
        <p>''It's part of that big swath of red on the map,'' he said, referring to the states he swept in the November presidential election. In that conversation, Mr. Bush remarked somewhat dismissively about his opponent for president, Al Gore, characterizing his view as ''we will conserve our way out of the crisis.''</p>
        <p>This week, Mr. Bush has modified that message. Perhaps mindful of the polls that show many Americans worrying that his administration is too attuned to the desires of the oil and gas industries from which several cabinet members have sprung, he has waxed on about the wonders of renewable energy. Thursday, it was a plant that burns wood chips and turkey waste, and a biomass plant that burns agricultural byproducts. Today, it was the shad-friendly hydroelectric dam.</p>
        <p>''I hope some day that these renewables will be the dominant source of energy in America,'' Mr. Bush said, adding, ''I'm not so sure how realistic that is.''</p>
        <p>Even his drive to clear away the bureaucratic hurdles to new energy plants has been hedged with assurances that he is not about to sacrifice the environment. He simply wants to balance the cost-benefit equation, he suggested today when he signed an executive order requiring federal agencies to issue an ''energy impact statement'' along with the long-required ''environmental impact statement.'' And he said that whenever his administration searched for new places to drill, he would be ''mindful of the environment.''</p>
        <p>But he carefully sidestepped imposing standards that industry must meet, notably standards for greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
        <p>Environmental groups leaped on that decision.</p>
        <p>''Climate is the elephant in the middle of the living room that the authors of the report didn't want to talk about,'' said Joseph Goffman, the senior lawyer at Environmental Defense, a research and lobbying group that was highly critical of Mr. Bush's decision to declare the Kyoto treaty on global warming dead. ''There is nothing in there that would require the integration of policies to bring down greenhouse gas emissions.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's other political calculation is to make clear that he is asking for no sacrifice from consumers.</p>
        <p>He talked today about his enthusiasm for more fuel-efficient cars, and his report calls for a $4 billion tax credit for consumers who buy a new generation of hybrids, which combine gas and electricity, and charge their batteries from the energy lost when drivers hit the brakes. But he never made reference to the American love affair with sport utility vehicles.</p>
        <p>A report released last month by the Council on Foreign Relations, and presented to Vice President Dick Cheney's task force, noted that if the fuel efficiency requirements for sport utility vehicles matched that of cars, the savings would amount to 225,000 barrels of oil a day. If the requirements were applied to all light trucks, the savings would amount to over 900,000 barrels a day, or 50 percent more than Mr. Bush would extract from the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve.</p>
        <p>Asked about sport utility vehicles on Thursday, Mr. Bush's spokesman, Ari Fleischer, noted that the House minority leader, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, also seemed unconcerned about the symbolism of the gas-guzzlers when arriving at an event to release a Democratic energy plan.</p>
        <p>''The president thought the fact that Dick Gephardt was driven to his news conference in an S.U.V. should not be used against him,'' Mr. Fleischer said.</p>
