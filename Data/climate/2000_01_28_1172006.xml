        <p>Around midnight last night, Juan Mayr, who is chairman of the global biosafety talks here, told delegates after a long day of negotiations to go back to their hotel rooms and ''dream about the precautionary approach.''</p>
        <p>It was a reference to one of the most important issues remaining in the effort to formulate the world's first treaty regulating trade in genetically modified products: Must a nation have scientific proof before it can ban a genetically engineered crop or animal? Or can it act even in the absence of scientific certainty?</p>
        <p>The ''precautionary principle,'' which allows erring on the side of safety in the absence of scientific certainty, has been enshrined in numerous environmental laws and treaties since the 1970's, but often more as a vague statement of philosophy than as a recipe for action. Depending on the outcome of negotiations here, an agreement on bio safety might contain a strong formulation authorizing the precautionary principle to be used in decision making, setting a precedent for other international agreements.</p>
        <p>It could also set a precedent for domestic debates in the United States, where controversy over food made using biotechnology is growing. Virtually no evidence exists that such foods are harmful. But critics say there is not enough information about possible health effects, so the foods should be banned or more tightly regulated.</p>
        <p>In negotiations over the biosafety agreement, the United States and several other big agricultural exporting nations say that incorporating the precautionary principle too strongly would allow countries to ban imports of genetically modified corn, soybeans or other crops simply based on fear or protectionism.</p>
        <p>''There have been some proposals that we think would redefine the concept,'' Frank E. Loy, under secretary of state for global affairs, said today. ''It would have the effect of justifying restrictions on biotechnology, including import bans, without any scientific basis.''</p>
        <p>But European countries and the developing countries, which have been pitted against the United States and a handful of its allies all week, say precaution is justified because not enough is known about the environmental effects of genetic engineering. And if a ''superweed'' or dangerous bacteria were to get loose in the environment, it could not be recalled like a defective car. ''Countries must be able to have the freedom, the sovereign right to take precautionary measures,'' said Christoph Bail, the lead negotiator for the European Union. Once damage occurs, he said, ''it would be too late to do anything about it.''</p>
        <p>European officials say they are not advocating abandoning an approach based on science. ''You cannot take action based on just fear,'' said Margot Wallstrom, the environmental commissioner of the European Union. ''You need some evidence, you need some scientific basis for action.''</p>
        <p>Some officials point out that the United States itself has endorsed the precautionary principle in treaties such as the Kyoto agreement on climate change. Steps are being taken to control gases that contribute to planetary warming, even though it could be argued that the evidence that such warming will occur is not conclusive.</p>
        <p>Washington wants to make sure any agreement on biosafety does not take precedence over the World Trade Organization rules. That is because under W.T.O. rules an import can be banned only on the basis of scientific evidence.</p>
