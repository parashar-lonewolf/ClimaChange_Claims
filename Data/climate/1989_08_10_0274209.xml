        <p>LEAD: The latest surveys by the Environmental Protection Agency merely confirm what every sensate New Yorker knows just by going out the front door: New York City has some of the foulest air in the country. The city needs to reduce hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxide emissions by a staggering 60 percent just to meet existing Federal health standards for ozone, the main component of urban smog.</p>
        <p>The latest surveys by the Environmental Protection Agency merely confirm what every sensate New Yorker knows just by going out the front door: New York City has some of the foulest air in the country. The city needs to reduce hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxide emissions by a staggering 60 percent just to meet existing Federal health standards for ozone, the main component of urban smog. It needs almost as large a reduction to meet Federal standards for carbon monoxide.</p>
        <p>Thus New Yorkers have special reason to examine President Bush's proposals to overhaul the Clean Air Act of 1970 - and to ask whether they will do the job. The answer: They'll help, but not nearly enough to bring New York into compliance.</p>
        <p>There is much to applaud in the Bush bill. It's a major departure from years of Reagan indifference. It contains a serious proposal to fight acid rain. And, by requiring the gradual phasing in of cars built to run on ''clean fuels,'' it will force industry to think creatively about new technologies.</p>
        <p>However, in an effort to persuade auto makers to explore alternative fuels, and to win support from Representative John Dingell and other industry champions in Congress, Mr. Bush struck a bad bargain. The bill sets tougher standards for tailpipe emissions like hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide. But, perhaps fatally, it would also allow auto makers to ''average'' the pollution of all cars rather than keeping each individual car below allowable levels. Since pollution from today's new cars is already below even Mr. Bush's stricter standards, the averaging provision could well lead to an increase in emissions.</p>
        <p>Mobile sources - mainly cars and light trucks - account for half the smog problem and nearly all the carbon monoxide. The Bush bill would thus be bad news for New York City and other heavily congested urban areas. It would also place a disproportionately heavy cleanup burden on stationary sources large and small, like factories, refineries and even neighborhood dry cleaners.</p>
        <p>New York State could attack tailpipe emissions by imposing stricter standards on all cars sold in the state, as California has done for years. And New York's aggressive state Environmental Conservation Commissioner, Thomas Jorling, is prepared to do just that. But since much of New York City's automobile pollution is imported from Connecticut, New Jersey and elsewhere, he'd obviously prefer tough standards that apply to all cars.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jorling has also warned that, absent strong Federal legislation, he may be forced to take Draconian measures - banning older cars from the city, for example, and inducing greater use of mass transportation by dramatically raising tolls.</p>
        <p>Such measures may be necessary in any case; no bill before Congress, including tough and sound proposals offered by Representative Henry Waxman, would bring New York into compliance any time soon. But the Bush bill is a weak start, and clearly needs strengthening in Congress.</p>
