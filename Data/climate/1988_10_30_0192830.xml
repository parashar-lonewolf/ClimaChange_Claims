        <p>LEAD: RECENTLY, we have become acutely aware of an incipient problem that has been with us for years, but until now has only been the concern of the proverbial ''they.''</p>
        <p>RECENTLY, we have become acutely aware of an incipient problem that has been with us for years, but until now has only been the concern of the proverbial ''they.''</p>
        <p>For until now it has been ''they'' who warned us of the greenhouse effect, ''they'' who warned us about the ozone layer, ''they'' who warned us about pollution of our air and water, ''they'' who warned us about our mounting waste disposal problems. But until 1988, ''we'' didn't worry about it because we thought that ''they'' were alarmists and everything would, in the end, be all right.</p>
        <p>As ''we'' have learned, these problems will not go away and are not getting better. What also has become apparent is that these problems are not only all related but are indicative of serious social problems endemic to our entire country.</p>
        <p>The problem can be simply stated: We all must become aware of and responsible for our own waste. Whether this waste is in the form of carbon monoxide from cars, sewage disposal from industries and homes, or household waste, each of us must change the way we think.</p>
        <p>For example, one of the most striking things New Yorkers notice when they visit Europe is ''how clean the cities are.'' Is it any surprise then to learn that the per-capita production of solid waste in Europe is half to a third that of America's? (The ratio is even higher for Long Island, but that's another story).</p>
        <p>In Japan, children in school are taught the four R's: reading, writing, arithmetic and recycling. Is it any wonder that not only do the Japanese waste less, but more important, they have inculcated in their children the unacceptability of the throwaway society that we so readily accept?</p>
        <p>The problems that slapped us in the face this summer, specifically the excessive heat and humidity with the unavailability of our beaches to act as a respite, should incite us to action. But we must be careful not to address just the tip of the iceberg, i.e. the medical waste and sludge, but to address the overall problem of waste disposal, of which these are only part.</p>
        <p>As a first priority, we must learn to reduce the amount of garbage we produce. Basic examples of this strategy would include less packaging for our products. Most department stores these days wrap your package in a bag, and then give you a bag to put the bag in. Many consumer products in fact come prepackaged, with excessive packaging to begin with. We then exacerbate the problem by adding more needless layers.</p>
        <p>Another example of waste production is throwaway utensils. Why must we use plastic forks, spoons and knives when we take food out to our offices and homes? Why can't we use our everyday silverware at home, and when in the office, bring a set to use and re-use? A little effort goes a long way. Minimally, the alternative should be a surcharge for the disposal cost of the plastic utensils.</p>
        <p>The most basic and all-encompassing strategy we must adopt is recycling. Recycling can and should be the principal method of dealing with the bulk of our solid waste.</p>
        <p>Recycling covers just about everything from bottles and cans to the composting of our solid food wastes. It is the safest, cheapest and most efficient solution there is to our solid waste problem. Recycling never polluted a stream, never killed a dolphin, never contaminated any water supplies. Recycling never killed anyone.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, these two basic stategies have not been embraced by New York City and most of the towns on Long Island. Instead, municipalities have proposed the unsafe and unproven technology of incineration as the cornerstone of their strategies. Incineration, compared with recycling, disposes less of the waste stream than recycling does, yet costs substantially more per ton of disposal. Worst of all, incineration simply has not been proven safe to use beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
        <p>As if all these disadvantages weren't enough, incineration exacerbates every problem that ''they'' have been telling us about. In the first place, it doesn't solve the basic problem of waste disposal because it creates one ton of toxic ash for every four burned. ''They'' have been telling us that we are running out of places and ways to dispose of our society's toxic wastes. In fact, there are no Federal, state or local standards for the disposal of toxic ash.</p>
        <p>Secondly, ''they'' have warned us of our endangered water supply. Well, the average incinerator uses one million gallons of water per day. ''They'' have also warned us about the buildup of sludge in our waters, but the local sewage plant is where that 11 million gallons (11 units have been proposed on Long Island) will go.</p>
        <p>Finally, ''they'' have warned us that our air is already sufficiently full of dangerous ozone (not the good layer we want at the top of our atmosphere) making the air we breathe (especially on hot summer days) unhealthy. We don't need more ozone caused by the burning of more fossil fuels and we certainly don't need dioxin (a deadly byproduct of incineration) added to the mess.</p>
        <p>''We'' now must take command of our own destiny. ''We'' have it within our abilities. However ''we'' must change the social acceptability of excessive waste production and unsafe disposal methods as the first step.</p>
