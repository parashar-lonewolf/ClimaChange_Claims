        <p>The tiger in your tank is about to be reformulated. Federal and state air-pollution regulations have already required some changes in gasoline around the nation, and many more are coming by 1995.</p>
        <p>The object is to clean up what comes out of the tailpipe. The question is: How will the engine like it?</p>
        <p>Maybe better, maybe worse than with the fuel sold now, depending on the age of the car and the estimate of the engineer. Pessimists say that some older cars, with carburetors, may tend to stall on reformulated fuel. Some may be harder to start on cold mornings. But newer cars, with fuel injection, may perform better. And car exhaust will not smell as bad. A Change in Priorities</p>
        <p>There will also be less hype in the marketplace, said William R. Berman, the chief environmental affairs lobbyist of the American Automobile Association. Oil companies now push hard to sell high-octane gasoline, Mr. Berman said, because the companies make a bigger profit margin on that grade, but it does most cars no good. But when the new fuel regulations take effect, refineries will be so strained meeting the standards that they will not have the equipment to produce as much high-octane fuel, he said, and "instead of high-octane gas you'll have 'green' gas, which is better for all of us."</p>
        <p>The price will not be better, though. Estimates vary on how much more the new gas will cost to produce. The price at the pump, as always, will be determined by what the market will bear. But an additional 25 cents a gallon or so would not surprise many refiners and regulators.</p>
        <p>Widespread changes in gasoline began in the late 1980's, when regulators in New York, New Jersey and the six New England states required the reduction of gasoline "volatility," or the tendency of the liquid to evaporate. The goal was to reduce the volume of hydrocarbon fumes that rise into the atmosphere and, after cooking in the summer sun with nitrogen oxides, turn into smog.</p>
        <p>But from the engine's point of view, volatility is desirable. While gasoline may be sold as a liquid, in the cylinders it is burned as a gas, and fuel that will not turn to a gas will not burn thoroughly.</p>
        <p>When the eight Northeastern states first debated requiring lower volatility in fuel sold in summer, some oil companies and even the A.A.A. warned that on cold mornings in the late spring or early fall, cars might not start. That complication never developed, most people now agree, and new Environmental Protection Agency rules require that south of Washington, fuel volatility be cut further this summer.</p>
        <p>When that rule takes effect, said Allen A. Kozinski, the vice president of research and development at the Amoco Oil Company in Chicago, maintaining "driveability" will require careful mixing of the various chemical components of gasoline. Volatility will be cut by reducing the content of two chemicals that tend to boil away first, butane and isopentane, and some other chemicals that are slow to vaporize will have to be removed from fuel, he said, and slightly lighter ones substituted.</p>
        <p>Carbureted cars are the most sensitive to fuel volatility reductions, he said, and may tend to hesitate or stall. "On the other hand, those drivers are used to that," he said, adding that cars with fuel injection will be affected less.</p>
        <p>Mr. Berman, of the A.A.A., said he favored studies by the E.P.A. to measure the effects of reformulated gas on cars. "Why should the motorist become a guinea pig for the evolution in gasoline chemistry?" he said.</p>
        <p>But some oil companies have made changes voluntarily and are advertising that their gasoline helps clean the air. And Mr. Kozinski said that Amoco had tested its gasoline on 60 cars of various vintages and brands and had found no difficulties.</p>
        <p>People who own newer cars will benefit from the new gasolines, said Walter M. Kreucher, the manager for advanced environmental and fuels engineering at the Ford Motor Company. They must have detergents to clean fuel injectors, he said, while today only about three-quarters of gas has the optimum amount of detergents.</p>
        <p>The reason for the requirement is that if the fuel has no detergents, impurities can plug a fuel port, throwing off the air-fuel ratio. Late-model cars have exhaust sensors connected to a computer processor that will try to correct the problem by injecting more fuel into all the cylinders, but this will throw off the balance in all the other cylinders, defeating the car's antipollution system.</p>
        <p>Another advantage of the reformulated fuel, Mr. Kreucher and others say, is a lower level of sulfur, which gives car exhaust a rotten-egg smell.</p>
        <p>In many cities, including Denver and Phoenix, gasoline with oxygen is already required in winter. The idea of oxygenated gasoline is to promote fuller combustion, with more production of carbon dioxide and less production of carbon monoxide. This will not make much difference in the emissions from newer cars, whose tailpipe sensors will measure the fuel-air ratio and adjust accordingly. But it will cut emissions from older cars.</p>
        <p>Under Federal law, nine cities with the worst summer air pollution will soon get fuel with oxygen, as well as other changes. They are Hartford, New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Houston, Chicago, Milwaukee, San Diego and Los Angeles. State officials in other areas are expected to adopt the reformulated gas, too.</p>
        <p>Oxygenated gas may cut mileage slightly, because molecules bearing an oxygen atom are already partly burned and thus have less energy in them. Will motorists notice this loss, which will probably come to 1.5 to 2 percent? "It depends on how well they track it," Mr. Kozinski said.</p>
