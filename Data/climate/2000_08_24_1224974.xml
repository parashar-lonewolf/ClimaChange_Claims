        <p>Reno Discusses Gore Decision  Attorney General Janet Reno portrayed her decision not to name a special prosecutor to investigate Vice President Al Gore's statements about his role in 1996 fund-raising activities as a one that cleared him only of making false statements in an April 18 interview with investigators. She said the four-year inquiry into fund-raising would continue.</p>

        <p>Taking a Step on Warming  Texas' three natural resource commissioners, all appointees of Gov. George W. Bush, said global warming was a serious problem and that the state would explore ways to cut its emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases.</p>

        <p>EDUCATION</p>
        <p>Rush to Certify Teachers  A growing number of states and school districts are short-circuiting the usual route to teacher certification with crash courses that put new teachers in the classroom after as little as three weeks of training.</p>

        <p>Police Say Counselor Led Missing Boys to River  The search continued for two teenage boys from a state psychiatric center who were swept away in the Hudson on Tuesday.

        <p>Alcohol Ban Is Eased  Less than two weeks after the Giuliani administration announced a ban on alcohol sales along parade routes, city officials backed off a police proposal to end sales at street festivals. Alcohol sales will be allowed at the Feast of San Gennaro in Little Italy but the number of vendors will be cut in half. Organizers of other events complained of a double standard.</p>

        <p>Rules for Stem Cell Research  The National Institutes of Health issued rules that would let federally financed researchers work on cells derived from very early embryos.
