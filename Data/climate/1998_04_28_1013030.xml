      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Nobuhiko Kawamoto, the engineer who has led Honda to record profits and market shares in the United States and Japan over the last eight years, announced yesterday his retirement as president and chief executive.</p>
        <p>Hiroyuki Yoshino, one of the Honda Motor Company's two executive vice presidents and the president of Honda's research and vehicle development division, was chosen to succeed Mr. Kawamoto.</p>
        <p>Industry executives and analysts predicted that Mr. Yoshino's succes sion to the top job would result in few if any changes because he has been close to Mr. Kawamoto, succeeding him as president of the research division. Both men joined Honda's research division in April 1963, and have spent most of their careers in that division and in Honda's small but prestigious racing division.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kawamoto, who is 62 years old, made his reputation within Honda in 1974 by working on the team that designed the first engine by any auto maker that met Federal clean air regulations in the United States without needing a catalytic converter. Mr. Yoshino was the first engineer Honda sent to the United States in the late 1960's to study the need for cleaner-burning engines, and also worked on the new engine in 1974 and other, more recent low-pollution engines. More recently, Mr. Kawamoto has infuriated Detroit auto executives by outspokenly contending that global warming is a serious problem that the auto industry should address.</p>
        <p>The choice of Mr. Yoshino nonetheless surprised some auto industry officials because he is 58 years old. Honda has traditionally chosen presidents who are young by Japanese standards, typically in their late 40's or early 50's; indeed, the company has a mandatory retirement age of 60 for all but its highest executives. Mr. Kawamoto's predecessor, Tadashi Kume, retired at 58 in June 1990.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kawamoto will remain at Honda as an adviser, but will not become the chairman. At many Japanese companies, retiring chief executives become chairmen. But the post of chairman at Honda is largely ceremonial, and all four chairmen over the years have been former executive vice presidents who were passed over for the job of president.</p>
        <p>While the appointment of Mr. Yoshino remains subject to approval by Honda's shareholders in late June, that is largely a formality in Japan.</p>
        <p>Seven years of economic weakness in Japan have created serious problems for the auto industry there, but Honda has weathered them better than its rivals. Profits have more than tripled during Mr. Kawamoto's tenure, to $1.78 billion in the fiscal year that ended on March 31, 1997. Results for the year that ended last month are not officially available, but Honda has said it will be another record year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kawamoto made two big decisions that have produced bonanzas for Honda in Japan and the United States, but at a critical time in Europe he made a choice that may haunt the company for many years.</p>
        <p>When the Japanese economy began to weaken in the early 1990's, many auto makers, including a big rival of Honda's, Mitsubishi Motors, began slowing investment in new models. But Mr. Kawamoto actually increased Honda's spending on research and vehicle development, and produced such highly popular models as the CR-V sport utility vehicle and the new Accord, both of which went on sale last year. Honda's sales have been rising in Japan even as the overall market there shrinks, while its market share has soared.</p>
        <p>''Honda redoubled its investments, and take a look at where it is today -- it has romped all over Mitsubishi Motors and its other Japanese competitors,'' said Jay N. Woodworth, a consultant in Summit, N.J., who specializes in Asian auto makers.</p>
        <p>At the same time, Mr. Kawamoto invested heavily to expand Honda's manufacturing capability in the United States. This insulated the company from the effects of a strong yen in the mid-1990's, which made it expensive to ship cars from Japan.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Kawamoto also decided against buying Rover Group in Britain. Honda actually owned a 20 percent stake in Rover, but decided not to bid for the entire company when British Aerospace P.L.C. sold its 80 percent stake in 1994. Bayerische Motoren Werke A.G. of Germany bought Rover, eventually including Honda's stake, for a price that seemed cheap at the time and looks like an even better deal for BMW now that the sport utility vehicle craze has made Land Rovers popular. Rover also sells small cars in Europe, a market where Honda has been weak.</p>
        <p>Following a company motto that ''Small is smart,'' Honda has also been slow to respond to the demand for large sport utility vehicles in the United States. Honda, which sells a small sport utility called the Passport, is at least a year away from introducing its first large model.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kawamoto has been an iconoclast at a company that has at times seemed to pride itself on audacity, a rare quality in corporate Japan. Japanese business leaders rank Honda alongside the Sony Corporation as a Japanese company in name but a Western company in spirit, a combination that generates pride and criticism at the same time.</p>
        <p>Honda's decision to study whether to re-enter the high-stakes, strutting world of Formula One racing this year was considered vintage Kawamoto and greeted by some commentators as unnecessarily flashy and expensive. The company withdrew from competition in 1992 when its financial condition deteriorated.</p>
        <p>''Upon close examination, the external environment is no more accommodating now than it was when the company left the circuit,'' the Nikkei Weekly scolded in March. ''And if Honda doesn't get some tangible results for its time and money, fiscal results will suffer again.''</p>
