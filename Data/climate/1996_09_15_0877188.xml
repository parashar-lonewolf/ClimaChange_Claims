        <p>QUICK, setting out from Paris, where can one combine great art, stirring history, magnificent scenery, superb food and wine, and still be back in town in time for dinner?</p>
        <p>Easy. In Champagne.</p>
        <p>Ninety minutes from Paris by car, an hour by train, begins one of the most fascinating, and least familiar, sections of  France. Everyone knows about le Champagne, probably the world's best-known wine. But la Champagne, the region where it's made, is something else again. A region rich in history and culture, Champagne's farms and vineyards and unspoiled villages represent the best of rural France, its restaurants and hotels are first quality and its two cities, Rheims and Epernay, sit on top of several hundred million bottles of great wine.</p>
        <p>Almost as large as Belgium, the region is nonetheless virtually unknown territory to many travelers, and particularly the crowds going to Disneyland Paris, practically next door.</p>
        <p>Which is a pity. For Champagne is the birthplace of modern France.</p>
        <p>The weight of history is everywhere. The Romans came in 57 B.C. and made Durocotorum, later Rheims, an important city in Roman Gaul. The chalk vaults from which they carved their building blocks can be visited today. They shelter millions of bottles of aging wine.</p>
        <p>According to legend, St. Remi, Bishop of Rheims, converted Clovis, King of the Franks, to Christianity in 496, setting a pattern that lasted for well over a thousand years.</p>
        <p>In all, 37 kings of France were crowned at Rheims, beginning with Charlemagne's son, Louis the Pious, in 816, and ending with Charles X in 1825. Charles VII, with Joan of Arc at his side, was crowned there in 1429.</p>
        <p>There are no more kings but the great French Gothic cathedral remains. Built on the foundations of a fourth-century church, it was begun in 1211 and finished, more or less, a century later. It was shelled by the Germans in the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, and again in World War I, when its magnificent stained glass windows were  destroyed.</p>
        <p>Restored, partly with Rockefeller Foundation funds, the cathedral was reopened in 1938 and somehow missed the destruction suffered by much of the rest of Rheims in World War II.</p>
        <p>Since the defeat of Attila the Hun at Chalons-sur-Marne in 451, Champagne has been a battleground. Verdun and Chateau-Thierry are close at hand and at every turn in the road there seems to be another cemetery for French, German, American, British or Canadian soldiers. In 1914, the famous Taxis de la Marne brought up from Paris the reinforcements who helped stop the Germans at the gates of Rheims.</p>
        <p>Epernay, the second city of Champagne, was itself burned, sacked or pillaged at least 25 times in the thousand years before the 17th century.</p>
        <p>Napoleon fought his last battles in Champagne. The day before Epernay fell to Russian and Prussian troops in the spring of 1814, Napoleon bestowed his own cross of the Legion of Honor on the mayor of the city, Jean-Remy Moet, a loyal friend. Then he left for Paris and his abdication.</p>
        <p>Despite the region's size, authorized plantings of Champagne grapes amount to only about 68,000 acres. The best vineyards are on the Montagne de Reims, between Rheims, as it is spelled in English, and Epernay, but Champagne grapes are grown  as far west as Chateau-Thierry and as far south as Les Riceys, in the department of the Aube, southeast of Paris and only a few miles north of Burgundy.</p>
        <p>Modern Champagne is made from three grapes, chardonnay, a white wine grape, and pinot noir and pinot meunier, both red wine grapes. The harvest is usually in late September and early October -- a particularly delightful time to visit. (The cellars are open all year, but winter can be chilly and foggy.) Like all wines, Champagne undergoes a first fermentation that changes the grape juice into wine. Next comes the blending stage when the wine maker chooses how much chardonnay, pinot noir and pinot meunier, each of which has been fermented separately, he wants. A blanc de blancs will be all chardonnay, a blanc de noirs, all pinot noir and pinot meunier.</p>
        <p>If he is making a nonvintage champagne, the wine maker will add wines from as many as 10 earlier years to achieve the style he wants. Wines from vineyards all over the  region will be used in the blend. Few Champagne houses grow all their own grapes; some grow none. They depend on the 19,000 individual growers in the region.</p>
        <p>After blending, the wine maker adds liqueur de tirage, a blend of sugar and yeast that starts the second fermentation. At this point the wine is bottled under a temporary metal cap.</p>
        <p>The second fermentation produces carbon dioxide, too, but since it can't get out, it remains in suspension in the wine. This fermentation also produces sediment -- dead yeast cells. The bottles are placed in racks, head down, so the sediment can drift down to the neck. Each day the bottles are given a slight twist to shake the sediment down.</p>
        <p>Next, the bottle neck is dipped into a brine solution to freeze it. The metal cap is removed and the sediment along with a bit of frozen wine is pushed out by the carbon dioxide. A dollop of wine and sugar, called a dosage, is added to make up for the frozen lump of wine and sediment just ejected and, finally, the bottle is closed with a real cork.</p>
        <p>Then it is laid down to age, at least a year for nonvintage and three for vintage. Some companies age their best wines for up to 10 years. In any case, the wine is ready to drink when sold; further aging is unnecessary -- although there are people who like old Champagne, with its darker color and pronounced nutty flavor.</p>
        <p>At Moet &amp; Chandon, in Epernay, tour guides explain all this in a brief slide show before they conduct visitors through the company's vast cellars. Moet &amp; Chandon is the largest Champagne house, with some 90 million bottles of wine aging in its cellars at any given time, but almost every major firm and many of the smaller ones are eager to welcome visitors and reveal to them the mysteries of what is known as the Methode Champenoise.</p>
        <p>Moet is the biggest but not the oldest. That title goes to Ruinart, in Rheims, which was founded in 1729. Actually Gosset, in the village of Ay, near Epernay, dates back to 1584, but they were making still wine in those days and didn't get around to Champagne until much later.</p>
        <p>To a casual visitor, the Champagne region is a place of prosperous farms, quaint villages and the two substantial cities, Rheims and Epernay. There are always trucks about, laden with Champagne on its way to the world's markets, and at harvest time the smell of crushed grapes is everywhere.</p>
        <p>But although it is big business, for the most part, the Champagne business is discreetly run. Often only a brass wall plaque identifies the famous firm within. The real drama takes place out of sight, in the miles and miles of cellars that honeycomb the chalk subsoil, sometimes descending seven levels below the streets. There, the bottles age in semi-darkness, high humidity and a natural temperature that never varies from a steady 50 degrees.</p>
        <p>The cellars at Mercier, in Epernay, are so vast that visitors are shown through them on an electric train. In the past, heads of state were shown through the Mercier cellars in horse-drawn carriages.</p>
        <p>Mercier is the largest-selling brand of Champagne in France and, consequently, the most visited house. Each year it receives a quarter of a million guests in its cellars in the Avenue de Champagne. The company is owned by the Groupe Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy, L.M.V.H., whose other Champagne holdings include Moet &amp; Chandon, Veuve Clicquot-Ponsardin, Pommery, Canard-Duchene, de Venoge and Ruinart.</p>
        <p>Moet charges $4 for a visit, including a thorough explanation of the Champagne process, an instructive tour and a tasting. Others on the same street include de Castellane -- where the tour and tasting cost $5 --  with its museum and extraordinary crenelated tower, and Perrier-Jouet, famed for the Art Nouveau-style bottle that holds its Cuvee Belle Epoque, and its exquisite guest house, seen only by appointment.</p>
        <p>Epernay producers that can be visited only by appointment include Pol Roger, Churchill's Champagne house of choice, and, in nearby Ay, Bollinger and Deutz. Visitors who arrange to go to the Maison Deutz can choose between a $6 and a $12 ''prestige'' tasting. Appointments to see cellars are not hard to make. A fax or a phone call will do it; or ask a hotel concierge or the Champagne tourist offices in Rheims and Epernay. Language is never a problem; even the smallest company has someone around who speaks English. Last month, a young English guide at Moet noted rather slyly that Mercier had recently added a guide who understood the Scots.</p>
        <p>Someone once decribed Rheims as a city perched atop a giant Gruyere cheese. If so, it's a valuable cheese indeed. Mumm alone keeps 35 million bottles of its Cordon Rouge and other labels under its headquarters in the Rue du Champ-de-Mars. Along with a tour of the cellars, Mumm offers a film and commentary on Champagne production, a visit to its museum and a tasting.</p>
        <p>Pommery's 11 miles of wine cellars include spectacular galleries carved out of the chalk by the Romans. The Taittinger tour offers a tasting and a visit to the caves, the vestiges of a 13th-century chapel and the crypt of the 15th-century abbey of St. Nicaise, all on the property. Veuve Clicquot-Ponsardin's tour and tasting are by appointment. Charles Heidsieck, Ruinart, Henriot and Roederer are other Rheims-based Champagne houses that welcome visitors only by appointment. Most visitors head for the big companies whose names they know, but for French-speakers, a visit to one of the many small producers out in the Champagne villages can be even more rewarding. Customers drive out from Paris, share a fraternal bottle with the proprietor at his kitchen table, buy a few cases and haul them home in the trunk of the car. Several hundred of these small houses do a thriving ''cellar door'' and mail-order business.</p>
        <p>My favorite is the house of Ricciuti-Revolte, in Avenay-Val-d'Or, near Epernay. Baltimore-born Al Ricciuti met his wife-to-be while serving in the Army in France in World War II. Later he moved to France and joined her family's Champagne business, which he now runs. He is undoubtedly the best Champagne maker ever to come out of Baltimore.</p>
        <p>ANOTHER inducement to visit the region is the restaurant renaissance that has taken place there, led by Gerard Boyer's elegant and expensive Les Crayeres, just outside Rheims. Among the best are the old, reliable Royal Champagne at Champillon, on the road between Rheims and Epernay; Au Petit Comptoir, in Rheims; the Auberge de Relais at Reuilly-Sauvigny, near Chateau-Thierry; La Cote 108 at Berry au Bac; the Chateau de Fere at Fere-en-Tardenois and Jacky Michel in l'Epine.</p>
        <p>Epernay and Rheims both consider themselves the capital of Champagne, and if possible a visitor should experience them both. For train travelers, Epernay might have an edge, as the Avenue de Champagne with nine famous houses is only a few steps from the railroad station. Some hardy voyagers board another train at Epernay and go on to Rheims. Bottom line? Rent a car in Paris and drive out. Or better yet, take the train and rent a car in Epernay. Tour the region at leisure, return the car to Epernay and relax on the train back to Paris. Tell the conductor you've just spent an unforgettable day or two in Champagne and to please wake you at the Gare du Nord.</p>

        <p>Cellar Visits</p>
        <p>Most major and many smaller houses of the several hundred throughout the Champagne region welcome visitors; some are free, but generally there is a modest fee for the tour. The three given below are among the largest. Some houses, such as Pol Roger in Epernay, require an appointment, which is easily made with a phone call or fax from you or your hotel concierge or the Office of Tourism.</p>
        <p>Moet &amp; Chandon, 18 Avenue de Champagne, Epernay; telephone 26.51.20.00. Open every day from April 1 to Nov. 11. From Monday to Friday except on holidays for the rest of the year; fee, about $4, computed at 5 francs to $1.</p>
        <p>Champagne Mumm, 29 Rue du Champs-de-Mars, Rheims;  26.49.59.69. Open all year; fee, $4.</p>
        <p>Mercier, 68-70 Avenue de Champagne, Epernay; 26.51.22.22. Open every day March through November, closed Tuesday and Wednesday December through February; $4.</p>
        <p>Most of the Grandes Maisons of Champagne keep similar hours. Consult the Offices of Tourism for schedules and last-minute changes.</p>
        <p>Office of Tourism, 7 Avenue de Champagne 51201, Epernay;  26.53.33.00. Office of Tourism, 2 Rue Guillaume-de-Machault 51100, Rheims; 26.77.45.25.</p>
        <p>Hotels</p>
        <p>RHEIMS :  Les Crayeres, 643 Boulevard Vasnier; 26.82.80.80, fax 26.82.65.52. Nineteen splendid and expensive rooms, $200 to $400.</p>
        <p>Les Templiers, 22 Rue des Templiers; 26.88.55.08, fax 26.47.80.60. Friends recommended this as a good, traditional hotel, but I haven't seen it; 19 rooms from $190 to $280.</p>
        <p>Holiday Inn Garden Court, 46 Rue Buirette; 26.47.56.00, fax 26.47.45.75. Comfortable; 80 rooms from $80.</p>
        <p>EPERNAY : Royal Champagne, (1.5 miles north of Champillon) Route Nationale 2051; 26.52.87.11, fax 26.52.89.69. Rustic charm and every amenity, 27 rooms from $174 to $280.</p>
        <p>Hostellerie La Briqueterie, 4 Route de Sezanne; 26.59.99.99, fax 26.59.92.10. Sprawling country inn with pleasant garden; 40 rooms from $146 to $174.</p>
        <p>Restaurants</p>
        <p>Boyer, the restaurant of Les Crayeres, 64 Boulevard Vasnier, Rheims; 26.82.80.80. Very elegant -- the former estate of the Princess de Polignac -- and very expensive. Specialties include ravioli of lobster and veal sweetbreads and filet of lamb sauteed with truffles. Lunch for two with a modest bottle of wine can easily cost $200 and will not include any of the more than 220 Champagnes on the list. Closed all day Monday and Tuesday for lunch. Annual closing from Dec. 23 to Jan. 13.</p>
        <p>Au Petit Comptoir, 17 Rue de Mars, 51100 Rheims; 26.40.58.58. Gerard Boyer opened this popular spot, then turned it over to Fabrice Maillot, who had worked for him. The menu, which changes every six weeks, shows Mr. Boyer's influence with dishes like terrine of duck liver and artichoke and meringue glacee au fromage blanc. Dinner for two with wine should start at about $100.</p>
        <p>Le Royal Champagne, Route Nationale 2051, 1.5 miles north of Champillon; 26.52.87.11. Another favorite of the Champagne trade, the Royal Champagne offers spectacular views of the vineyards and a well-thought-out but conservative menu. Bresse chicken in a crust of salt is one of the house specialties. Dinner for two with wine will run about $85 to $110 and up.</p>
        <p>Auberge de Relais, Reuilly-Sauvigny (17 miles west of Epernay);  23.70.35.36. A nice, country feel here but with a sophisticated menu. Croustillant of scallops with pine nuts and tomatoes is a house specialty, as are langoustine with a confit of lemon peel. Dinner for two, with wine, from about $140.</p>
        <p>Where it gets that fizz: not from Dom Perignon</p>
        <p>The Benedictine monk Dom Perignon, administrator and cellarmaster at the Abbey of Hautvillers from 1668 to 1715, is wrongly credited with ''inventing'' Champagne by tieing down the corks on his bottles and preserving the fizz.</p>
        <p>In fact, he took every precaution to prevent his wines from fermenting in the bottle and was known in his own time for his skill at wine-making and in selling his wines. He was, apparently, a teetotaler. He can be seen, in effigy, at his desk in the abbey, which is just over the Marne River from Epernay. The ruins of Hautvillers were purchased in 1822 by Comte Pierre-Gabriel Chandon de Brialles, a son in law of Jean-Remy Moet. But it wasn't until 1936, when they established the first luxury brand of Champagne, that Moet &amp; Chandon used the monk's name. They called it, of course, Dom Perignon.</p>
        <p>Actually, the wines of Champagne ''fizzed'' long before Dom Perignon was born. Wine made in the fall, just after the harvest, will continue to ferment until cold weather stops it. Then, in the spring, it begins again.</p>
        <p>Fermentation is the process by which yeast attacks the sugar in the grape juice and turns it into alcohol and carbon dioxide. In the days before wine was bottled, fermentation recommenced harmlessly in the barrels where the wine had lain through the winter. The carbon dioxide escaped into the air.</p>
        <p>When bottling began in the 18th century, restarted fermentation in wine that had been bottled during the winter caused the bottles to explode. Which is why bubbles were the last thing Dom Perignon wanted to see in his bottled wine.</p>
