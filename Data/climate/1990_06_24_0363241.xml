        <p>LEAD: SUSAN MERROW, of Colchester, was recently elected president of the Sierra Club, one of the nation's oldest and largest environmental groups. Founded by John Muir in 1898, the club has grown to 560,000 members from 182,000 in 1981.</p>
        <p>SUSAN MERROW, of Colchester, was recently elected president of the Sierra Club, one of the nation's oldest and largest environmental groups. Founded by John Muir in 1898, the club has grown to 560,000 members from 182,000 in 1981.</p>
        <p>Ms. Merrow, 43 years old, joined the club in 1972 and worked her way up through the ranks until she ran for the board in 1984. She is a part-time lobbyist for the Connecticut Clean Water Coalition and a part-time administrator for Common Cause in Connecticut. She was elected to a one-year term as Sierra Club president in May and will be on the road at least 25 weekends in the coming year, she said, dividing her time between the club's national office in San Francisco and various regional meetings.</p>
        <p>In an interview at the Connecticut Environmental Center in Hartford, Ms. Merrow discussed some of the challenges facing the club. Here are some excerpts from the conversation.</p>
        <p>Q. If we have a cool summer, with no syringes on the beach or oil spills in Alaska, can you maintain the current interest in the environment?</p>
        <p>A. Some of it will wane, but we have anticipated it. Even after the first Earth Day, not all those people stuck around, but some of them did. There are plenty of issues to go around, and a lot of people are going to stick with it.</p>
        <p>Q. The Sierra Club has had a reputation as a club for the upper class. Is that going to continue to be the case?</p>
        <p>A. In the early part of its history, the Sierra Club membership recruitment was largely done person to person, so highly literate hikers recruited highly literate hikers. But at the same time James Watt came along, the Sierra Club and a lot of other not-for-profit organizations got a court ruling that allowed them to mail at a lower bulk rate. So more of our members today are recruited by mail. We don't have a real clear sense of where that's taking us demographically.</p>
        <p>I suspect most Sierra Club people are upper class, fairly well educated. But in the long run, we're waking up to the fact that if we want to be relevant to the 21st century, this cannot continue to be a lily-white organization. So there are discussions going on now about minorities and how to meet the needs of the ethnic communities, to try to accommodate their perspectives and their ideas.</p>
        <p>Q. Was there any moment of environmental epiphany for you?</p>
        <p>A. I spent every summer when I was growing up with my grandmother on the coast of Maine, a little place on the St. George Peninsula. I suppose I had a feeling then, and still have a feeling, there are some special places in the world, some special, natural places, that are almost sacred, they shouldn't be changed, that humans cannot improve on, they can only probably harm.</p>
        <p>So I suppose I was sort of ripe for environmental issues. And then around the first Earth Day in 1970 I became aware of the message that these special places are finite, that species are becoming extinct. I woke up to the fact that we had to do something, although when I first joined I had no notion that I would get personally involved. I thought I would make my yearly donation, and then I got a postcard inviting me to a meeting, and the next meeting I made the cookies, and I kept getting drawn further in. I've always said there's nothing you can't do in the Sierra Club if you never say no.</p>
        <p>Q. What do you hope to accomplish in your one-year term?</p>
        <p>A. One thing that I've been involved with in the last year that is just coming to fruition is that the Sierra Club has been devoting more and more of its resources into state-level lobbying. Most chapters have some presence at their state capitol, but it's been sort of catch as catch can. But the Sierra Club is responding to the idea that if you're going to be a real player, you have to be an insider at the state capitol.</p>
        <p>The action on environmental issues is shifting to the state, and if you can put together environmental victories in a few key legislatures you can roll environmental legislation across the country. As an example, California passed some tough laws on tailpipe emissions, and now the Council of Northeast Governors has passed the same restrictions. We've put about $370,000 into a fund for state-level lobbying.</p>
        <p>Q. When George Bush campaigned, he said he would be the environmental President. Has that happened?</p>
        <p>A. The jury is still seriously out on that. I think he discovered the promises were a lot easier to make than to keep. The first disappointment was the Clean Air Act. It didn't keep his promises, particularly in the area of automobiles. Recently he spoke against helping other countries curb their use of chlorofluorocarbons, which damage the earth's ozone layer, and he's been pretty wishy-washy on global warming. There was a wonderful cartoon around about Earth Day that showed a couple of protesters holding up signs that said ''Save the Earth,'' and someone that looked like George Bush holding up a sign that said, ''Seriously Consider Further Study.'' We wish he would move more decisively.</p>
        <p>Q. With so many states facing an economic slowdown, are environmental initiatives going to suffer?</p>
        <p>A. There are actually a number of things that can be done that have no fiscal impact. Pollution prevention is sort of the wave of the future. After spending years figuring out what to do with toxic and hazardous materials that come out of the end of the pipeline we realize we have to have people go around to the front door of the factory and figure out how to reduce what's going in.</p>
        <p>Q. What was the biggest environmental achievement of the 1990 Connecticut legislature?</p>
        <p>A. The bill that passed that, for the first time, gives us dedicated funds for the environment. The fees raised in that bill will allow the State Department of Environmental Protection to keep 83 positions that would have been cut, but more important it set up a task force that will look at long-term, stable sources of funding for environmental protection.</p>
        <p>The business community, which will pay many of those fees, was actually cautiously cooperative with that bill. In the long run, what the positions are going to do is help get rid of some of the permit backlogs. If you are a business applying for a permit and it takes two years to get it, that's just poor economics.</p>
        <p>Q. What was your biggest disappointment of the session?</p>
        <p>A. We were disappointed that the chlorofluorocarbon bill failed. It was sort of an innocent bystander that became a victim of the Republican budget amendments. They tried to amend their budget onto the bill, as sort of a ploy to get it raised and onto the floor. And it never came back. It was sacrificed to the budget process.</p>
        <p>But other than that it was a fascinating session. We finally got a bill prohibiting sewage dumping from boats. Three years ago that bill started out giving the commissioner authority to prohibit it in sensitive zones, but the regulated community, which is the marinas, wanted those no-discharge zones named.</p>
        <p>So we named eight very specific, highly vulnerable areas where marinas are close to shellfish beds. We fought about that last year, and everyone seemed on board, but at the last minute the bill died.</p>
        <p>This year the bill came along, came through the Judiciary Committee, and finally got to the floor, and legislators who in the past were worried about their marina operators didn't want to go home this year without a no-discharge area in their town. It was amended to include, besides the eight areas, no-discharge areas in Stratford, in New London, along the Connecticut River and so on.</p>
        <p>Q. What can you do to overcome the frustration of people who see it as impossible to individually address overwhelming international environmental problems, like global warming?</p>
        <p>A. The message around Earth Day 20 was, ''you can make a difference.'' You can separate the trash, you can car pool, and that's important even if only to cheer yourself up.</p>
        <p>But the most important thing we have to do, quick, is empower these people in the political process. When I got involved in 1972, it took me until 1976 to discover grass-roots lobbying. We worked on the Bottle Bill in 1976 and 1977, which taught us how to make public policy.</p>
        <p>It took us until 1980 to discover electoral politics. That was the year we worked on the campaign of Mary Mushinsky from Wallingford, who is now the House chairwoman of the Environment Committee. She had a four-way primary, and we learned about phone banking, about door to door, about getting out the vote.</p>
        <p>We can't wait 10 years for the next crop of activists to learn those skills. The 20th anniversary of Earth Day brought us a lot of support. A lot of the born-again environmentalists will drop away, but a lot of the people like Mary Mushinsky and Senator John Atkin from Norwalk and I were the product of the first Earth Day, and a lot of the leaders of tomorrow are in this new crop, and they're here to stay.</p>
        <p>Q. You've got a reputation as being soft spoken. Can you get things done for the environment without being more aggressive?</p>
        <p>A. My job is not to push my compatriots around. My job is not to make the decisions. It's to see good decisions get made. People have to feel they own the agenda, and you don't get that by pushing them around.</p>
        <p>But when we need to, we push around our opponents. I don't get mad easily. Sometimes it takes me until the next day to get mad about something. But there's a place for deliberate thinkers. There are enough people around who get mad quick, but if you take the time to think sometimes you can come up with a solution more people can live with.''  CONNECTICUT Q&amp;A: SUSAN MERROW</p>
