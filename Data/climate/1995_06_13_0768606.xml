        <p>IT was an odd request. The woman, a patient with obsessive-compulsive disorder, was asked to bring two towels from home to a brain imaging laboratory at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. One towel was freshly laundered; the other she had used when she washed her hands after going to the bathroom.</p>
        <p>For the woman, that used towel was an object of horror and dread. If she held it in her hand, it would trigger an overwhelming train of obsessions about contamination and germs, and an almost unbearable urge to wash immediately that if not acted on would set off a state of high anxiety. But despite her loathing, the woman held the soiled towel as she lay still inside the tube of a PET scanner.</p>
        <p>The woman was one of several dozen patients with a range of psychiatric problems who, in the interests of science, have volunteered to have their worst symptoms provoked while images are made of their brains. The goal: to capture an image of the perturbations of their brains while they wrestle with their obsessions and compulsions.</p>
        <p>The approach is adding a new level of detail to psychiatry's understanding of what goes wrong in the brains of patients when symptoms as diverse as post-traumatic stress, obsessions, phobias and delusions have them in their grip.</p>
        <p>"This approach lets us see the brain circuitry that presumably is involved in the symptoms themselves," said Dr. Scott Rauch, a psychiatrist at Harvard University Medical School who conducted the study of the woman with obsessive-compulsive disorder. Dr. Daniel Weinberger, chief of the Clinical Brain Disease Branch at the National Institute of Mental Health in Bethesda, Md., said: "It's a longstanding mystery exactly what systems of the brain are active during psychiatric symptoms. If you take a brain scan of a psychiatric patient who is not having symptoms at the time, you don't know if what you see is related to the disorder. But if you evoke the symptoms, you are much surer that what you see physiologically bears a relationship."</p>
        <p>The scans of patients with symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder showed, for example, increased activity in a series of structures linked to the limbic system, the ancient emotional part of the brain.</p>
        <p>Scientists hope that by establishing the unique brain signatures of psychiatric symptoms they will eventually be able to use imaging methods to bring greater precision to diagnosis and treatment. "One day brain imaging may help sort out which patients would benefit from what treatment," said Dr. Rauch.</p>
        <p>Dr. Rauch directed the study of eight patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder, as well as a study of seven patients with phobias and another eight who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder. His group at Massachusetts General Hospital is one of a handful across the country that are carefully provoking psychiatric symptoms in patients so that brain images can be made.</p>
        <p>The research strategy is very new. The first published report of the approach, Dr. Rauch's study of obsessive-compulsive patients, appeared last year. Last month researchers at the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle published findings in The American Journal of Psychiatry on patients who were hyperventilating during panic attacks.</p>
        <p>While many previous studies have used brain images of patients with psychiatric disorders, little attention has been paid to the patients' mental state at the moment the images were made. Typically, patients have been asked to lie quietly during the procedure, under the assumption that the brain would be in a "neutral" state.</p>
        <p>But as symptoms wax and wane, the images rendered of patients' brains can change drastically. "Simply asking patients to lie quietly fails to control for whether they are happily daydreaming, worried about their taxes or having a panic attack," said Dr. Rauch. "We know now from the wealth of neuroimaging data that the mental state a patient is in is crucial to the image we get."</p>
        <p>In the study of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder, the onset of symptoms was carefully orchestrated with the brain images taken. The woman with the dread of soiled towels, for example, first held the clean towel while she relaxed and inhaled a radioactively tagged form of carbon dioxide, which would highlight her brain activity during the PET scan.</p>
        <p>After a 20-minute break while the radioactive markers decayed, she was handed the dirty towel. When she reported that her obsessions were in full sway, she inhaled the radioactive carbon again and a second image was made. Since the woman was touching a towel during both images, the researchers could differentiate between the brain activity associated with touching something and the brain activity associated with obsessive-compulsive disorder symptoms.</p>
        <p>"By comparing the two scans, you see exactly which parts of the brain are active during the obsessions," said Dr. Michael Jenike, a colleague of Dr. Rauch.</p>
        <p>Psychiatrists met with each of the eight patients in the study to pinpoint exactly how to induce their obsessions during the PET scan. For a man whose obsessions centered on the fear that he might become violent and harm someone, for example, the neutral stimulus was a photograph of his pet dog and the stimulus used to trigger his symptoms was a photo of a serial killer. For another person, the neutral stimulus was a clean dollar bill, and a dollar bill that the patient thought had been used to buy drugs was used to provoke his obsessions about contamination.</p>
        <p>During the patients' symptoms, the PET scans showed heightened activity in the paralimbic belt, structures linked to the limbic system, the ancient emotional part of the brain. Most active were the insular cortex, a region enfolded deep within the cortex; the posterior orbitofrontal cortex, which lies behind the forehead; the anterior cingulate cortex, which is above and behind the orbitofrontal zone, and the anterior temporal cortex, just in front of the ears.</p>
        <p>Because these structures are central sites for anxiety, they are sometimes called the "worry circuit." Many or most of these areas, Dr. Rauch's research shows, have heightened activity during symptoms of any anxiety disorder, whether panic attacks, obsessive-compulsive disorder or phobias. Another area that is active during symptoms of these disorders is the locus ceruleus, part of the brain stem that rouses the body to action by secreting norepinephrine, a brain chemical released when a person is under stress. Dr. Rauch will report these findings in Paris this month at the First International Conference on Functional Mapping of the Human Brain.</p>
        <p>In addition to the worry circuit activity, Dr. Rauch has found increased activity in the language and visual areas of the cortex. This activity seems related to how patients experience their obsessions, "seeing with the mind's eye or hearing the mind's voice," said Dr. Rauch.</p>
        <p>For a study of simple phobias, Dr. Rauch and his team recruited patients who were terrified of small animals like snakes, rats and tarantulas. In individual consultations, the researchers determined exactly how close each patient could tolerate having the animal placed, so that the patient would be overwhelmed by anxiety and yet could still lie quietly in the brain scanner.</p>
        <p>Some patients could tolerate having their hands resting on a plastic box containing the animal. But Dr. Rauch said, "One patient couldn't stand to have it closer than in the adjoining room."</p>
        <p>As with the obsessive-compulsive patients, while the feared animals were close by, the most brain activity was in the paralimbic region, especially the anterior temporal cortex and insular cortex, which are associated with a racing heartbeat and escalating blood pressure during anxiety episodes.</p>
        <p>There was also increased activity in the tactile cortex, which processes sensations of touch. "When they described their fears," said Dr. Rauch, "the focus was on imagining the feeling of the animal rubbing against them. This was reflected in the heightened activation in the cortical center for the sense of touch, even though they were not actually touching the animals."</p>
        <p>In a study of patients with post-traumatic stress disorder, Dr. Rauch and his colleagues conferred with volunteers to write vivid, detailed narratives of the traumatic events that caused the symptoms. A firefighter, for example, helped compose a script based on his experience recovering the charred remains of bodies. These narratives were read to the patients to trigger their trauma symptoms while PET scans were made. For comparison, the patients also wrote narratives that invoked a neutral scene.</p>
        <p>Again, while the patients were experiencing symptoms the paralimbic belt showed heightened activity, but mainly in the right hemisphere, which is thought to be active during distressing emotions. Another particularly active structure was the amygdala, an almond-shaped limbic structure at ear level, which is a repository for emotionally charged memories.</p>
        <p>The involvement of the amygdala in post-traumatic stress makes sense, said Dr. Rauch, because "P.T.S.D. is the vivid evocation of a painful, haunting memory. P.T.S.D. victims will tell you that it's not just a memory -- during their episodes they feel as though the events were actually recurring all over again."</p>
        <p>For many post-traumatic stress patients, that replay is through strong visual images, and Dr. Rauch found heightened activity in the patients' visual cortexes.</p>
        <p>Another effect of the trauma was that the language areas of the cortex "turned off," said Dr. Rauch. This, he added, makes sense of a common phenomenon in the disorder in which "patients have difficulty putting words to these emotions, and so have trouble dealing with these experiences."</p>
        <p>Other researchers are triggering just a single symptom, hyperventilation, in patients with panic disorder. Researchers asked one group of patients being treated for panic attacks and another group without the disorder to make themselves hyperventilate by breathing rapidly and deeply while images were made of their brains.</p>
        <p>"The people with panic disorder, compared to people without the disorder, had a unique brain metabolic response to the hyperventilation," said Dr. Stephen Dager, a psychiatrist at the University of Washington Medical School in Seattle. "We found a perturbation in the insular cortex." He is undertaking further studies to see if other brain regions are especially active during hyperventilation in people with panic disorder.</p>
        <p>Dr. John Hsiao, a psychiatrist at the National Institute of Mental Health, has done preliminary brain imaging studies on schizophrenia patients who were taken off clozapine, a medication that had suppressed their psychotic symptoms. "The patients had the full range of schizophrenic symptoms," said Dr. Hsiao. "Some were delusional, some were having auditory hallucinations, though we don't know exactly how acute they were during the scan."</p>
        <p>Among the brain areas showing unusual activity while the patients were having symptoms were the medial temporal cortex, which includes limbic structures like the hippocampus and amygdala, as well as the thalamus, the brain's central relay station for sensory data, emotions, movement, thinking and planning. Work by Dr. Nancy Andreasen at the University of Iowa in Iowa City has found structural abnormalities in the thalamus in some patients with schizophrenia.</p>
        <p>One of the more distinctive symptoms of schizophrenia, hallucinatory "voices," may be related to activity in a language area, the anterior frontal gyrus. When the patients went back on clozapine, which silenced the voices they heard, brains scans showed that "there was a reversal of the activity" seen in the language area without the medication, said Dr. Hsiao.
