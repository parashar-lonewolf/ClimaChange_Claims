        <p>JUST as India and the West had begun to put past frictions behind them, global warming has come along to reignite the sort of passions that were commonplace during the cold war, when India's perspectives were those of an ally of the Soviet Union and a founder of what was known as the non-aligned movement, with its fixation on the evils done to developing nations by the rapacious West.</p>
        <p>In the months leading up to the United Nations conference on climate change in Kyoto, Japan, Indian environmentalists and politicians have joined in a chorus of angry denunciations of proposals that Western nations, particularly the United States, have advanced for limiting emissions of so-called greenhouse gases. Phrases like ''environmental colonialism'' and the ''Western rape and pillage of the world's resources'' have  poured forth, along with predictions that Kyoto could forge a new and even deeper split between the richer and poorer nations of the earth.</p>

        <p>JUST as India and the West had begun to put past frictions behind them, global warming has come along to reignite the sort of passions that were commonplace during the cold war, when India's perspectives were those of an ally of the Soviet Union and a founder of what was known as the non-aligned movement, with its fixation on the evils done to developing nations by the rapacious West.</p>
        <p>In the months leading up to the United Nations conference on climate change in Kyoto, Japan, Indian environmentalists and politicians have joined in a chorus of angry denunciations of proposals that Western nations, particularly the United States, have advanced for limiting emissions of so-called greenhouse gases. Phrases like ''environmental colonialism'' and the ''Western rape and pillage of the world's resources'' have  poured forth, along with predictions that Kyoto could forge a new and even deeper split between the richer and poorer nations of the earth.</p>
        <p>At one level, the Indian anger seems curiously misplaced, considering the acknowledged deterioration of India's own environment and the blame that many of these same environmentalists and politicians place on governmental failures at home. If India's environment is visibly among the most polluted anywhere, particularly in terms of air quality in the major cities, it is a problem closely linked to a burgeoning population, now nearly 980 million, that has almost tripled in the 50 years since independence and continues to grow by 20 million every year with scant sign of any government effort to promote birth control.</p>
        <p>As anybody struggling with the choking levels of air pollution in New Delhi, Bombay or Calcutta can attest, India is fighting a losing battle with urban traffic levels that double every five years, Dickensian factories that generally ignore environmental controls and the reliance in heavy industry on heavily sulfurous coal. The situation in New Delhi, the capital, has become so threatening that some Western embassies have begun discouraging the assignment to India of any diplomat or family member with respiratory problems, especially small children. Indian experts have even warned that rising sea levels could cost the country large portions of its 3,000-mile coastline within the next 50 years.</p>
        <p>But when it comes to international efforts to deal with global warming, many of those who will have a decisive voice in India's policies approach the issue as though environmental degradation is mainly the fault of, and a problem for, the industrialized nations of the West. If there were any doubt of the strength of feeling on the matter, it was dispelled when Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral attended the meeting in Edinburgh in October of the nations of the Commonwealth and agreed to a closing communique that said, seemingly innocuously, that all countries attending the Kyoto meeting ''will need to play their part in policies that would result in significant reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gujral was met with a barrage of criticism at home to the effect that he had sold out India and other developing nations with large greenhouse gas emissions, China and Brazil prominent among them. Those nations have said that it is up to the United States and other Western nations to cut back on emissions without imposing similar requirements on poorer countries that are struggling to catch up economically with the West. This position has been squarely rejected by President Clinton, who announced in September that the United States ''will not assume binding obligations unless key developing nations meaningfully participate in the effort.''</p>
        <p>Indians marshal numerous arguments against their country's accepting any mandatory emissions controls. Many are rooted in political arguments that depict the ''one-worldism'' of Western environmentalists as a mask for efforts to shackle the economic development of poorer nations just as they show signs of beginning to claim a greater share of the world's wealth.</p>
        <p>Even among Indian environmentalists who accept the need for limits, there is a common political premise: that whatever environmental regime emerges from Kyoto should be based on ''per capita entitlements'' to pollute the atmosphere, an approach that would ultimately allow India and China, with nearly two-fifths of the world's population, to pump more carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere than the United States, Canada and all the nations of the European Union combined.</p>
