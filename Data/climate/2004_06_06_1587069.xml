        <p>(Editors' choices of other recent books of particular interest)</p>
        <p>SONTAG &amp; KAEL: Opposites Attract Me, by Craig Seligman. (Counterpoint, $23.) An eager, confiding book, by an experienced writer and editor, about two widely discussed and influential critical icons who arose at the same historical moment (mid-1960's). They come to represent a quarrel, never explicit, between attitudes that Kael might call solemnity and that Sontag might call frivolity.</p>
        <p>BIRTH OF THE CHESS QUEEN: A History, by Marilyn Yalom. (HarperCollins, $24.95.) A wide-ranging exploration of the origins of chess and of its most powerful piece, the queen. Chess was once queenless, and Yalom attributes the queen's arrival and empowerment to the rising status in medieval Europe of women like Toda of Navarre, Blanche of Castile and Eleanor of Aquitaine.</p>
        <p>TRANSMISSION, by Hari Kunzru. (Dutton, $24.95.) A fast-paced up-to-date British novel whose protagonist, a shy young computer programmer in India, moves to America, where he finds the demand for his services far less than he had supposed; thwarted at work (and in love also), he launches a killer computer virus in the hope of becoming a hero by ultimately stopping it. Rotten idea.</p>
        <p>THE CREATION OF THE MEDIA: Political Origins of Modern Communications, by Paul Starr. (Basic Books, $27.50.) A scholar's cautious, detailed, convincing account of the deliberate framing of information carriers, from cheap postage to privatized electronics (telegraph, telephone, radio) to saturation by movies, networks and magazines.</p>
        <p>SIR JOHN GIELGUD: A Life in Letters, edited by Richard Mangan. (Arcade, $30.) What could they be but delightful, these 900-odd letters, dated from 1912 to 1999, by an actor celebrated for his candor who took his art seriously indeed without letting it inhibit observation, gossip, snobbery and affection.</p>
        <p>RED SKY AT MORNING: America and the Crisis of the Global Environment, by James Gustave Speth. (Yale University, $24.) A profoundly sobering study, by an environmental adviser to Presidents Carter and Clinton, of the nation's failure to address the probability of global warming both in the past, when there might have been time, and now, when there may not.</p>
        <p>PORT MUNGO, by Patrick McGrath. (Knopf, $24.) This immensely clever, tautly composed novel concerns a Gauguinistic artist who flees the suffocating confines of London for New York, then Havana, then Port Mungo, at the end of world and mind, where his genius flourishes. Unless it doesn't, since we learn that the narrator of all this is quite unreliable and full of hidden purpose.</p>
        <p>YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL IN THE LAND OF THE FREE, by James Kelman. (Harcourt, $25.) Jeremiah Brown, Kelman's hero in this novel, is a down-and-outer, authority hater and epic drinkist. Brought up Glaswegian, he has lived in the United States for 12 years and acquired the analytical powers that make this paranoid performance, set mainly in bars, a brilliant gloss on the political and social reverberations of 9/11 in this country.</p>
