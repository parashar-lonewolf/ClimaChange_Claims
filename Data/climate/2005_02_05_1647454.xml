        <p>Honda Motor urged the federal government on Friday to impose tougher fuel- economy regulations, an unheard- of request from an automaker.</p>
        <p>The request was meant as a gesture to environmental groups after the Thursday decision by Honda and Nissan to join an industry lawsuit against California, which is seeking to regulate the emissions from cars and trucks of gases that are said to worsen global warming. Most other automakers have already sued the state to block what would be the first such effort in the nation.</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Honda Motor urged the federal government on Friday to impose tougher fuel- economy regulations, an unheard- of request from an automaker.</p>
        <p>The request was meant as a gesture to environmental groups after the Thursday decision by Honda and Nissan to join an industry lawsuit against California, which is seeking to regulate the emissions from cars and trucks of gases that are said to worsen global warming. Most other automakers have already sued the state to block what would be the first such effort in the nation.</p>
        <p>''Honda is taking one step forward and one step back,'' said Daniel Becker, the top global warming strategist at the Sierra Club. ''They are recognizing the need for cleaner cars, but it is unfortunate they are joining the retrograde caucus of automakers in opposing California's effort to require cleaner cars.''</p>
        <p>Honda has long been the most independent automaker on environmental policy and has not joined Toyota and the Big Three domestic automakers in many lobbying efforts against tougher fuel economy rules. But several environmentalists who follow the industry said they could not recall any company actually asking to tighten fuel economy regulations.</p>
        <p>Honda officials would not say how much of a gas mileage increase they would support. They said that they made the statement to show they did support regulating greenhouse gas emissions, which are closely tied to fuel consumption, while they also object to action being taken by states.</p>
        <p>''We are not seeking to block greenhouse gas standards,'' said Ed Cohen, Honda's vice president for governmental affairs. ''We simply are wanting to be sure it's addressed in the correct forum.''</p>
