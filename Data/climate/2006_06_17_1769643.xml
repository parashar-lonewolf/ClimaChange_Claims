        <p>In what was once the capital of the Mississippi petroleum business, the new oil boom is hidden in plain sight.</p>
        <p>There is a drilling platform behind the Shoney's 24-hour restaurant. Just blocks from City Hall, a rig natters loudly, tended by four roughnecks. Across the road from the country club, nearly a dozen tall blue pumps nod like a council of sleepy elders.</p>
        <p>The high price of oil, hovering around $70 a barrel, has brought a nearly dormant Mississippi petroleum industry roaring to life. Wells abandoned long ago by the major oil companies are being reopened by independent operators. Requests for new drilling permits have spiked. Trainees for oil-field work can make nearly $14 an hour. Companies wait 12 months to rent the kind of field equipment that was once sold for scrap.</p>
        <p>Five years ago there were some 20 functioning oil wells inside the city limits of Laurel; now there are 83.</p>
        <p>But many people here have barely noticed, perhaps because they have lived for decades amid the industrial furniture of the oil patch. Or perhaps because, unlike the boom of the 1970's and 80's, this one has not brought private jets, $1,200 bar tabs, high-stakes craps games or trips out to the Capri Club, an establishment of ill repute where oilmen had corporate accounts. Oil is back, but without the old trappings.</p>
        <p>''It's all sort of moderate,'' said Melvin Mack, the mayor of this city of 18,000 -- grown to 24,000 with evacuees from Hurricane Katrina -- in southeastern Mississippi. ''You don't have all the beer drinking, the gin drinking, that they say goes along with an oil boom.''</p>
        <p>Gone is the Oil Well Lounge, with its bar the length of a city block and waitresses in short skirts and fishnet stockings. In its place is North of the Border Texmex and Cantina, with its steam-table buffet and $1 margaritas.</p>
        <p>Angie Clark, the bartender, looked blank when asked about Laurel's oil wells, one of which was just about directly across the street. ''No, I don't know about them,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Nor had she ever heard of the Oil Well Lounge, though her smattering of late-afternoon customers remembered it reverently: the live bands, the bookmakers, the expense accounts.</p>
        <p>''If you were broke, you just looked on the floor and picked up a hundred dollar bill,'' said Paul Swartzfager Jr., a Laurel lawyer. ''They were throwing money around that crazy.''</p>
        <p>That was a time before the aging of the work force, the strict policing of drunken drivers and the rising influence of Bible Belt social mores. It was also back when the major oil companies had a presence here. But because Mississippi's reserves were small, its wells slow-flowing, the majors sold out to independents years ago.</p>
        <p>When the price of oil goes high enough, those marginal wells, as they are called, become profitable again. By pumping Mississippi's naturally occurring carbon dioxide reserves into old wells, a process that helps free oil from the ground, one company, Denbury Resources, is expecting to leach 80 million barrels from the state's aging fields.</p>
        <p>''The oil we're going after is oil that we left behind,'' said Gary Wray, an independent operator who is pouring all his available capital into reopening the old wells he amassed during lean times. This is the moment Mr. Wray and others like him have spent years waiting for. ''There's no young people in this business,'' he said. ''I'm 54, and I'm one of the youngest people in our business in the state.''</p>
        <p>Jim Moss, the owner of an oil-field services company in Laurel, scoffed when the comeback was referred to as an oil boom.</p>
        <p>''The real boom was in the 50's, 60's and 70's,'' Mr. Moss said, even as he acknowledged that he was raking in more money than ever. So are the truck drivers, roustabouts, drillers and electricians. Some have come out of retirement. Others have returned to the business from different pursuits.</p>
        <p>An experienced oil-field worker here can make as much as $22 an hour -- exceptional pay for this part of the country -- and a crew boss perhaps $80,000 a year.</p>
        <p>And still employers are begging for people.</p>
        <p>The labor shortage provokes nostalgia among those who started out as roughnecks and worked their way up. Well work is hard physical labor, involving picks and shovels and plenty of sticky black dirt. Though the pay is good and the jobs come with benefits, ''most of them don't like to get dirty,'' said John Porter, a crew pusher who has been in the business 30 years.</p>
        <p>Jerry Huddleston, who runs drilling operations inside Laurel's city limits for Comstock Resources, said people of his generation had grown up working. ''I did -- I worked on a farm,'' Mr. Huddleston said. ''Used to be you hired 10 people, 9 of them were going to be with you for a while.''</p>
        <p>When men were out on the platform, they talked only about women, recalled Dan C. Taylor, who put himself through law school working summers on a rig. But when they were off duty, they talked only about rigs and wells.</p>
        <p>Julius W. King, 83, an oil-field investor in a powder blue sports coat with a United Way lapel pin, lamented social welfare programs that he said provided a disincentive to work. ''The government gives everybody some money now,'' he said. ''They write you a check.''</p>
        <p>Mr. King grew up in nearby Heidelberg, where oil was discovered in 1943 and where the high school still has two wells on its grounds. ''A dirt-poor whistle-stop in the red clay hills of eastern Mississippi was the proud owner of the biggest gusher east of the Mississippi,'' Mr. King said, quoting as best he remembered from a Time magazine article about his hometown.</p>
        <p>Mr. King was unfamiliar, though, with the new labor problems in the field. ''So the young guys aren't coming?'' he asked.</p>
        <p>Eddie Helms, the local manager of a company that provides casing to line wells, blamed crystal meth.</p>
        <p>''It's killing us,'' Mr. Helms said. ''We're a drug-free company. I tested eight people, and six of them failed.''</p>
        <p>Another reason for the shortage is competition from outside the industry. Hurricane Katrina has created thousands of construction and cleanup jobs in the state. Paul Broom, 47, who recently doubled his pay by returning to the petroleum business from a job driving propane trucks, said his 21-year-old son had left the oil fields to take a cleanup job.</p>
        <p>Yet another reason labor is scarce may be self-preservation. The business is much safer than it once was, but an old saying -- nothing on an oil field will hurt you, it'll kill you -- can still hold true. The company that Mr. Broom's son had left lost three men in an explosion this month at a well that was being reopened in Raleigh, about 30 miles northwest of Laurel. The men were 18, 23 and 53. The lone survivor was 72.</p>
