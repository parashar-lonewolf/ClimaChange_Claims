        <p>The leaders of the eight countries that together represent about half of the world's economic activity called today for rapid democratic elections in Hong Kong, renewed energy to break the stalemate in the Middle East, a new commitment to peace in Bosnia, and new aid for Africa.</p>
        <p>But in a sharp dispute with France and other European nations that dominated this morning's final session of ''The Summit of the Eight,'' President Clinton refused to commit the United States to a specific reduction in the emission of carbon dioxide and the other greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming, agreeing only to ''substantial reductions'' by 2010.</p>

        <p>The leaders of the eight countries that together represent about half of the world's economic activity called today for rapid democratic elections in Hong Kong, renewed energy to break the stalemate in the Middle East, a new commitment to peace in Bosnia, and new aid for Africa.</p>
        <p>But in a sharp dispute with France and other European nations that dominated this morning's final session of ''The Summit of the Eight,'' President Clinton refused to commit the United States to a specific reduction in the emission of carbon dioxide and the other greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming, agreeing only to ''substantial reductions'' by 2010.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton also acknowledged, in his closing news conference, that he had failed to resolve differences with France and Italy over how many countries should be invited to join NATO in the first round of expansion, with the Madrid summit meeting of the Atlantic alliance less than six weeks away.</p>
        <p>While all 16 NATO countries agree that Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic should be invited to join in Madrid, the United States has flatly rejected French and Italian arguments that Romania and Slovenia should also come in now.</p>
        <p>Other countries also favor the admission of Slovenia, but Mr. Clinton  said an initial NATO expansion is best limited to those countries that are ''most qualified'' to enter, while leaving the door open to further expansions later.</p>
        <p>Referring to Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, Mr. Clinton's national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, said today that ''there is a consensus around the three, but there is not a consensus around the others,'' and that invitations would go to those countries where there was consensus.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Clinton hoped to reach agreement before the Madrid meeting, Mr. Berger noted that the new  Prime Minister of Britain, Tony Blair, now supports the American position.</p>
        <p>In his news conference, Mr. Clinton also defended his policies toward China and the Middle East. He called for the House of Representatives, in a vote expected this week, to support his extension of a normal trading status with China, arguing that ''we shouldn't assume bad faith on the part of the Chinese'' in their commitment to provide Hong Kong ''a high degree of autonomy.''</p>
        <p>Still, over Chinese objections, the group of eight countries here -- Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United States and Russia -- urged Beijing to guarantee Hong Kong's ''fundamental freedoms and the rule of law,'' its independent economic and monetary system, and to hold ''democratic elections'' for a new legislature ''as soon as possible.''</p>
        <p>The final communique, in its section on the Middle East, also implicitly criticized Washington. ''The peace process faces a crisis, and we are determined to re-inject momentum into it,'' the document said. But Mr. Clinton rejected calls from President Jacques Chirac of France and other leaders to get more visibly involved in pushing the Israelis and Palestinians back to the negotiating table.</p>
        <p>A senior American official said today that the refusal of Mr. Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright to go to the Middle East showed courage. ''The tough choice she and the President are making is to sit tight and wait for the parties to realize that they must take the steps necessary to get the process back on track.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton noted that the Middle East is at ''a pivotal moment'' and added: ''You should never believe that just because you don't see high-level air transport between Washington and the Middle East that nothing is going on from our point of view. I spend quite a bit of time on this every week.''</p>
        <p>And he repeated his position that to restore confidence, the Palestinans must ''express clear opposition to terrorism'' and commitment to the peace effort, while the Israelis ''need to show in specific ways'' that they are committed to the existing Oslo peace accords and will not try to undermine them unilaterally.</p>
        <p>The summit meeting was notable for its inclusion of Russia as a full member in all sessions except a one-hour monetary meeting on Saturday, and Mr. Clinton again praised Russia's President, Boris N. Yeltsin, and the Russian people today for pursuing a path toward democracy, market development and integration with the West.</p>
        <p>Mr. Yeltsin, who underwent heart surgery last year, skipped last night's boisterous entertainment because of fatigue. He did meet with Mr. Chirac today and participated in the closing sessions, although he appeared grimmer and more pasty.</p>
        <p>Ms. Albright spent some of her time here exploring how the former Khmer Rouge leader, Pol Pot, might be brought to international justice for the genocidal crimes his government committed in Cambodia from 1975 to 1979, officials said. Mr. Clinton said that ''there probably should be an international war crimes tribunal'' that is permanent.</p>
        <p>But the main topic of contention was the environment and greenhouse gases, with Mr. Chirac, described by American officials as ''prickly and aggressive,'' pushing hard for a specific American commitment to match Europe's. The European Union agreed last week to cut its emissions of greenhouse gases to 15 percent of its 1990 levels by 2010.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton refused to commit to a specific figure here, though Washington is supposed to do so in six months at an international conference on the issue in Kyoto, Japan. American officials say the European demands are ''unreasonable'' and do not reflect American conditions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chirac, in his news conference, shrugged and said: ''Americans are major polluters. The average American is responsible for emitting three times the amount of greenhouse gas as the average Frenchman.'' But Mr. Chirac said that European unity had at least pushed the Americans to agree on 2010 for ''substantial reductions,'' if not yet on a percentage.</p>
        <p>On Bosnia, Mr. Clinton said he was pleased that the nations here agreed on pursuing all aspects of the Dayton accords, including the return of refugees, freedom of movement for all ethnic groups and the punishment of war criminals. They also agreed that aid to the parties should be conditional on their fulfillment of those promises.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton also repeated his position that the current military mission in Bosnia should be over in July 1998. European officials like Mr. Blair have said they believe that Bosnia will still require an international military presence after July 1998, but Clinton officials still say they ''fully expect'' that American soliders will leave then.</p>
        <p>The communique pleased the Americans by calling for a fairer reassessment of United Nations dues and supported Mr. Clinton's initiative to help African countries by opening markets and reducing duties. But the Europeans also insisted that market access and capitalism could not replace direct aid, and the French and Japanese agreed to work together on their own aid and investment initiative in Africa.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chirac said he was glad Washington was now thinking about Africa, while Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, speaking sarcastically, said he welcomed ''America's discovery of Africa.''</p>
