        <p>Senator Byron L. Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota, has raised pointed and repeated objections to the way Republicans met behind closed doors to assemble the wide-ranging energy measure that was easily approved by the House on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Now Mr. Dorgan and some of his Democratic colleagues in the Senate are getting behind the bill, calling its provisions for energy efficiency and greater use of corn-based ethanol a step in the right direction. In Mr. Dorgan's case, the pot was also sweetened by a last-minute addition of loan guarantees for a coal-burning power plant that, under the legislation, is to ''be located in the Upper Great Plains.''</p>
        <p>''I am pleased that it is in there, but that is not what tips the balance for me,'' said Mr. Dorgan of the power-plant provision that he and authors of the measure said was directed toward North Dakota.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dorgan's endorsement illustrates both the sway of home-state projects and the difficulties that opponents of the legislation face in their uphill fight to derail it in the Senate after the solid House vote of 246 to 180 to approve the measure, with 46 Democrats joining 200 Republicans in support.</p>
        <p>The bill is the first major energy legislation in a decade and touches on most facets of American power generation and consumption. It seeks to encourage greater domestic oil and gas production, promotes the construction of new coal and nuclear power plants, provides tax breaks for fuel efficiency and takes steps to encourage stability and greater investment in the electric grid.</p>
        <p>Lawmakers and lobbying groups opposing the bill say that many members of the House and Senate have serious reservations about elements of the proposal but that those are often outweighed by the abundance of pet projects, subsidies and tax breaks spread throughout the measure, which is more than 1,000 pages long. The Congressional generosity has swollen the cost of the tax breaks to an estimated $25.7 billion, more than three times what the Bush administration initially advocated.</p>
        <p>''Everybody is looking at it from the perspective of what is in it for them while this policy is moving us backwards,'' said Debbie Boger, a senior representative for the Sierra Club.</p>
        <p>The extent of the federal largesse is no accident. The authors cast a wide net to round up votes for legislation that they knew would contain elements many lawmakers would find objectionable. So they made sure some major inducements were incorporated, particularly the initiative to double the demand for corn-based ethanol, a provision that most farm-state lawmakers will find it difficult to vote against.</p>
        <p>''We have produced a bill that is tough to walk away from,'' said Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico and the lead Senate energy negotiator.</p>
        <p>The cost is causing the administration to wince, but the White House is backing it, saying the cost is the price of getting a bill President Bush has clamored for since his first days in office. ''Even though it went beyond the scope of what we proposed, we think the other assets and benefits make it a strong bill,'' said Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham.</p>
        <p>Despite objections by some leading Democrats, the House passed it with votes to spare as supporters said it would aid the economy, increase production of fossil fuels and expand use of wind, solar and geothermal energy.</p>
        <p>But Democrats on the energy committee attacked it, saying it was a regressive exercise in corporate welfare that let some polluters off the hook.</p>
        <p>Approval by the House, where the Republican leadership exerts tight control, was always expected. But in the closely divided Senate, a few Democrats and Republicans were threatening to filibuster the measure over the provision protecting producers of the gasoline additive MTBE from product defect lawsuits that have been filed in New York, California, New Hampshire and elsewhere.</p>
        <p>But whether the critics can muster the 40 votes needed to block the legislation is unclear.</p>
        <p>The filibuster would most likely need the support of the Senate Democratic leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota. But he is a main advocate of the plan to increase the use of ethanol and on Tuesday said he had not decided what to do.</p>
        <p>Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota, said that the measure was finding wide support among farm and energy advocates in his home state and that he would join Mr. Dorgan in backing it.</p>
        <p>Analysts both in and out of Congress continued to sift through the measure to pinpoint more subsidies, tax breaks and benefits to certain industries. An analysis by the Senate Democratic staff disclosed several, including a series of loan guarantees for coal plants in Alaska, Louisiana, Minnesota and West Virginia, with no limit on potential federal liability. The bill also allows $12 million to be spent on centers at the University of Mississippi and the University of Oklahoma for research on ethanol.</p>
        <p>Taxpayers for Common Sense identified a host of home-state projects, including four federally backed ''greenbond'' proposals that would help build tourism, shopping and entertainment centers in Syracuse; Shreveport, La.; Lakewood, Colo.; and Atlanta.</p>
