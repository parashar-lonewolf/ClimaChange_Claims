        <p>The General Motors Corporation agreed today to recall nearly a half-million late-model Cadillacs and pay nearly $45 million in fines and other costs, settling a Federal complaint that the automaker had installed devices that caused the cars to emit illegal amounts of carbon monoxide.</p>
        <p>The company agreed to pay $11 million in fines and spend about $30 million on recalling and repairing the cars and about $4 million on compensatory programs to help control air pollution, senior officials of the Environmental Protection  Agency and the Justice Department said.</p>

        <p>The General Motors Corporation agreed today to recall nearly a half-million late-model Cadillacs and pay nearly $45 million in fines and other costs, settling a Federal complaint that the automaker had installed devices that caused the cars to emit illegal amounts of carbon monoxide.</p>
        <p>The company agreed to pay $11 million in fines and spend about $30 million on recalling and repairing the cars and about $4 million on compensatory programs to help control air pollution, senior officials of the Environmental Protection  Agency and the Justice Department said.</p>
        <p>Government lawyers said they believed that the company knew the design change would cause pollution problems, an assertion the company denied.</p>
        <p>In a statement, General Motors called the case "a matter of interpretation" of complex regulations, but said it had "worked extremely hard to resolve the matter and avoid litigation."</p>
        <p>The civil penalty of $11 million is the third largest ever assessed in a pollution case, the second largest in a case under the Clean Air Act, and the largest involving pollution from motor vehicles, the officials of the environmental agency and Justice Department said.</p>
        <p>The settlement, if approved by the Federal District Court in Washington, D.C., where it was filed today, would be the first time a court has ordered a recall of automobiles in order to curb pollution, rather than to improve safety  or dependability.</p>
        <p>According to the Government agencies, G.M. in 1990 designed a new computer chip for the engine controls on 1991 Cadillac Seville and DeVille models, after  customers complained that the cars had a tendency to stall when the system that  operates heating and air conditioning was running.</p>
        <p>The new chips were programmed to inject more fuel into the engine whenever this climate control system was in operation. But the resulting exhaust was too  rich in carbon monoxide for the cars' catalytic converters to clean, and the tailpipe emissions rose to double or triple allowable levels, the officials said.</p>
        <p>The cars are typically driven with climate control on, but, like other cars,  when they are certified at the factory as meeting the pollution control standards, they are tested with the systems off. Therefore, the Cadillacs' high  pollution levels would not register in those tests, the officials said.</p>
        <p>Under the Clean Air Act, the officials said, G.M. should have informed the agency that it had changed the car's design in a way that resulted in pollution  violations during normal driving. The agency directed automakers in the 1970's not to take advantage of the testing rules to design cars that would cause unnecessary pollution, and G.M.'s competitors obeyed, the officials said.</p>
        <p>"G.M.'s actions constituted a serious violation of the Clean Air Act and undermined E.P.A's efforts to improve air quality," said Steven Herman, assistant administrator of enforcement at the environmental agency. "Since the vehicle certifica-tion program depends on complete and accurate information supplied by automobile manufacturers, G.M.'s conduct jeopardized the integrity of the program."</p>
        <p>The settlement was announced at the Justice Department by Attorney General Janet Reno, emphasizing the importance that the Administration placed on it.</p>
        <p>The E.P.A. Administrator, Carol M. Browner, said it was exactly the kind of case that would be hampered by proposed cuts in the agency's spending on enforcement.</p>
        <p>Carbon monoxide is one of the six main air pollutants governed by the health-based standards of the Clean Air Act. It can contribute to heart and lung ailments.</p>
        <p>Betsy Hemming, a G.M. spokeswoman, said there was no reason for the company ever to have tested emissions with the car's climate control operating.</p>
        <p>"It was not in the rules, not in the regulations; it's not in the Clean Air Act," Ms. Hemming said.</p>
        <p>But Lois J. Schiffer, assistant attorney general for environment, said: "We think G.M. knew what it was doing."</p>
        <p>Thomas P. Carroll, a Justice Department environmental lawyer, was particularly critical of General Motors for continuing to build the chip into the 1992, 1993, 1994 and 1995 Cadillacs after discovering the problem in 1991.</p>
        <p>"They should have gone back and re-engineered it to improve the emissions," Mr. Carroll said.</p>
        <p>He said three separate violations of law took place: the cars were equipped with a device that overwhelmed the emissions control system, the devices were not identified in descriptions of the vehicles provided to the Environmental Protection Agency, and with the installation of the computer chips at repair shops, the cars from the 1991 model year were tampered with after their sale to  reduce their compliance with emissions standards.</p>
        <p>The pollution was detected during testing for research purposes by the E.P.A.</p>
        <p>The company agreed today to recall and fix more than 470,000 Cadillacs -- those built from 1991 to 1995 with a 4.9 liter engine that is no longer produced. The company said it had designed a way to control the original stalling problem without increasing pollution.</p>
        <p>The recall is expected to cost the company about $30 million. The corrective  measures involve "new fueling calibrations," the company said, which will meet expected future emissions standards and "should have no adverse effect on the driveability of the vehicles involved."</p>
        <p>The action is relatively modest compared with earlier recalls, including one  involving eight million G.M. vehicles to deal with possible engine block problems.</p>
        <p>Besides the civil penalty, the company also agreed to carry out remedial projects like paying to replace school buses with cleaner models or buying older cars and junking them. The only bigger civil penalty under the Clean Air Act was the $11.1 million levied against the Louisiana-Pacific Corporation in 1993 for air pollution violations at its wood-products plants.</p>
        <p>The Texas Eastern Natural Gas Pipeline Company in 1987 paid a $15 million penalty for violating Federal toxic and hazardous-waste laws.</p>
        <p>Because of another editing error, the article referred inaccurately in some  editions to the pollutant involved. It is carbon monoxide, not carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>Correction:  December 2, 1995, Saturday</p>
        <p>Because of an editing error, a front-page article yesterday about a Federal pollution complaint against the General Motors Corporation misstated the formula for the $45 million settlement. The company is to pay an $11 million civil fine. It will also spend $8.75 million on compensatory programs to reduce air pollution from other sources, a figure that could vary depending on the effectiveness of the company's recall of about 470,000 cars. The remaining cost, estimated to be at least $25 million, is for recalling the cars and repairing the problem.</p>
