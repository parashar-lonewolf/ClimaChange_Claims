        <p>A little more than a decade ago, George W. Bush's father played a decisive role in uniting Germany. On Thursday, the president will come face to face with the consequences of that act as he meets a buoyant German chancellor carrying firm, sometimes confrontational, messages from Europe.</p>
        <p>Gone is the Germany that existed during the cold war, sovereign in name but rather less so in reality.  Gone is the Germany that knew its interests but seldom dared speak them aloud. In their place is a more confident, assertive nation whose new ambitions Chancellor Gerhard Schröder has come to embody.</p>
        <p>''The president's father was dealing with a not fully sovereign Germany, the legacy, if you like, of 20th-century history,'' said Michael Steiner, Mr. Schröder's chief diplomatic adviser. ''Now Germany is a partner without restrictions and what we want to address is not the leftovers of the last century, but the future of this one.''</p>
        <p>Viewing that future, Germany places a priority on the environment, on controlling global warming, on the development of the European Union as a strategic power with its own military component, on conciliation with Russia, and on ascertaining whether ''rogue'' threats are also real threats before building missile defense shields against them.</p>
        <p>All these positions will strain Mr. Schröder's first meeting with President Bush. But the chancellor has come to have a reasonable claim to be Europe's most successful politician precisely because he is a conciliator -- ''the man of reason, the peacemaker,'' as the Frankfurter Allgemeine recently put it. So no fireworks are likely.</p>
        <p>After a shaky start, Mr. Schröder, a Social Democrat, has astutely positioned his party as a modernizing force for the economy and captured the repressed yearnings of many Germans by speaking of himself as ''a patriot.'' He has also deftly co-opted opponents and exploited the opposition Christian Democrats' divisions to emerge as a figure with the authority to tell Mr. Bush what is on Europeans' minds.</p>
        <p>The concerns include the food they eat, the air they breathe, and the peaceful coming-together of a long-divided continent. Frank Walter Steinmayer, the chancellor's chief of staff, said President Bush's decision to expel 50 Russian diplomats had prompted ''surprise and deep concern.'' So, too, did Mr. Bush's decision to go back on his campaign pledge to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.</p>
        <p>Germany, like most European countries, is committed to the carbon dioxide emission standards set at a 1997 international conference -- standards that President Bush now appears ready to ignore.</p>
        <p>''We are very concerned about the environment, where we see different values,'' Mr. Steiner said. ''And about food, where the attachment to quality and opposition to genetically modified products is very strong in Europe.''</p>
        <p>He compared the situation in Britain, where over 400,000 pigs, sheep and cows have been slaughtered in recent weeks to fight foot-and-mouth disease, to ''Armageddon,'' suggesting this was an illustration that ''nature, if it is not respected, strikes back.''</p>
        <p>Such views may raise eyebrows in  the Bush administration, but Mr. Schröder will put them forcefully. The 1990's were years of profound transformation in Europe, propelled by the hot wars of the Balkans and the cold war's end, and there is a feeling in Berlin that the Republicans have not yet grasped Europe's coming of age.</p>
