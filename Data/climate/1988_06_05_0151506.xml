        <p>LEAD: ATLHOUGH the state requires car emissions to be tested every year, trucks and buses have been exempt.</p>
        <p>ATLHOUGH the state requires car emissions to be tested every year, trucks and buses have been exempt.</p>
        <p>The state is now studying the feasibility of testing 40,000 trucks and 400 buses.</p>
        <p>In 1983, the Federal Clean Air Act mandated the state to set up inspections for gasoline-powered automobiles. Diesel trucks and buses emit different chemicals, and experts say they do not add to the ozone problem. But environmental groups charge that the diesel emissions can cause health problems and water pollution.</p>
        <p>''We think it's really important to regulate diesel because it causes constant recurring health problems such as respiratory infection,'' said Suzanne Mattei, the director of the Connecticut Fund for the Environment in New Haven. ''It's also important for political reasons. People have to think the system is fair.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Mattei said her organization has urged legislators to expand the emissions program, which is run by the State Department of Motor Vehicles, to include diesel vehicles.</p>
        <p>The Department of Environmental Protection has hired the Radian Corporation of Austin, Tex., to study the possible addition of diesel vehicles to the program, said the director of the air compliance unit, Leonard Bruckman. Diesels engines could be inspected in a few years.</p>
        <p>''Diesel particulates are potentially carcinogenic,'' Mr. Bruckman said. ''It's getting very costly to implement these programs, and the Federal Government, under this Administration, isn't working real hard to clean up the air. So the state is taking the initiative. We're interested in controlling all toxins in the air.''</p>
        <p>The study is a result of a program the Department of Environmental Protection developed in 1986. The department looked at 856 atmospheric compounds and found those from trucks and buses potentially hazardous, Mr. Bruckman said.</p>
        <p>The assistant planning director of the Department of Transportation, William Messner, estimated that 20 percent of all vehicles on highways and roads in the state were trucks. He also said truckers would not ''be too delighted'' to be in the emissions program because it might cause delays.</p>
        <p>''Everything is punitive today,'' said Norman Truchman, a truck driver and owner of Bechem Transport Inc. in New Haven. ''If your signal light is out, you get a $50 fine.</p>
        <p>''We're in the trucking business. We can't be stopping 50 million times. We already have to stop to have our brakes and lights checked.''</p>
        <p>Trucks are required to be inspected at weigh stations in five areas on Interstate 95. Michael Riley, president of the Motor Transport Association, which represents trucking companies inside and outside Connecticut, said that there were long waiting lines at the stations and that sometimes truckers were detained hours for defects.</p>
        <p>''It seems it would be better for air quality to keep trucks moving along, rather than waiting on an emissions line,'' he said. ''We're all for clean air. But I think for the trouble and cost, it might translate more into a logistical nightmare than an environmental stroke of genius.''</p>
        <p>The director of development for Connecticut Transit, Stephen Warren, said he did not foresee problems with emissions inspections for buses. ''We do preventive maintenance on our buses regularly,'' he said. ''And we would do whatever had to be done. Our prime concern is compliance.'' Mr. Riley said he felt the program would not be effective because it would affect just Connecticut vehicles and not the trucks registered elsewhere the cross the state.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bruckman conceded that pollution from out-of-state trucks would still present a problem.</p>
        <p>In addition, Mr. Riley said, such a program would be prohibitively expensive because the testing of diesel vehicles is more complicated than for cars, and testing sites would have to be built across the state.</p>
        <p>''We've got enough laws now,'' said Frank Hitchcock, president of Hitchcock Brothers, a trucker in Canaan. ''We don't need any more. It would start here. But soon there will be reciprocity with other states, and the Federal Government won't be in charge. It will be up to the states, and it will be expensive.''</p>
        <p>''Besides,'' Mr. Riley said, ''our problem is the Ohio Valley, where acid rain and other pollutants come from, not the highways.''</p>
