        <p>Probing the depths of the Black Sea off the coast of Turkey, oceanographers and archaeologists have found a 1,500-year-old ship resting on the bottom, its wooden hull almost perfectly preserved and its mast still standing tall.</p>
        <p>Robert D. Ballard, the expedition leader, said yesterday that the discovery of this and three other ancient shipwrecks this summer confirmed that the deep water of the Black Sea -- with no oxygen to sustain wood-boring worms -- was an ideal environment for preserving wooden artifacts. These waters, Dr. Ballard said, ''probably held more preserved history than any other place in the world.''</p>
        <p>But he conceded that in its first summer, the expedition had not found conclusive evidence supporting the hypothesis that a cataclysmic flood, perhaps an inspiration for the biblical story of Noah, struck the Black Sea region 7,600 years ago.</p>
        <p>Dr. Ballard and the principal archaeologists described the expedition's findings at the National Geographic Society in Washington.</p>
        <p>The exploration was conducted off Sinop, Turkey, with robotic submarines equipped with sonar, cameras and mechanical devices for retrieving small artifacts and wood samples. Radiocarbon testing showed that the vessel was built between A.D. 410 and 520.</p>
        <p>Cheryl Ward, a specialist in ancient ships at Florida State University who is also affiliated with the Institute of Nautical Archaeology at Texas A &amp; M, estimated that the ship was 45 feet long and had a 35-foot-tall mast, which probably supported a triangular sail. The quality of construction and the technology appeared to be more sophisticated than had been expected, Ms. Ward said.</p>
        <p>The ship rests at a depth of 1,000 feet, about 350 feet below the boundary between the oxygen-rich surface waters and the oxygen-deprived waters trapped at depths unaffected by the sea's general circulation. The three other shipwrecks are at the boundary and so have suffered much more decay. The ships, dating to the Roman-Byzantine period from the fourth to sixth centuries A.D., carried terra-cotta amphorae, the jugs commonly used to transport wine, olive oil and other liquids.</p>
        <p>Fredrik T. Hiebert, an archaeologist at the University of Pennsylvania, said core samples from the sea floor had yielded evidence that it was dry land more than 7,000 years ago. Tests also indicated that before the old shoreline was inundated, the Black Sea had been fresh water.</p>
        <p>These are among the strands of evidence that two Columbia University marine geologists, William B. F. Ryan and Walter C. Pitman III, have woven into a theory that rising sea levels after the last ice age caused water to burst through the narrow Bosporus and flood the Black Sea with saltwater. This submerged original shorelines and presumably caused people to abandon their homes and migrate.</p>
