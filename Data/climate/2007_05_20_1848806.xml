        <p>AN EXPENSIVE LEMON</p>
        <p>The News Nine years after Daimler-Benz spent $36 billion for Chrysler and invested billions more in the company, the German automaker sold Chrysler to a private equity firm for $7.4 billion.</p>
        <p>Behind the News The 1998 deal was portrayed as a marriage of equals but never resulted in the savings or market power that its creators expected. Chrysler's fortunes were up and down, with profitable years followed by years of losses, including a $1.5 billion loss last year. Now Cerberus Capital Management, which specializes in restructuring troubled companies, will try its luck. ''We obviously underestimated the potential of synergies,'' Daimler's chief executive, Dieter Zetsche, said.</p>
        <p>BRING YOUR WALLET</p>
        <p>The News Gasoline prices hit a new record at the pump this week, rising to a national average price of $3.129 a gallon.</p>
        <p>Behind the News With prices so high, it must mean -- you guessed it -- that the summer vacation season is just around the bend. Refinery outages and tight supplies have sent pump prices soaring by some 40 percent since January, and in some cities, the price is nearing $4. Wal-Mart says high gas prices have kept people from coming to its stores, but the auto group AAA said it expects 38 million Americans to travel at least 50 miles on the Memorial Day weekend. Perhaps they can fantasize that they're filling up at a European petrol station, where astronomic gas prices are the norm.</p>
        <p>FLUNKING INSPECTION</p>
        <p>The News Dale Earnhardt Jr., the son of a legend and the most popular driver in Nascar, was severely penalized by Nascar officials, along with his race team and crew chief.</p>
        <p>Behind the News Nascar officials said Earnhardt's car failed an inspection in what they viewed as a deliberate attempt to circumvent the rules. Inspectors said the rear wing was improperly mounted. Earnhardt was docked 100 points in the Chase for the Nextel Cup, knocking him from 12th to 14th place; his crew chief was fined $100,000 and suspended until after July 4. ''It is what it is,'' said the racing team's president, Max Siegel. ''It was a mistake, and it's unfortunate. But we'll move on.''</p>
        <p>REGULATING EMISSIONS</p>
        <p>The News President Bush ordered government officials to draft regulations to reduce gas consumption and greenhouse gas emissions from new cars and trucks.</p>
        <p>Behind the News The order came a month after the Supreme Court, rebuffing the administration's arguments, found that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases qualify as pollutants under the law and must be regulated if they endanger public health. Mr. Bush had opposed mandatory limits. It is not clear what the new rules will look like, and the process of writing and implementing them won't be completed until the end of 2008, just weeks before his term ends. Mr. Bush says he wants to reduce gas consumption by 20 percent over 10 years.</p>
        <p>SELF-PROPULSION</p>
        <p>The News The City of Light is preparing to make 20,000 bikes available for rent to ease traffic and reduce air pollution.</p>
        <p>Behind the News Paris may be for lovers, but a lot of them apparently drive cars. That has led to notoriously congested traffic and air pollution. So, borrowing an idea from the city of Lyons to the southeast, Paris is preparing to make the bikes available for rent at about 1,400 rental stations around the city, beginning in mid-July. For a few euros, riders can rent a bike, then drop it off at any rental station. In Lyon, with 2,000 bikes, there are up to 16,000 rentals a day. Each bike is used by as many as 15 people a day; the average trip is 1.7 miles, says Cyclocity, which runs the program.</p>
