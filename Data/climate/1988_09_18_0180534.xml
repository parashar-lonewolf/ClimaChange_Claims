        <p>LEAD: SUMMER 1988. What a dud. In the county we expected (because of past experiences) no spring - and got none. We did, however, expect a summer - and got Hell instead.</p>
        <p>SUMMER 1988. What a dud. In the county we expected (because of past experiences) no spring - and got none. We did, however, expect a summer - and got Hell instead.</p>
        <p>Going from the rainy, feels-like-mold-is-growing-on-our-feet days of spring, we relished those first dog days. Ah, we said, it's only June, and look at this fine beach weather we're having. But day after day of horrid, torrid weather quickly wore us down.</p>
        <p>People recalled other places, other times of extreme heat. I had flashbacks of one childhood summer when neighbors sat languidly on front porches, with foldout paper fans in one hand and a glass of lemonade in the other. Scorched plains of Texas and windless magnolia trees in the Deep South came to mind. As did equatorial rain forests and sand dunes in the Sahara.</p>
        <p>But, wait - this is New York and we do have advanced technology. There should be some other ways to beat the heat. I envisioned an insulated space suit - filled with ice cubes. Or a domed city, climatically controlled. Or establishing summer residences on ice shelves in Antarctica.</p>
        <p>In lieu of any redeeming scientific discoveries, we made do with what we had. We had to. Some coped by doing something; other coped by not doing anything. My neighbor, for instance, took out her vacuum cleaner; for two weeks it lay sprawled, unused on the living room rug like an exhausted creature.</p>
        <p>Another person, who disliked alcohol, nonetheless spent her summer evenings in the local bar, playing Trivial Pursuit and Scrabble. People fled to the apartments of those with air-conditioning; these were homes of warm-weather friends, though not necessarily those of fair-weather friends. And we started to believe that ''Think Snow'' wasn't such a bad idea for a bumper sticker, after all.</p>
        <p>Frizzy hair was back in fashion, by popular demand. Using the heat as an excuse not to clean house, do the laundry, mow the lawn, or go to the dentist were also fashionable.</p>
        <p>Smelly mossbunkers washed up on our shores, as did all sorts of miscellaneous, disgusting stuff that we could actually see (as opposed to merely imagining, or reading about in the papers). The ozone layer was all fouled up. Potato-soup fog greeted us in the morning. Severe storms, preceded by eerie clouds, descended on us from the Land of Oz -or wherever it is those summer storms originate (Kansas?).</p>
        <p>Anything that didn't have to be cooked was popular. Pizzerias, neighborhood delis and Chinese takeouts did record business. Although it felt like we were in an oven, we forgot what the insides of our kitchen ovens looked like. While on the subject of cooking, many ideas this summer were half-baked; it was too hot even to think.</p>
        <p>People dripped from one air-conditioned place to another. Those who had only one (!) air-conditioner tended to spend the summer in one room. Eating dinner in the bedroom or sleeping on the dining-room floor became a daily habit. The one air-conditioned room became claustrophobic; I wonder whether we will see studies of summer cabin fever.</p>
        <p>And I wonder if people who develop S.A.D. (Seasonal Affective Disorder) because of a lack of sunlight in the winter, can also develop an opposite affliction in the summer. Steinbeck gave us the ''winter of our discontent''; Mother Nature gave us the ''summer of our discomfort.'' And speaking of books, did you notice how art reflected life this past summer? Words like ''misery,'' ''hot,'' ''depression,'' ''intensive,'' ''chaos'' and ''fog'' all appeared in the titles of books on this summer's best-sellers list. And in a twist of irony, the book titled ''Alaska'' reached No. 1.</p>
