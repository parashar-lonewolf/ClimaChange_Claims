        <p>LEAD: The chemical threat to the life-protecting ozone layer in the high atmosphere turns out to be more serious than feared.

        <p>The chemical threat to the life-protecting ozone layer in the high atmosphere turns out to be more serious than feared. The damage may already be three times greater than the worst future loss assumed in a pending international treaty to cap production of the destructive chemicals. Even stronger measures may soon be needed.</p>
        <p>The ozone layer screens out the part of the sun's ultraviolet light that harms living things. Scientists have long warned that the ozone might be destroyed by the chlorine wafted up in man-made chemicals known as chlorofluorocarbons, or CFC's. These are widely used as refrigerants and in auto air-conditioners and foam packaging.</p>
        <p>Those warnings, disputed at first, have become increasingly credible, although the evidence is still circumstantial. Ground and satellite readings confirm a decline in global ozone. Ozone fluctuates for natural reasons, but chlorine from CFC's is present in the high atmosphere, and most scientists now believe chlorine is implicated in the recently discovered ''ozone hole'' over Antarctica.</p>
        <p>Each 1 percent drop in ozone is thought to allow a 2 to 3 percent rise in the ultraviolet light reaching the earth. No one knows what effect that might have, but any large increase would be reason for serious concern. The light is destructive to DNA, the hereditary material, and to proteins. Damage to plankton, organisms that inhabit the upper few feet of the oceans, would quickly reverberate through ocean food chains. People could suffer increased skin cancer and impairment of the immune system.</p>
        <p>Last year the State Department, led by Ambassador Richard Benedick, scored the notable coup of persuading European countries, with their reluctant chemical industries, to join a pact to control CFC's and halons. Under the Montreal protocol, production is to be frozen at 1986 levels, then cut in half by 1999. Computer models suggested this reduction would hold the global ozone loss to 1 percent, compared with 6 percent without controls. The Senate recently ratified the treaty by 83 to 0.</p>
        <p>But the computer models underestimated. A new NASA review of past measurements suggests the ozone layer has already been depleted by up to 3 percent since 1969. The models also failed to predict the Antarctic ozone hole, where 50 percent or more of ozone is lost. It seems that a circular flow of winds develops over the Antarctic each September, isolating the air from the rest of the atmosphere. Within this cool vortex, conditions are ideal for chlorine to destroy ozone. When the vortex breaks up in October, the ozone-depleted air may spread, accounting for some of the global depletion.</p>
        <p>Still, though it's prudent to prepare for the worst, newly published data seem to show that the ultraviolet light reaching the U.S. has diminished during the time the ozone layer was thinning. This puzzling finding has yet to be explained.</p>
        <p>All the more reason to hold off panicky attempts to renegotiate the Montreal protocol before it is ratified. The most urgent step is to get it ratified by enough countries to put it into effect. European countries have opted for a procedure that invites delay. China has not even signed on.</p>
        <p>If current estimates of the ozone threat are confirmed, the next step should be a new international agreement to tighten the CFC production target. An 85 percent reduction is needed simply to prevent the ozone hole getting any worse; a 95 percent reduction would let it heal over decades.</p>
        <p>CFC's take some seven years to reach the ozone layer, so that corrective action will take years to have any effect. There is no time to wait for evidence of biological damage. The Montreal treaty is a fine first step, if a second will follow quickly.</p>
