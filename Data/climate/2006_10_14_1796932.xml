        <p>DUPONT this week announced a ''sustainability'' initiative, making it the latest big company to jump on the green bandwagon.</p>
        <p>DuPont, of course, ''is not exactly beloved of environmentalists,'' as the Gristmill blog (gristmill.grist.org) notes. It has been drawing the wrath of environmentalists since the 1930's.</p>
        <p>Last year, DuPont reached a $16.5 million settlement with the Environmental Protection Agency for failing to report information about the hazards associated with a substance used in making Teflon. In the 1970's and 1980's, the company had become notorious as the inventor and largest producer of chlorofluorocarbons, which were proved to deplete the ozone layer.</p>
        <p>But DuPont has also received plaudits for its environmental initiatives. Last year, BusinessWeek named it No. 1 on its list of the ''Top Green Companies'' (businessweek.com) and the company has twice won the National Medal of Technology -- most recently in 2002, for creating technologies that replaced the chlorofluorocarbons that had gotten it into trouble three decades before (technology.gov/medal).</p>
        <p>DuPont's ''2015 Sustainability Goals'' (introduced via a Webcast linked at gristmill.grist.org) include plans to derive $6 billion or more in new revenue from products that create energy efficiency or reduce harmful emissions, as well as those made from ''nondepletable'' resources.</p>
        <p>Last year, General Electric introduced its ''ecoimagination'' program (ge.ecomagination.com), which puts money and research behind energy efficient and ''environmentally advanced'' products. Wal-Mart, Ford and BP have all announced similar programs in recent years.</p>
        <p>While some environmental activists tend to label such initiatives as mere ''greenwashing'' -- that is, more public relations than anything else -- many mainstream environment watchers praise them as at least a step in the right direction. Still, given that such companies are industrial conglomerates that create huge amounts of waste and burn huge amounts of fossil fuels, they will probably never totally remake their image.</p>
        <p>As one commenter on Joel Makower's blog about sustainable business put it, ''a company that finances its green with funds generated by brown will always be a villain'' (makower.typepad.com).</p>
        <p>ET, TU? -- John B. Judis was a reader of BusinessWeek for 30 years, but not anymore. Mr. Judis, a senior editor at The New Republic, writes on that magazine's Web site that the proximate reason for canceling his subscription was the firing of BusinessWeek's ''terrific'' labor reporter Aaron Bernstein. But Mr. Bernstein's firing, done as part of a cost-cutting series of layoffs, is just a symptom of a much larger problem, Mr. Judis writes.</p>
        <p>Since Stephen J. Adler took over as editor in April 2005, BusinessWeek ''aspires to be the People of the business world,'' Mr. Judis writes.</p>
        <p>He compares some serious cover articles from just before Mr. Adler took over with several more lightweight ones that have been published since, including ''50 Best Places to Launch a Career'' and ''Revealed! Secrets of the Male Shopper'' (tnr.com -- registration required.)</p>
        <p>''Perhaps this new BusinessWeek will make more money than the old,'' Mr. Judis writes, but ''my guess is that under Adler, BusinessWeek will become a magazine that is neither particularly profitable nor socially useful.''</p>
        <p>''In any case, it has already lost at least one reader.''</p>
        <p>A FOOL AND HIS MONEY -- Casey Serin says he took some real estate investing courses, lied on some loan applications, bought some properties and promptly went broke. Now about $2 million in debt, the Sacramento resident has done what any blue-blooded young American would do in such a situation -- he started a blog.</p>
        <p>Iamfacingforclosure.com details Mr. Serin's travails, and it attracts a lot of sympathetic comments from readers.</p>
        <p>Less than sympathetic was Seth Jayson of Motley Fool (fool.com), whose excoriation of Mr. Serin (''greed makes you stupid'') was copied wholesale onto the young man's blog, in keeping with his philosophy of way too much disclosure.</p>
