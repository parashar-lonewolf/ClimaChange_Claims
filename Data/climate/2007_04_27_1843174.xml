        <p>Substantial new efforts will be needed worldwide to stem accelerating growth in greenhouse-gas emissions linked to rising global temperatures, according to a summary of a report being prepared by hundreds of climate scientists and economists working under the auspices of the United Nations.</p>
        <p>The summary, which is subject to revision, said that efforts to rein in the billions of tons of annual releases of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases would have to begin soon to limit risks of large changes in the climate and their impact on humans and nature.</p>
        <p>''Mitigation efforts over the next two to three decades will determine to a large extent the long-term global mean temperature increase and the corresponding climate change impacts that can be avoided,'' the draft said.</p>
        <p>The document will undergo substantial revisions during a weeklong meeting starting Monday in Bangkok, said scientists involved in reviewing and writing it, and authors of the report declined to discuss it.</p>
        <p>Copies of the report's 24-page summary for policy makers have been filtering to environmental groups, one of which provided a copy to The New York Times.</p>
        <p>Developing countries, where an unparalleled burst of industrialization and construction is under way, offer some of the biggest opportunities for avoiding climate-warming emissions, the draft said, particularly in choices of power plants and building designs.</p>
        <p>It said that changes in design standards and materials chosen for construction could trim about 30 percent of projected emissions of heat-trapping gases from buildings by 2020, with more than half of the cuts coming in developing countries. The improvements in buildings could come with a net saving to the economy from lower energy costs, it said.</p>
        <p>The report is part of the fourth assessment since 1990 of global warming by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, created nearly 20 years ago to assess evidence that human activities were affecting climate and to review policy options.</p>
        <p>In its latest climate review, released in February, the panel concluded with near certainty that smokestack and tailpipe emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases were the dominant cause of recent warming. A second report, released this month, said that ecosystems and climate patterns were already shifting as a result of the warming trend and that substantial risks to people, wildlife and coasts lay ahead.</p>
        <p>The new report will probably be contentious when it is reviewed in Bangkok by officials from more than 100 countries. Governments have the right to seek some changes.</p>
        <p>Clashes are likely, in part because this report touches most deeply both on domestic debates over climate, like the tussle in the United States over the need for a bill restricting gas emissions, and the fate of international climate agreements, particularly the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
