        <p>$700 BILLION, HERE WE COME -- The United States trade deficit probably shrank a tad in November, but not enough to avert a record gap for 2006. Economists expect Thursday's figures to show that the imbalance narrowed to $65.9 billion, from $68.9 billion in October, the highest in history, making it all but certain that the deficit will top $700 billion for the year, up from 2004's record $618 billion.</p>
        <p>GREENHOUSE GAS FORUM -- On Thursday, the United States and five Pacific nations -- Australia, China, India, Japan and South Korea -- will open a new forum in Sydney, Australia, on global warming. The inaugural meeting of the group, the Asia Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate, will discuss efforts to cut greenhouse gases that are believed to be responsible for rising world temperatures. Together, the six countries account for half of all greenhouse gas emissions. The energy secretary, Samuel W. Bodman, will head the American delegation.</p>
        <p>ECONOMIC STRENGTH -- Forget the trade gap for a moment; statistics due Friday are likely to show that the economy is otherwise in pretty good shape. Producer prices for December are expected to have increased a modest 0.2 percent, further evidence that inflation is under control, while retail sales in December are projected to show a healthy 0.9 percent gain.</p>
        <p>AUTO WOES CLOUD ANNUAL SHOW -- The North American International Auto Show, the industry's biggest annual event, opens to the public in Detroit on Saturday. The big players will be promoting hybrids, like General Motors' 2007 Saturn Vue Green Line and a Ford diesel-electric system that the company says will get 65 miles to the gallon. Already, however, the extravaganza is being overshadowed by the decline in sales, credit ratings and profit margins of America's automakers.</p>
        <p>ODDS AND ENDS  -- In other coming attractions, the jury will resume deliberations today in the trial for accounting fraud of Walter Forbes, above, the former chairman of the Cendant Corporation. It said on Thursday that it was deadlocked. Japan, a reawakening economic giant, will publish its index of leading economic indicators on Wednesday.  Sony executives will meet in Hawaii this week to talk about ways to cut $17 billion in costs over the next three years to stem a tide of red ink.  Plaintiffs in a Cincinnati suburb who are fighting the seizure of their homes for the benefit of a developer will argue their case on Wednesday before the Ohio Supreme Court.</p>
