        <p>LEAD: Industry in the United States and abroad is moving aggressively to curb uses of chemicals believed to be destroying the earth's ozone shield.</p>
        <p>Industry in the United States and abroad is moving aggressively to curb uses of chemicals believed to be destroying the earth's ozone shield.</p>
        <p>Somewhat to their surprise, those who make and use these widespread chemicals are finding that complying with a recent international treaty may be relatively painless. The treaty, negotiated last year in Montreal by 31 nations, calls for a leveling off and then a rolling back in production of the harmful chlorofluorocarbons and halons.</p>
        <p>An exception was made for developing countries to enable them to achieve industrial growth. For these countries, per capita consumption of the chemicals would be allowed to rise until it approximated the industrial countries' usage in 1986. Scientists do not expect such increased usage to have much impact on the ozone layer because the amounts involved would remain relatively low.</p>
        <p>Although the treaty does not mandate a freeze in production levels for industrial countries until next year, and the reductions will not start until 1994, many companies are already working furiously on substitutes in anticipation of huge demand. Some users have also started to employ products made with other substances.</p>
        <p>The treaty has not yet taken legal force, but its adoption by the required number of countries - at least 11, including countries that account for at least two-thirds of global production of the harmful compounds - is widely expected. So far, only the United States and Mexico have ratified the pact. Faster Action Is Sought</p>
        <p>Now, alarmed by increasing scientific evidence that the destruction of atmospheric ozone is more severe than previously thought, some experts are calling for even quicker removal of harmful chemicals from commerce. They note that ozone-destroying chemicals produced today can linger in the stratosphere, destroying ozone all the while, for a century or more.</p>
        <p>Industry and Government officials interviewed last week warned that speeding up the removal process could lead to serious economic and social disruption in the United States and elsewhere.</p>
        <p>Still, some scientists, environmentalists and members of Congress insisted that the risks of a slow response to the destruction of the ozone layer, including more skin cancers and losses to crops and ecosystems, far outweigh the potential costs of quicker action.</p>
        <p>The Montreal treaty to limit the use of chlorofluorocarbons, or CFC's, was viewed by participants as an act of probable environmental necessity but high economic risk.</p>
        <p>The chemicals are used in a wide range of products considered essential by modern society, including refrigerants, foams and solvents. Industry representatives in the United States and elsewhere accepted the need to curb use of these chemicals but said the process could lead to substantially higher prices, unemployment and other undesirable consequences.</p>
        <p>A half-year later, industry and goverments are finding that heroic effort may not be needed to comply with the treaty, which calls for a freeze on production and use of chlorofluorcarbons at 1986 levels by 1989 and a 50 percent reduction in production by the end of the century. The use of halons, chemicals in fire extinguishers, was to be frozen at 1986 levels with no rollback.</p>
        <p>If substitutes are found and put into use rapidly, there may not even be much of a leap in prices, industry officials now say.</p>
        <p>In fact, many producers and users of CFC's are already developing substitute chemicals or processes that will reduce or eliminate the need for CFC's In some cases, such as in packaging for fast foods, alternatives are already being adopted.</p>
        <p>Industry in Japan is reportedly moving at least as fast as here. According to some reports, European companies are also developing substitutes for CFC's to supply what is expected to be a wide-open new market. 'Will Be Some Anguish'</p>
        <p>''We think we can do it without undue disruption. There will be some anguish but nothing that will devastate society,'' said Richard C. Barnett, chairman of the Alliance for A Responsible CFC Policy, an association of American companies that make or use chlorofluorocarbons.</p>
        <p>But industry and Reagan Administration officials said it was too early to talk about faster and deeper cuts in CFC use and that an accelerated phaseout would cause serious economic disruptions.</p>
        <p>''The rapid, complete shutdown of CFC's that some people are calling for would have horrendous consequences,'' said Mr. Barnett. ''Some industries would have to shut down because they cannot get alternative products - the cure could kill the patient.''</p>
        <p>CFC's were first developed by the Du Pont Company and the General Motors Corporation in the 1930's. Because of their many excellent chemical properties - they are very stable and not flammable, corrosive or toxic - they were quickly adopted for many uses, including insulation foam blowing, aerosol propellents, packaging and cleaning solvents for electronic and medical equipment.</p>
        <p>It is that stability, scientists now realize, that makes CFC's dangerous. Because these compounds do not break down chemically for many decades, they move intact up into the stratosphere, which begins six to 15 miles above the earth's surface depending on local conditions. And there, most scientists now agree, the CFC's continually combine with and destroy molecules of ozone, an unstable variant of oxygen.</p>
        <p>Because ozone in the upper atmosphere shields the earth's surface from harmful ultraviolet radiation, scientists warn that its thinning will allow more of this radiation to reach the earth, causing millions more cases of skin cancer as well as severe damage to aquatic life, crops and forests.</p>
        <p>CFC's are also believed to contribute to the projected warming of the earth's surface as man-made gases accumulate in the atmosphere and prevent warm infrared radiation from the sun from escaping back into space. New Scientific Reports</p>
        <p>Until fairly recently, there was substantial skepticism about the theory that man-made chemicals were depleting the ozone layer, but a growing body of empirical data led to a gradual acceptance of the theory as fact.</p>
        <p>Last week a report by about 100 scientists, prepared under the supervision of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, confirmed earlier reports that ozone was being destroyed over the Northern Hemisphere more rapidly than scientific models had projected.</p>
        <p>The new report stimulated warnings from environmentalists and some scientists that the pace of reducing CFC's in the environment must accelerate, if necessary with unilateral action by the United States. This country accounts for more than one-fourth of the world's production and use of the chemicals.</p>
        <p>Rafe Pomerance, senior associate of the World Resources Institute, a Washingto-based research and police group, said the new findings demonstrate that ''the situation is far worse that was predicted during the past year. If the Montreal negotiators had had these findings in front of them they would have agreed to a total phaseout of CFC's.''</p>
        <p>The Montreal treaty calls for a reconvening of signatory nations in 1990 to consider scientific evidence accumulated since 1987 and to decide if additional steps are necessary. Another clause authorizes the director of the United Nations Environment Program to call an emergency meeting if new evidence shows that urgent action is needed.</p>
        <p>Some environmentalists and scientists say the new report gives ample reason for calling an emergency meeting. But industry and government officials believe that precipitate action would accomplish nothing to preserve the ozone layer and could cause substantial harm to economies worldwide. Need for Testing</p>
        <p>Joseph M. Steed, environmental manager of the freon products division of Du Pont, one of the biggest manufacturers of CFC's, said if that a mandatory phaseout of CFC's was required by as early as 1993, the substitute chemicals or alternative industrial processes simply would not have been developed and tested. For example, a major use of one form of CFC is for highly efficient insulation in the walls of home refrigerators. ''Nobody wants to go with a product that will be in everyone's kitchen and then find it is toxic,'' Mr. Steed said.</p>
        <p>He also said that speeding up the withdrawal of CFC's would require many trade-offs that could affect the economy, public health and even national security. Mr. Steed noted, for example, that 75 percent of the nation's food supply is refrigerated at some point between the farm and the consumers' table. If the supply of CFC's used in refrigeration were cut off before substitutes were developed and tested, he warned, it could affect the food marketing chain and perhaps pose health dangers.</p>
        <p>Another trade-off, Mr. Steed said, would be caused by removing the form of CFC used to clean electronic equipment. ''What CFC's have offered in-dustry is a clean product,'' he said. ''The cleanliness determines the reli-ability of the product. We are talk-ing here about stereos and television sets. How about computer systems ruining our national defense, our airline traffic, our entire communications network.''</p>
        <p>He added, however, that Du Pont is working on a substitute solvent that would substantially reduce CFC emissions. Benefits of Removal</p>
        <p>Eileen B. Claussen, director of program development for the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, said that any decision to move faster against CFC's should be deferred until the scheduled 1990 meeting. Meanwhile, she said, the United States should push hard to have the Montreal treaty ratified by more countries.</p>
        <p>Ms. Claussen said it probably would be possible to reduce CFC use by 90 percent without severe disruptions, but not as early as 1993.</p>
        <p>A ''regulatory impact analysis'' by the E.P.A. estimated that by the year 2075 it would cost this country alone at least $27 billion to make the investments required by CFC provisions of the Montreal treaty.</p>
        <p>But the cost of removing CFC's from the environment pales next to the environmental agency's estimates of the benefits of doing so. According to the E.P.A. projection, the country would save nearly $6.5 trillion by 2075 by avoiding the costs of cancer deaths and medical treatment, and of lost crops, dwindling fish harvests, damage to materials and rising sea levels that would be incurred if no controls were placed on emissions of CFC's.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, industry, in this country at least, is moving ahead in developing and using substitutes. For example, companies that make disposable plastic packaging, such as containers for fast-food hamburgers, expect to phase out one kind of CFC by the end of this year and substitute another that depletes 20 times less ozone.</p>
        <p>To Stephen O. Anderson, an E.P.A. economist who is working with and encouraging industry in finding substitutes for CFC's, ''One of the most exciting things that has happened since the protocol is that more and more companies are considering this a business opportunity, not just as a problem.''</p>
