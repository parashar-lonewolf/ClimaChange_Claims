        <p>Stars Align for 'Live Earth' at Giants Stadium</p>
        <p>Bon Jovi, the Police, Kanye West and the ''American Idol'' winner Kelly Clarkson are to perform on July 7 at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., in the climax of ''Live Earth,'' a globe-spanning day of concerts intended to draw attention to global warming, The Associated Press reported. Others on the scheduled program are Alicia Keys, the Dave Matthews Band, Fall Out Boy, Ludacris, John Mayer, Melissa Etheridge, Rihanna and the Smashing Pumpkins. To be broadcast by more than 120 television outlets around the world and streamed live online, the concerts will take place in Shanghai, Johannesburg, Sydney, Tokyo and Rio de Janeiro, and organizers have also promised an event in Antarctica. Proceeds will create a foundation led by the Alliance for Climate Protection, with former Vice President Al Gore as chairman.</p>
        <p>Millions for Chinese Art</p>
        <p>A rare oil by the artist Xu Beihong went for $9.2 million at a Sotheby's auction in Hong Kong, a record for a Chinese painting at auction, Reuters reported. Mr. Xu, who lived from 1895 to 1953, is considered the father of modern Chinese painting. The work, ''Put Down Your Whip,'' above, depicting a 1939 anti-Japanese street play in China, went to an anonymous bidder on Saturday. In four days of sales that ended yesterday, Sotheby's sold a total of $135 million of mainly Chinese artwork, including $27.5 million in contemporary pieces. Despite strong demand, Henry Howard-Sneyd, Sotheby's deputy chairman for Europe and Asia, said in an interview that he expected the surge in prices of Modern and contemporary Chinese paintings to level off. ''The contemporary Chinese art market is no longer massively undervalued,'' he said, adding, ''We've still got some price jumps to come, but I think the jumps will be much less significant now.''</p>
        <p>Encore for Movie Hounds</p>
        <p>In true show-business fashion, two black Labrador retrievers who took their act on the road and became a smash hit have been held over indefinitely. The retrievers, Lucky and Flo, above, lent to Malaysia by the Motion Picture Association of America to sniff out counterfeit DVDs, were originally to stay abroad for a month. Billed as the only dogs in the world trained to detect a chemical used in making the discs, they took part in raids on warehouses, shops and offices that uncovered 1.2 million pirated DVDs and CDs worth nearly $3.5 million. Adding drama and suspense to the dogs' exploits, Malaysian movie pirates have reportedly put bounties on their heads. At the request of the Malaysian government, Lucky and Flo will be based there ''for the foreseeable future,'' said Neil Gane, the motion picture association's senior operations executive.</p>
        <p>At the Japan Society</p>
        <p>After two years without a gallery director, the Japan Society in Manhattan has named Joe Earle, a curator at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Mr. Earle, who currently heads the department of Asian, Oceanic and African art at the Boston museum, is to assume his new role on Sept. 4 and will also hold the title of vice president. The previous gallery director at Japan Society, Alexandra Munroe, resigned in April 2005 amid considerable turmoil. After trustees complained about several staff departures and the cancellations of art exhibitions, Frank L. Ellsworth resigned as president of Japan Society in April 2006. He was replaced by Richard J. Wood, who has sought to revive the exhibition schedule. Mr. Earle said in a statement on Monday that he looked forward to building ''a distinctive, durable and popular exhibition program that covers many aspects of Japanese art, both traditional and contemporary.'' Japan Society is celebrating its centennial.</p>
        <p>China's Bruce Lee Series</p>
        <p>Bruce Lee, below, the kung fu star who died at 32 in 1973, will return as the subject of a 40-part television series filmed by China's national broadcaster, The Associated Press reported. China Central Television began filming ''The Legend of Bruce Lee,'' starring Chen Guokun, over the weekend in Shunde in Guangdong Province in southern China, the Xinhua News agency reported. Shunde is the ancestral home of Lee, who was born in San Francisco in 1940. Mr. Chen is best known for his role in the action comedy ''Kung Fu Hustle.'' The television series is to be broadcast in 2008.</p>
        <p>A Pharaoh's Stolen Hair</p>
        <p>Locks of 3,200-year-old royal hair, above, that were stolen 30 years ago were displayed yesterday at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, The Associated Press reported. The small tufts of brown hair from the pharaoh Ramses II were stolen while the mummy was in France for treatment to halt the spread of a rare fungus, and the theft was discovered when the hair was offered for sale for $2,600 last November on the Internet. The seller, identified as Jean-Michel Diebolt, a postman who is the son of the researcher who examined the mummy when it was in France, is being investigated there.</p>
