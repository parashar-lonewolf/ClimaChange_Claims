        <p>IN Syracuse, birthplace of the serrated knife and the dental chair, as the city boasts, folks have been patiently distilling authentic Rust Belt culture. Pardon the grins, but winter is over, and global warming doesn't exactly panic a town that regularly wins the Golden Snowball award for upstate New York's most shoveled-out winter (www.goldensnowball.com).</p>
        <p>Half a century ago, Syracuse's pro team, the Nationals, was a power in the National Basketball Association, its General Electric plant made the hot new television set and the Carrier Corporation built the giant air-conditioners that enabled Southern states to steal its factories. That was then; this is, well, something else. Just think of the 'Cuse as your past and future, waiting to be rediscovered.</p>
        <p>HART SEELY</p>
        <p>Friday</p>
        <p>3 p.m  1 -- Take That, Tokyo!</p>
        <p>Channel the spirit of Godzilla as you stomp toward Big Ben and the Seattle Space Needle. Behold the skyline of Toothpick City, an exhibit at the Milton J. Rubenstein Museum of Science &amp; Technology (500 South Franklin Street, 315-425-9068; www.most.org). The North Syracuse artist Stan Munro has glued and fitted 1.3 million toothpicks into scale models of the Empire State Building, the Eiffel Tower and other postcards from earth for the exhibit, which runs through August. Admission is $4, $3.50 for ages 11 and under and 65 and older. What secrets lurk inside the great toothpick Pyramid of Khufu? You'll wonder after every meal.</p>
        <p>4:30 p.m.  2 -- Lines at the Pump</p>
        <p>Don't sweat all the sword-and-sorcery displays at the Middle Ages Brewing Company; its original Grail Ale concept hatched from a Monty Python script. You'll find folks bellying up to the counter, sipping grog and confronting their own middle ages. The brewery (120 Wilkinson Street, 315-476-4250; www.middleagesbrewing.com) holds free beer-tasting sessions every day but Sunday. Regulars also fill up their half-gallon brown jugs, called growlers, at the tap (prices run $7 to $12). Taste, but don't guzzle. Some ales, like the Wailing Wench, pack an 8-percent wallop.</p>
        <p>6 p.m.  3 -- Red Sauce at Night</p>
        <p>With its concrete facade, Angotti's Family Restaurant (725 Burnet Avenue, 315-472-8403) resembles a three-bedroom house that's been converted into a bomb shelter. Get there too late and you'll have to wait on the sidewalk (only large-group reservations are accepted) for the tasty Italian fare. Most entrees are less than $7.</p>
        <p>8 p.m.  4 -- Take My Campus, Please</p>
        <p>''When you see God, you can't go back and tell everyone how handsome he is.'' So go the streams of consciousness from the Zamboni Revolution, a team of Syracuse University students who perform improvisational comedy throughout the school year. The mostly free student comedy and music shows at the Schine Student Center (303 University Avenue) are part of the regular weekend avalanche of campus events. Information: 315-443-4240 or online at suevents.syr.edu.</p>
        <p>10 p.m.  5 -- Caffeinated Rap</p>
        <p>Outside 387 West Onondaga Street, young men pace the sidewalk, muttering to themselves. They are memorizing their lines for the weekend open-mike night at the Onajava Coffee &amp; Soul Cafe. This night, as a 16-year-old rapper takes the stage, his mom cries, ''That's my baby!'' from her table. The stream of poetry, soul, rap, gospel and jazz starts after 10 p.m. Free admission, two-drink minimum for open-mike nights. The $3.95 cappuccino comes in a cup tall as your forearm. Drink two and you'll stay up late, slinging rhymes. No phone, but see www.soulofsyracuse.com/onajava/.</p>
        <p>Midnight  6 -- Slathered</p>
        <p>Loud music, B-movie posters and smart-mouth waitresses at Dinosaur Bar-B-Que bring what most patrons want: immediate sensory overload. This densely packed biker-yuppie ribs joint (246 West Willow Street, 315-476-4937; www.dinosaurbarbque.com) has spawned satellites in Rochester and Manhattan. Regulars come early, give their names to the all-powerful hostess and sometimes wait an hour for a booth. The Dino menu boasts of ''slathering'' sauce, a word that also describes the action in the crowd once the bands roll into their second set.</p>
        <p>Saturday</p>
        <p>10 a.m.  7 -- I Am the Eggman</p>
        <p>''If there's a cure for this, I don't want it,'' warbles Alan, the singing omeleteer, in the Food Court at Wegman's Food Market (6789 East Genesee Street, Fayetteville; 315-446-1180) as he swirls a whipped cream smiley-face onto a $5.99 Belgian waffle. In a town of great homey diners, why eat at a suburban supermarket? Simple. At ''Weggy's'' you can snag a five-pound bag of Hinerwadel's Salt Potatoes ($2.99), the blue-collar delicacy that is to Syracuse what chicken wings are to Buffalo. They look like doughnut holes, but don't be deceived: humanity has never devised a finer delivery system for butter and salt.</p>
        <p>11:30 a.m.  8 -- A Delicate Moment</p>
        <p>Designed by I. M. Pei, the Everson Museum of Art (401 Harrison Street, 315-474-6064; www.everson.org) holds 11,000 works, including a huge collection of extremely delicate ceramics -- and a few quirky ones, too (above right). Admission is free, but a $5 donation is delicately suggested. The museum devotes a whole room to the native son Gustav Stickley (1858-1942) and his Mission oak furniture.</p>
        <p>2:30 p.m.  9 -- Deep Green</p>
        <p>Across suburbia, green water can mean a fried squirrel in the pool filter. But in the expansive Green Lakes State Park, a 20-minute drive from Syracuse (7900 Green Lakes Road, Fayetteville; 315-637-6111; $7 a car from Memorial Day to Labor Day), two clear green lakes get their brilliant color from limestone bedrock. They plunge to depths of 198 feet -- early settlers thought them bottomless. Impress folks by announcing that these lakes are meromictic, which means the upper and lower levels don't mix. Hike 20 miles of trails, swim or picnic.</p>
        <p>6 p.m.  10 -- A Full Plate and Glass</p>
        <p>You know those hoity-toity bistros, where you can spend $100 and still want to top off at Taco Bell on the ride home? They got chased out of Syracuse. Pascale Wine Bar and Restaurant (204 West Fayette Street, 315-471-3040), with live jazz and walls of eclectic art, serves pooh-bahs and proletarians. The Game Sampler ($28) features antelope medallions, roasted squab, rabbit sausage and wild huckleberry sauce.</p>
        <p>10 p.m.  11 -- Late Shift</p>
        <p>Years ago, when Shifty's (1401 Burnet Avenue, 315-474-0048; www.shiftysbar.com) changed hands, the deal stipulated that it remain a neighborhood bar offering live music. There, the bands play for friends, fans and the former hippies who shoot pool in the back. One night last year, the comedian and Syracusan Tom Kenny -- the voice of SpongeBob -- returned to front a blues band. At one point, he slithered across the entire place on his hands and knees, singing ''Do the Crawl.'' Drink the ''Shifty 50'' tour of beers, but not in one night, of course.</p>
        <p>Sunday</p>
        <p>10 a.m.  12 -- Land of the Flea</p>
        <p>Never say junk. Say ''merchandise with a past.'' Four pavilions of distinctive treasures await you at the Central New York Regional Flea Market (2100 Park Street, 315-422-8647): odd lots, factory mistakes and future antiques. Really, didn't you always want a watercolor portrait of Vin Diesel? Two for $10? Make an offer!</p>
        <p>3 p.m.  13 -- The Central New York Sound</p>
        <p>When the guitars begin, bodies thrash, fists pump and shouts of ''HardCORE! HardCORE!'' fill the Westcott Community Center (826 Euclid Avenue). Headlining this day was Path of Resistance, the remnants of Earth Crisis, a 90's straightedge band that made Syracuse a center for animal rights, vegan lifestyles and music too intense for boomer eardrums. The straightedge scene may have faded, but hardcore shows regularly pop up in community centers or even vacant houses. Track them at www.315hardcore.com or on the wall at Halo Tattoos and Bodypiercing (171 Marshall Street). Just don't stand too close when the music starts, or you'll spend your 37th hour in Syracuse in an emergency ward.</p>
        <p>THE BASICS</p>
        <p>Rust Belt Renewal</p>
        <p>Round-trip flights between New York City and Syracuse start about $155. Amtrak takes about five and a half hours to make the trip, usually for $78 one way. You can drive the 250 miles in about four hours.</p>
        <p>The Marx Hotel and Conference Center, 701 East Genesee Street, (315-479-7000, www.marxsyracuse.com) overlooks both downtown and Syracuse University. A weekend room for two is about $100 a night.</p>
        <p>In the Armory Square restaurant district, the Hawthorn Suites, 416 South Clinton Street (315-425-0500, www.hawthornsyracuse.com), has doubles for about $130 a night .</p>
        <p>At the Sheraton University Hotel &amp; Conference Center, 801 University Avenue, on the Syracuse University campus (800-395-2105, www.sheratonsyracuse.com), a standard room generally is about $159 to $189 a night.</p>
