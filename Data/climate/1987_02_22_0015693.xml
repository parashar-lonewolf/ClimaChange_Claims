        <p>LEAD: THE United States will start to run out of gas, many analysts agree, in as little as three decades.</p>
        <p>THE United States will start to run out of gas, many analysts agree, in as little as three decades.</p>
        <p>Last year, low oil prices brought a sharp drop in domestic production, putting the OPEC countries ''back in the driver's seat,'' according to Interior Secretary Donald P. Hodel. His prediction that ''people will be sitting in gas lines any time within the next two to five years'' has been widely challenged. For the longer term, however, few experts quarrel seriously with estimates that economically recoverable domestic supplies will be all but depleted by 2020, even if oil prices go up again and new oil is discovered. Extensive reserves would remain in the Middle East, Mr. Hodel and others say, but this country would have severe economic and national security problems.</p>
        <p>Experts in and out of the Government believe that, with the world oil market stable for now, the nation has a breathing space to prepare for scarce oil and rising prices. But there is sharp dispute over what preparations to make, a dispute rooted in different beliefs about the proper role of the Government.</p>
        <p>The Reagan Administration and its supporters believe that Federal meddling with prices and supplies caused the energy crisis of the early 1970s. So the Government has tried to remove obstacles to energy development on most Federal land, encouraged nuclear power and filled a 500-million-gallon strategic oil reserve. Otherwise it trusts to market forces to supply current and future energy needs.</p>
        <p>Environmental groups, some research organizations specializing in energy issues and some members of Congress contend that this attitude is creating a vacuum that will ill serve the nation. What the Government should do, these critics say, is to promote conservation of remaining coal and oil while developing renewable forms of energy. ''Pushing to develop oil to prop up the domestic oil industry makes no sense at this point,'' said Christopher Flavin, senior researcher for the Worldwatch Institute. ''We have to be dependent on a more diverse array of domestic sources and more energy efficiency.''</p>
        <p>Amory B. Lovins, research director of the Rocky Mountain Institute, a research group based in Colorado, said that if just two conservation measures of the 1970s - eliminating gas-guzzling automobiles and insulating dwellings adequately - were vigorously pursued today, the country could end its dependence on foreign supplies for much less than it would cost to develop frontier oilfields.</p>
        <p>But the tax credit for home energy conservation expenditures was ended at the beginning of 1986. A study group headed by Vice President Bush recommended in December that fuel economy standards for new cars be abolished. The month before, President Reagan vetoed a bill requiring manfacturers to build appliances that conserve electricity, because it ''intrudes unduly on the free market.'' Last week the Senate passed a similar bill again, and if the House goes along, as expected, Administration sources say the President may not veto it this time.</p>
        <p>There is no Administration softening, however, toward the import fees or taxes on foreign oil that have been proposed by some conservationists, legislators from hard-hit oil-producing states and some oil companies. Mr. Hodel, a former Energy Secretary, said, ''This Administration believes that the Government fails miserably when it tries to guide the price of energy.''</p>
        <p>If the Government really wanted to encourage domestic production, said Leonard Bower, director of policy analysis for the American Petroleum Institute, it would remove the windfall profits tax on oil. And Mr. Bower thinks the Administration ought to move more expeditiously to open up Federal lands and offshore areas to development, contending that past performance shows oil drilling need not harm sensitive areas. But environmentalists contend that Administration efforts to squeeze oil and coal from Federal lands will needlessly but permanently devastate the Arctic National Wildlife Range in Alaska and the California coast.</p>
        <p>While they believe an adequate conservation program would make such drilling unnecessary, the Administration's critics also call for Government subsidies for development of alternative energy sources, such as solar and wind power, or fuels like methanol that can be made from grain or from waste products. Thousands of private projects exist, but they lack the capital to become a national force on the energy scene.</p>
        <p>The Administration opposes Federal spending to expand such efforts, Mr. Hodel said, ''because the power to subsidize is the power to destroy'' - if the Government backed one energy source with a subsidy, it could destroy the competitiveness of an unsubsidized source. While support for research is proper for the Government, Mr. Hodel said, ''I don't want our guys spending big money on demonstration projects.'' Officials do not make good businessmen, he said, ''because their own money is not at risk.''</p>
        <p>Tina Hobson, executive director of the Fund for Renewable Energy and the Environment, said that the United States once had the lead in photovoltaic technology, which generates electricity with solar energy, but now trails far behind Japan. ''It is almost surreal,'' she said, ''to hear the Secretary of the Interior talk about drilling in national wildlife refuges and offshore, when we could solve our problems by investing a fraction of what we spend on Star Wars in research and development of renewable sources of energy.''</p>
