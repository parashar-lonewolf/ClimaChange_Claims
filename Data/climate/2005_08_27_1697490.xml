        <p>U.A.W. President Suggests a Pay Reduction For Chief Executive of General Motors  Rick Wagoner, the chief executive of General Motors, should take a pay cut as part of any deal for the United Automobile Workers to make concessions to help the company return to profitability, the union's president, Ron Gettelfinger, left, said yesterday. The automaker, which expects its health care costs to total nearly $6 billion this year, has been in talks with the U.A.W. since April to try to pare some of the union medical benefits that Mr. Wagoner blames for hurting its ability to compete with Asian rivals. The union has also told G.M. that it wants the carmaker to take back as many as 7,000 workers from the Delphi Corporation as part of three-way talks aimed at helping Delphi improve its financial situation. Delphi, which was spun off by G.M. in 1999, employs about 24,000 U.A.W. members. A G.M. spokesman, Stefan Weinmann, said he was unable to comment on whether compensation for Mr. Wagoner and other executives had been discussed in G.M.'s negotiations with the U.A.W. (Reuters)</p>
        <p>Precision Castparts to Buy Special Metals  The Precision Castparts Corporation said yesterday that it would buy the privately held Special Metals Corporation for about $540 million in cash. Special Metals, which emerged from bankruptcy two years ago, had revenue of $474 million in the first six months of the year, with operating profit of $26.5 million. Based in Huntington, W.Va., it is a leading producer of high-performance nickel-based alloys, which Precision Castparts uses in many of its forged jet engine and industrial turbine products. (Reuters)</p>
        <p>D&amp;M Holdings to Leave Portable Digital Player Market  D&amp;M Holdings, the Japanese maker of the premium audio-electronics brands Denon, Marantz and McIntosh, said yesterday that it would exit the market for portable digital audio players, because poor sales of its Rio line were a drag on the bottom line. D&amp;M said it would stop making the pocket-size music players by Sept. 30. D&amp;M, which is 51.6 percent owned by RHJ International, a holding company linked to the buyout firm Ripplewood, will retain the Rio brand and trademark and will continue to provide service and sales support to retailers and customers of its Rio brand. D&amp;M reported yesterday that its net loss widened to 717 million yen ($6.5 million) for the first quarter ended June 30, from 530 million yen in the period a year ago. Sales fell to 18.75 billion yen, from 19.22 billion yen. (Reuters)</p>
        <p>British Economy Expanded Faster Than Expected  The economy of Britain expanded 0.5 percent in the second quarter, a faster clip than initially estimated, even though consumer spending rose at its slowest pace in a decade, a government report showed yesterday. Analysts warned that the results could cause the Bank of England to hold back on any further interest rate cuts. Earlier this month, the central bank lowered its benchmark rate to 4.5 percent, the first cut in two years. (AP)</p>
        <p>S.E.C. Starts Formal Inquiry Into Immucor  Immucor, which makes blood-test products, said the Securities and Exchange Commission had stepped up its investigation into payments made by the company's Italian unit to people with ties to government medical facilities. The agency elevated its informal inquiry to a formal investigation, Immucor said, a legal move allowing the commission to compel testimony and subpoena documents. The investigation began after Immucor reported a violation of requirements under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the company, which is based in Norcross, Ga., said in a statement. Under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the S.E.C. can punish a company with United States-traded shares that pays bribes to secure business in other countries. (Bloomberg News)</p>
        <p>Hyundai to Add a Sport Utility Vehicle and a Wagon  The Hyundai Motor Company of South Korea said yesterday that it would not sell a minivan in the United States. Instead the company plans to add a seven-passenger sport utility vehicle that is larger than its Tucson and Santa Fe models in late 2006, and a large wagonlike utility vehicle about two years later. Hyundai, based in Seoul, more than doubled its United States sales in the last five years and plans to sell 485,000 cars and light trucks this year, a 16 percent increase from 2004. (Bloomberg News)</p>
        <p>Spain Plans to Reduce Dependence on Coal and Oil  Spain approved a five-year 23.6 billion euro ($29 billion) plan yesterday to increase the use of renewable energy. The country is seeking to reduce its dependence on coal to cut pollution levels and limit its exposure to oil prices. The plan, which runs through 2010, aims for renewable energy to produce 12.1 percent of the total demanded by then, the Industry Ministry said in an e-mailed statement. With the new plan, Spain wants to reach 20,155 megawatts of wind energy capacity in five years, compared with a previous goal of 13,000 megawatts. The government will finance 2.9 percent of the plan and the rest will be financed by companies, the statement said. (Bloomberg News)</p>
        <p>Eaton Offers to Acquire Domnick Hunter  The Eaton Corporation made a bid yesterday for Domnick Hunter of Britain, challenging an offer from the Parker Hannifin Corporation for control of the company, which makes filters and has a growing business protecting against biochemical weapons. Eaton offered £242 million ($436 million) for Domnick Hunter. Parker Hannifin had offered £232 million ($418 million). Domnick Hunter, which had sales of $280 million last year, did not comment. (Reuters)</p>
        <p>Earnings Soar at Royal Bank of Canada  Third-quarter profit at Royal Bank of Canada jumped 32 percent, driven by domestic banking and capital markets operations, the bank said yesterday. Net income at the bank, based in Toronto, rose to 979 million Canadian dollars ($816 million), or 1.48 Canadian dollars a share, in the three months ended July 31, from 743 million Canadian dollars, or 1.12 a share. Analysts had expected the bank to earn 1.42 Canadian dollars a share. (Reuters)</p>
