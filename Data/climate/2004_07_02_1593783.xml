        <p>A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy movies playing this weekend in New York City. * denotes a highly recommended film. Ratings and running times are in parentheses.</p>
        <p>Now Playing</p>
        <p>''AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS.'' Starring Jackie Chan and Steve Coogan. Directed by Frank Coraci (PG, 125 minutes). Sometimes nonsense makes good sense. The latest remake of Jules Verne's 1873 globetrotting fantasy is a deliriously silly caper that goes out of its way to thumb its nose at logic. This swatch of epic slapstick, in which three madcap adventurers from London play beat-the-clock in a race to circle the earth, is really a silent comedy with spoken subtitles. What distinguishes this rendition from the nearly three-hour 1956 version, which won the Oscar for best picture, is the presence of that coiled human whirlwind Jackie Chan. As Passepartout, the loyal valet to the fanatical British inventor Phileas Fogg (Mr. Coogan), Mr. Chan makes his entrance diving out of a window in a Keystone Kops-style chase. The whiz-bang set pieces in which he fends off teams of assailants in exotic locales are the movie's high points. The film's witty Rube Goldberg-worthy contraptions remind us that until today's high-tech environment, machines used to be funny. It is refreshing and perhaps even useful to see a movie that shows how susceptible to breakdown they really are. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Kathy Bates put in amusing cameos (Stephen Holden).</p>

        <p>''THE CHRONICLES OF RIDDICK.'' Starring Vin Diesel. Written and directed by David Twohy (PG-13, 115 minutes). The concentration of synthetic hormones pumping through the vascular system of ''The Chronicles of Riddick'' matches any recent action-adventure movie in the sheer density of steroids per liter of body fluid. In bodybuilding terms this overmuscled sequel to ''Pitch Black'' is all bulk and no definition. In touch with the grunting, preening culture of professional wrestling, the negligible screenplay by Mr. Twohy, who directed both movies, is crammed with trailer-ready tag lines. Intoned by Mr. Diesel with a sly comic gravity, these enigmatic blurbs mean next to nothing. Returning from ''Pitch Black,'' Mr. Diesel's character, Riddick, a fugitive from a distant planet and pursued across the universe by bounty hunters, might be described as the heavy-metal version of Brad Pitt's Achilles in ''Troy.'' Here he runs afoul of the Necromongers, an evil race of conquerors. The movie is all about nonstop action, computer-generated spectacle and sanitized sadomasochism, edited into one big roaring whir (Holden).</p>
        <p>''THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW,'' starring Dennis Quaid and Jake Gyllenhaal. Directed by Roland Emmerich (PG-13, 117 minutes). Tornadoes in Los Angeles. Hail in Tokyo. The entire Northern Hemisphere encased in a sheet of ice, with uncountable casualties, including life as we know it. All of which adds up, in the hands of Mr. Emmerich, to a sprawling, oddly lighthearted action picture. The computer-generated special effects are awesome, though not in the traditional sense of the word. As you watch cities obliterated by wind, water and ice, you don't think, ''My God, how horrible''; you think, ''Cool!'' The only one who seems genuinely worried is Mr. Quaid, playing a scientist whose apocalyptic warnings are ignored until it's too late. He sets out to find his son (Mr. Gyllenhaal), who is stranded at the New York Public Library and who seems, all in all, pretty relaxed. Like most disaster films, this one is ultimately more soothing than alarming, which may undermine its supposed ambition to raise awareness about the perils of climate change (A. O. Scott).</p>
        <p>''DODGEBALL: A TRUE UNDERDOG STORY.'' Starring Vince Vaughn and Ben Stiller. Directed and written by Rawson Marshall Thurber (PG-13, 96 minutes). Mr. Stiller returns to the comedy crime scene to portray a monstrous, pumped-up fitness guru and hilarious variation of Derek Zoolander, the airheaded male model he played with pursed-lipped, vacant-eyed perfection three years (and many dull movies) ago. His new character, White Goodman, a preening product of fanatical self-improvement, wears a blow-dried mullet and a Fu Manchu mustache and favors hideous white leisure suits. Affecting the pseudo-macho bark of a drill instructor, he suggests Anthony Robbins as a shrimpy, steroid-enhanced gym rat. White and his robotic cronies represent the Goliath that Peter La Fleur (Mr. Vaughn), the slobby, nice guy who owns a nearby low-rent gym, sets out to slay with the help of his nerdy pals who form a dodgeball team to compete for a $50,000 first prize in a Las Vegas tournament. The sports comedy is very dumb and often very funny (Holden).</p>
        <p>* ''FACING WINDOWS.'' Starring Giovanna Mezzogiorno, Massimo Girotti and Raoul Bova. Directed by Ferzan Ozpetek (R, 106 minutes; in Italian, with English subtitles). This lush, surreally flavored immersion in voyeurism and romantic dreams muses on many of the same themes as Alfred Hitchcock's ''Rear Window'' and ''Vertigo,'' but from a more conventional emotional perspective. It seductively uses the image of beautiful strangers secretly and obsessively studying each other through opposite windows to reflect on two related romantic syndromes: the ''grass is always greener'' and the ''absence makes the heart grow fonder'' quandaries. Instead of encasing the characters in a Hitchcockian murder mystery, the film compares the fantasies of possible lovers (Ms. Mezzogiorno and Mr. Bova) to the romantic, six-decade-old memories of a mysterious octogenarian (Mr. Girotti), whose story gradually comes to focus. The movie swept the Italian equivalent of the Oscars in 2003 (Holden).</p>
        <p>* ''FAHRENHEIT 9/11.'' Written and directed by Michael Moore (R, 116 minutes). Mixing sober outrage with mischievous humor and blithely trampling the boundary between documentary and demagoguery, Mr. Moore takes wholesale aim at the Bush administration, whose tenure has been distinguished, in Mr. Moore's view, by unparalleled and unmitigated arrogance, mendacity and incompetence. Of course, your estimation of the movie will largely depend on whether you share his view, but this unabashedly partisan collage of interviews, archival video clips and Mr. Moore's trademark agitprop stunts is nonetheless his most disciplined and powerful film. Mr. Moore is a prodigious talker and a wily showman, but he is also a good listener, and when he visits his hometown, Flint, Mich., to speak to the mother of a marine killed in Iraq, the film achieves an eloquence that its most determined critics will have a hard time dismissing. The movie's cheap shots and inconsistencies may frustrate its admirers, but by now we should have learned to appreciate Mr. Moore for what he is. He is rarely subtle, often impolite, frequently tendentious and sometimes self-contradictory. He is also a credit to the Republic (Scott).</p>
        <p>''GARFIELD.'' With Breckin Meyer and Jennifer Love Hewitt. Directed by Peter Hewitt (PG, 93 minutes). Jim Davis's lazy, lasagna-loving cat has been plucked from the funny pages and turned into a computer-generated dancing blob with the voice of Bill Murray. Why anyone thought this was a good idea is beyond me, but the movie is at least short and relatively low-key. There are two equally pointless plots, one involving a dognapper (Stephen Tobolowsky), the other a romance between Garfield's owner, Jon (Mr. Meyer), and a cute veterinarian (Ms. Hewitt). Even the most devoted cat lovers will be better served by a plate of reheated lasagna and a nice nap (Scott).</p>
        <p>''HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN.'' Starring Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson. Directed by Alfonso Cuarón (PG, 136 minutes). Taking over the franchise from Chris Columbus, Mr. Cuarón injects this third Potter picture with a shadowy, sensual mood. The look is grainier and grimier, and the themes are a bit darker and more unsettling than those in ''The Sorcerer's Stone'' or ''The Chamber of Secrets.'' There is less Quidditch and more Snape (Alan Rickman), which is all to the good, as are the efforts of new cast members like Michael Gambon (taking over for Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore), Emma Thompson (as a batty divination teacher), David Thewlis (as the latest defense-against-the-dark-arts master) and Gary Oldman, who brings his adaptable villainy to the title role. The film's major weakness, sad to say, is Harry himself. Approaching adolescence, Mr. Radcliffe may also be reaching the limit of his range as an actor; he seems unable to summon the complex, volatile emotions that the story demands, with its notes of grief and rage amid the usual boarding-school intrigue. Still, Mr. Cuarón breathes some new life -- and a new sense of mystery -- into a series whose charms are in danger of declining (Scott).</p>
        <p>''THE HUNTING OF THE PRESIDENT.'' Directed by Harry Thomason and Nickolas Perry (Not rated, 89 minutes). This documentary takes us back to a simpler time: the late 1990's, when all Americans had to worry about was their president's sexual indiscretions. Mr. Thomason, is, of course, the celebrated friend of Bill Clinton who, as the producer of such Southern-fried situation comedies as ''Designing Women'' and ''Evening Shade,'' was Mr. Clinton's Hollywood connection. As such, he is hardly a dispassionate observer of what his film terms ''the 10-year campaign to destroy Bill Clinton'' on the part of conservative activists, though the film does dutifully scold Mr. Clinton for his infidelities. But mostly the film exists to document the vast, unethical lengths Mr. Clinton's enemies went to in hopes of discrediting him, with testimony from cable news regulars like James Carville and Paul Begala, as well as figures, like Susan McDougal, involved in the Whitewater investigations (Dave Kehr).</p>
        <p>''I'LL SLEEP WHEN I'M DEAD.'' Starring Clive Owen, Malcolm McDowell and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers. Directed by Mike Hodges (R, 102 minutes). Mr. Hodges's new film -- his ninth in 35 years -- has much in common with his first, the legendary ''Get Carter.'' This time, Mr. Owen plays Will, a self-exiled London underworld figure who returns home to avenge the death of his beloved younger brother (Mr. Rhys-Meyers), who killed himself after being raped by a prominent citizen (Mr. McDowell). The movie runs more on mood than on plot or psychology: the motives of the characters are at once too obvious and too obscure, and the storytelling is willfully oblique. But mood is Mr. Hodges's specialty, and few directors create such finely shaded atmospheres of longing, dread and grief. His chilly elegance and Mr. Owen's morose precision are balanced by touches of eccentric humor and by the vulgar warmth of the supporting performers, especially Jamie Foreman as the dead man's best friend, who becomes Will's unlikely sidekick (Scott).</p>
        <p>''KAENA: THE PROPHECY.'' With the voices of Kirsten Dunst and Anjelica Huston. Directed by Chris Delaporte (PG-13, 91 minutes). The first 3-D animated film from France, this outer-space fantasy, about a plucky teenage girl (Ms. Dunst in the English-language version) struggling to save her planet from destruction, is thick with distracting visual detail, to the point at which it is often hard to distinguish the characters from the digital underbrush. The plotting, too, is needlessly dense, which necessitates long, static sequences in which the characters fill one another in on the story and still manage to leave the viewer behind. A gallant effort, technically at least, but a fatally uninvolving movie (Kehr).</p>
        <p>''THE NOTEBOOK.'' Starring Ryan Gosling, Rachel McAdams, James Garner and Gena Rowlands. Directed by Nick Cassavetes (PG-3, 115 minutes). Young love -- the old-fashioned kind that flourished before the age of the hookup -- has always been one of the most challenging emotions to portray on the screen with any specificity. Beyond the smooches, sighs and adoring glances, how do you convey the reality of a shared, private paradise? In the strongest scenes of this screen adaptation of Nicholas Sparks's treacly best seller, Mr. Gosling and Ms. McAdams break through the barrier to evoke high-strung, slightly crazed teenagers plunging headlong into first love. Against your better judgment, you root for them to beat the odds against them. The romantic drama, which spans six decades, is told in flashback as Duke (Mr. Garner), a garrulous, ailing old codger in a comfortable nursing home, reads aloud excerpts of a love story to a woman (Ms. Rowlands) with Alzheimer's disease. As the movie seesaws between Seabrook, N.C., in the summer of 1940, when the young lovers in the story meet, and the present, it is deliberately (and annoyingly) coy as to who these oldsters might be. Gosh, could they be the same young couple, still in love, six decades later? (Holden).</p>
        <p>''SHREK 2,'' with the voices of Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, Antonio Banderas and Jennifer Saunders. Directed by Andrew Adamson, Kelly Asbury and Conrad Vernon (PG, 93 minutes). This sequel revives the raucous high spirits of its predecessor, with some new characters, jokes and satiric targets to compensate for the loss of novelty. Shrek (Mr. Myers) and Fiona (Ms. Diaz), now married, travel with Donkey (Mr. Murphy) to meet Shrek's in-laws, the king and queen of Far Far Away, which is to Hollywood what Duloc was to Disney in the first ''Shrek.'' There they contend with a scheming fairy godmother (Ms. Saunders) and a swashbuckling, scene-stealing Puss in Boots (Mr. Banderas). The animation has improved, and the cross-generational appeal -- slapstick and moralizing for the kids, cheekiness and pop music for the grown-ups -- is precisely calibrated and jauntily executed. Still, the cynicism of the enterprise leaves a bit of a sour taste. The movie is too timid to risk genuine ugliness, and too crude to try for real beauty (Scott).</p>
        <p>* ''SPIDER-MAN 2,'' starring Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco and Alfred Molina. Directed by Sam Raimi (PG-13, 110 minutes). This wonderfully vibrant entertainment -- surely one of the best comic-book movies ever -- reminds us that being a superhero is not all fun and games. The first hour is a pop art chronicle of suffering and indignity, as poor Peter Parker (Mr. Maguire) struggles with the loneliness and frustration of being an anonymous urban crime fighter. His powers are waning, he has lost the respect of the woman he loves, and even Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) seems a little disappointed in him. Meanwhile, a new supervillain, the tragic and terrifyng Doc Ock (Mr. Molina), rampages through New York on mechanical arms with minds of their own. There is plenty of noise and color, and some so-so special effects, but the real thrill comes from Mr. Raimi's devotion to his hero's complex, conflicted emotional life, and to the melancholy, grown-up love story that develops between Peter and MJ (Ms. Dunst), who comes into her own as a strong and decisive character, while still fulfilling the traditional comic-book girlfriend duties of screaming, getting kidnapped and being rescued (Scott).</p>
        <p>''THE STEPFORD WIVES.'' Starring Nicole Kidman and Glenn Close. Directed by Frank Oz (PG-13, 110 minutes). Less a remake than a full-scale re-engineering, this adaptation of Ira Levin's dry, efficient suburban gothic turns a dusty 70's thriller into a loud and shiny postmodern farce. The music, by David Arnold, is as dementedly campy as some of the performances, notably Ms. Close's as the robot matriarch of Stepford, Conn. Ms. Kidman plays Joanna Eberhart, a high-powered Manhattan television executive who retreats to Stepford after her career collapses and her marriage (to Matthew Broderick) threatens to do the same. Once there, she discovers that the town's women have all been turned into busty, cheerful automatons who exist to fulfill their husbands' every wish. The screenwriter Paul Rudnick's gags and one-liners are often sly and incisive, but the movie never lives up to its satiric potential, collapsing at the end into incoherence and wishy-washy, have-it-all sentimentality (Scott).</p>
        <p>* ''THE TERMINAL.'' Starring Tom Hanks. Directed by Steven Spielberg (PG-13, 128 minutes). Mr. Hanks plays Viktor Navorski, a traveler from a fictitious Eastern European country who spends a year stranded in the International Arrivals terminal at Kennedy Airport. What sounds like a nightmare turns out to be a soothing comic dream, thanks to Mr. Spielberg's playful virtuosity, and also to the talents of the cinematographer, Janusz Kaminski, who infuses the neutral, unwelcoming architecture of the airport with soft, radiant light. The story is a bit soft: Viktor is befriended by a motley group of airport workers, bedeviled by a Homeland Security apparatchik (Stanley Tucci) and beguiled by an unhappy flight attendant (Catherine Zeta-Jones). There is a bit too much easy sentiment and artificial sweetness, and Ms. Zeta-Jones's character is woefully underwritten. But these flaws cannot dispel the film's deep enchantment. Mr. Hanks, like Mr. Spielberg, has nothing left to prove, and the nuances lurking in his sly, genial performance emerge only in retrospect. Similarly, the movie's deepest engagement with some of the central anxieties of modern life can be found not in its plot but in its ambience. It is a visual tour de force that turns fear into optimism, loneliness into solidarity, and frustration into resourcefulness (Scott).</p>
        <p>''TIME OF THE WOLF.'' Starring Isabelle Huppert. Written and directed by Michael Haneke (Not rated, 114 minutes; in French, with English subtitles). In this minimalist disaster movie an unspecified ecological catastrophe has disrupted modern life, and some of the survivors, huddled together in a bleak corner of the French countryside, struggle to hold on to the trappings of civilization. Food and water are scarce, and so is kindness, which Mr. Haneke rations out with elegant sang-froid. The movie is rigorously harsh, and its view of human nature is as dark as the cinematography, which forces you to discern human features in twilight, deep fog and utter darkness. Ms. Huppert, who played the unhinged musician in Mr. Haneke's ''Piano Teacher,'' is a mother trying to protect her two children and her own sense of identity amid chaos and desperation. Mr. Haneke's formal control is impressive, but his steely resistance to sensationalism or sentimentality can be repellent. You may find yourself horrified and disturbed by this all-too-plausible nightmare -- and shamed by the thought that, in some parts of the world, it represents real life -- without being especially moved by it (Scott).</p>
        <p>''TWO BROTHERS.'' Starring Guy Pearce. Directed by Jean-Jacques Annaud (PG, 105 minutes). This family-friendly movie about two tiger cubs, Kumal and Sangha, growing up the jungle somewhere in French Indochina in the 1920's, is terribly hokey. But once you accept the anthropomorphic premise that a gentle pussycat lurks inside of the most ferocious tiger, the movie succeeds as an inspirational pastorale and passionate moral brief for animal rights and preservation. It also inveighs unequivocally against one culture's looting of another's historical treasures. The movie is not as gripping as the director's much-loved 1988 film, ''The Bear.'' But when it concentrates on its animal stars (each played by several tigers), it remains on solid ground. Mr. Pearce is a treasure-seeking marauder and a big game hunter who softens and considers abandoning his rapacious ways (Holden).</p>
        <p>''WHITE CHICKS.'' Starring Shawn Wayans and Marlon Wayans. Directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans (PG-13, 91 minutes). Most movies require some suspension of disbelief, but ''White Chicks,'' a comedy starring two of the Wayans brothers as African-American F.B.I. agents disguised as dippy white socialites for a weekend in the Hamptons, requires something more radical. A full frontal lobotomy might be a good place to start. The celebutantes they are impersonating, the Wilson sisters, are obviously based on Nikki and Paris Hilton, and dressed up in their white-girl drag, the Wayanses look as if they've just lumbered in from ''Dawn of the Dead.'' With rubber prosthetics making their faces all but immobile, and blue contact lenses that give them that much sought-after vacant-eyed zombie look, they are scarier than anything in ''Scary Movie'' and ''Scary Movie 2,'' the last two films in which, like this one, they starred under the direction of their elder brother (Kehr).</p>
