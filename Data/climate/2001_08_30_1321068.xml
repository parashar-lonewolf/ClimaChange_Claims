        <p>FROM the crest of a small mountain in Golden, Colo., Chris Allen thought green thoughts. ''People in Colorado have a great respect for the environment, and that's why we're here, preserving the site as closely as possible,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Allen and her husband, Stuart, hired Alexander Gorlin, a Manhattan society architect, who partly buried their five-bedroom, 12,000-square-foot compound into the mountain for natural cooling and insulation, then heated it with geothermal pumps.</p>
        <p>The house may sprawl, but it's trying to blend in. If the moss rock on the facades isn't exactly local,  ''at least the stone came from Wyoming,'' Ms. Allen said. ''That's close enough.'' Her voice echoed in the 900-square-foot living room with gaping 21-foot glass windows. She took issue with a recent magazine article claiming that only small houses can be green. ''I grew up in the 60's and 70's with all those concerns -- the geodesic domes, the solar panels -- then you mature and have a family, and you kind of modify some of the issues.''</p>
        <p>To include, for instance, a five-car garage.</p>
        <p>In Marin County, Calif., Sim Van der Ryn, an architect, has designed a home with walls made of rammed earth mixed with quarry waste. The lawn will be watered with runoff from showers and sinks. Green as it may be, the house, at 18,000 square feet, is as big as a corporate headquarters. ''I know there's a natural inconsistency,'' Mr. Van der Ryn said. ''I mean how can you be green at this size?''</p>
        <p>Decades after the first Earth Day dawned with the mantra ''small is beautiful,'' the environmental movement is facing growing pains on the home front. As trend-conscious architects and their clients start to think green, dedicated environmentalists are left to ponder the pros and cons of the 5,000-square-foot-plus home with a conservation agenda. These jolly green giants are live-in contradictions, touting the latest energy-efficient accessories like photovoltaic roof tiles while admitting indulgences like climate-controlled wine cellars and motorcade-size garages.</p>
        <p>''People think they're doing something good if they build their walls out of straw bale or rammed earth,'' said Daniel Chiras, who teaches courses on the environment and biology at the University of Denver. ''But if it's a 5,000-square-foot house, it has to be furnished, heated, cooled and maintained. That takes a lot of resources and energy. They're fooling themselves if they think that's O.K.''</p>
        <p>As being green goes mainstream, more homeowners want to participate but without sacrificing their amenities. More than anything, Americans value size. Today's average house is 2,305 square feet, compared with 1,500 square feet in 1970, according to the National Association of Home Builders. In the same period, the number of occupants per house has dwindled from 3.2 to 2.6. The environmentalist credo of living lightly on the land is clearly at odds with the reality of acquisitive homesteading.</p>
        <p>''People tell themselves that if they can afford a 10,000-square-foot house, then that's what they should have,'' said Mr. Chiras, who lives with his two children in a 2,400-square-foot house with walls made of packed tires and straw bales, and is the author of ''The Natural House: A Complete Guide to Healthy, Energy-Efficient, Environmental Homes'' (Chelsea Green Publishing, 2000). ''But I wonder if the earth can afford it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Who's to dictate what the right shade of green is? One or two green-tinged measures make most homeowners feel as if they're doing their part. Geothermal heating is especially fashionable; after installation costs of $3,000 to $5,000 more than conventional heaters, a typical geothermal system can save as much as $600 a year in heating bills. Architects -- increasingly those who do not even bill themselves as especially environmental -- are ready to oblige with a tempting selection of greenish features that help compensate for the grand scale.</p>
        <p>Judy and Joe Schocken are planning their dream retirement home, to be built alongside a stretch of multimillion-dollar lots fronting Lake Washington in Seattle. ''I'm a green-type person,'' Ms. Schocken said. ''We're trying to keep it small, but it keeps growing.'' The couple's 6,000-square-foot house will include one bedroom, three dining rooms and a private theater for their son, a filmmaker. The Schockens' architect, Jim Olson of Seattle, will use only sustainably harvested lumber, as did their neighbor, William H. Gates, whose 40,000-square-foot house was among the first large-scale homes to be built of salvaged wood.</p>
        <p>The Schockens also plan to install a roof planted with native grasses, wildflowers and herbs, Mr. Olson's signature feature. He expects the $50,000 roof to provide natural insulation while providing a minihabitat for worms, squirrels and birds, perhaps eagles. The grasses ''will send out oxygen into the atmosphere,'' Mr. Olson said.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, some people, including architects with environmental records like Will Bruder, Rick Joy and Michael Manfredi, say that bulk and green are simply incompatible. Adding green features to an overscale house is just a way ''to rationalize decadent expenditures and to let people sleep better at night,'' said Mr. Bruder, who prides himself on integrating the ecological and the technological in projects like the Phoenix Central Library, which has computer-operated solar shades.</p>
        <p>But there is no shortage of builders who say that big houses are the best showcase for the environmental cause. For them, the new wave of green behemoths helps overcome the lingering memory of undistinguished, if well-intentioned, eco-friendly homes from the 1970's loaded with clunky solar panels and creaky windmills.</p>
        <p>''We need to get past the Woodstock generation and the idea that green is just for hippies,'' said David Warner of Redhorse Constructors in San Rafael, Calif., which specializes in green construction. Green houses used to be known for inferior construction, and this contributed to their reputation of being dumpy, he said.</p>
        <p>But today's big green houses are far sleeker, with both streamlined photovoltaic roof tiles for electricity and solar water heaters integrated into the architecture. (A two-kilowatt photovoltaic system saves about $220 in electricity costs a year in Colorado and $310 per year in New York. A typical solar hot water system saves about $280 a year in Colorado and $400 in New York, according to Randy Udall, director of the nonprofit Community Office for Resource Efficiency, in Aspen.</p>
        <p>''If a guy with a home over 10,000 square feet who doesn't think of himself as green still decides to use photovoltaic power sources, I consider that a victory,'' Mr. Warner said.</p>
        <p>William McDononough of Charlottesville, Va., green architecture's most high-profile advocate, does not object. ''Sure it's possible to be big and green,'' he said. ''Size doesn't have to matter.'' As long as everything in the house is biodegradable or recyclable, he says, sheer mass might even provide unexpected benefits. ''Do you have a problem with Roman palazzos?'' he asked. With a little forethought, he said, big private houses, with all the trimmings, could be reincarnated as art museums or adoption agencies for homeless children.</p>
        <p>But the most energy-conscious communities are not counting on finding Medicis in their midst. They want to send a warning to mansion builders. In Marin County, the Building, Planning and Environmental Health Department is rewriting the building code to require that houses larger than 4,000 square feet incorporate green measures. In Aspen, Colo., where heated swimming pools and snow-melting machines use as much fuel as entire homes, the City Council and Pitkin County Commission formulated a code that requires people to pay a prorated fee ($10,000 for a 10,000-square-foot house) for consuming resources. One household paid $90,000 to compensate for the resources required to heat its swimming pool.</p>
        <p>In the 18 months since it began, the program, called the Renewable Energy Mitigation Fund, has collected more than $1.3 million in penalties. The money is to be used to install solar hot-water heaters at a housing project and energy-efficient lighting in a high school, among other projects. ''Our feeling is that it is no longer acceptable for a large house to sit on the land and guzzle resources,'' said Mr. Udall, who works with the council.</p>
        <p>As reluctant as environmentalists may be to relinquish the idea that smaller is better, they seem willing to accept the built-in contradictions of the giant green house as the price to be paid for assimilation into everyday life. ''You can't make black-and-white judgments about what's environmental and what's not,'' said Gail Lindsey, former chairwoman of the Committee on the Environment at the American Institute of Architects, in Washington. ''I met a man who shocked me by saying he took 10 showers a day. But he was using solar-heated water. So much is just about our perceptions.'' Just don't ask how often he puts the towels in the drier.</p>
