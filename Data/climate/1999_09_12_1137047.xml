        <p>AS we barrel toward the millennium, there's something bothering the writer and actor Don McKellar: the dearth of good, old-fashioned end-of-the world movies. Indeed, Mr. McKellar was so perturbed that he decided to make his own. The result, his feature-film directing debut, is cheekily titled ''Last Night,'' and opens Nov. 5.</p>
        <p>Modestly budgeted at $2 million, the movie, which was released in Mr. McKellar's native Canada in 1998, boasts none of the special effects that characterize films like ''Deep Impact'' and ''Armageddon,'' two blockbusters from last summer in which the earth was threatened. On the other hand, those films lack the intellectual and emotional heft of ''Last Night.''</p>
        <p>Most Americans are probably unfamiliar with Mr. McKellar. But in Canada, his work as an avant-garde playwright and actor had brought him to the attention of the Toronto independent film community. He was co-writer, with Francois Girard, of ''Thirty Two Short Films About Glenn Gould'' and ''The Red Violin''; he appeared as an actor in Atom Egoyan's widely acclaimed ''Exotica'' and more recently in David Cronenberg's ''Existenz.'' Like Mr. Cronenberg and Mr. Egoyan, Mr. McKellar brings a wry, offbeat sensibility to his work. And that quirkiness seems the perfect way to approach the imminent destruction of the planet in a post-modern age.</p>
        <p>Mr. McKellar, who is 36, had already made a short film, ''Blue,'' when he was approached in 1997 by Haut et Court, a French production company with the grand ambition of having 10 directors from 10 different countries make movies about the turn of the millennium. (Walter Salles of Brazil, Hal Hartley of the United States and Tsai Ming-Liang of Taiwan were among the other filmmakers selected.)</p>
        <p>''There was this strange, unnatural pressure on me,'' Mr. McKellar said by telephone from his home in Toronto. ''People kept asking when I would direct a full-length film, and this just seemed the right opportunity.''</p>
        <p>But he was so excited about his new project (he wrote the screenplay as well) that he forgot to ask if there were any guidelines. In fact, there were, but he learned of them only after his film was completed. ''I guess I disobeyed some of the rules,'' said Mr. McKellar, ''including the one that specified that the action was to take place on Dec. 31, 1999.''</p>
        <p>Instead, Mr. McKellar avoided setting his film on any particular date. He even went to some length to disguise Toronto, where the story takes place.</p>
        <p>''Last Night'' recounts how a random, though interconnected, group of ordinary Torontonians spends its final six hours on earth. At the film's center is Patrick, a snide, insular architect played by Mr. McKellar himself. After enjoying a final dinner with his parents (Roberta Maxwell and Robin Gammel) and sister (Sarah Polley), he retreats to his apartment to await the apocalypse alone. But his plans come a cropper when he finds Sandra (Sandra Oh), a complete stranger, despondent on his doorstep because she cannot get home to her husband before the world ends.</p>
        <p>Mr. McKellar is wary of calling his film science fiction, for these days the term connotes expensive, action-packed pictures. He hoped that by avoiding certain topics -- ones often dealt with in science fiction movies -- he could get his audience to focus on more important issues. As a result, ''Last Night'' never answers, or even poses, the question, ''Why?''</p>
        <p>''I would hope that on the last day, people would be beyond discussing the reason,'' Mr. McKellar said of his decision not to explain how the world is ending in his film. ''I didn't want people wondering what Bruce Willis would do under the circumstances.''</p>
        <p>Other factors also contributed to what some may see as a glaring omission.</p>
        <p>Mr. McKellar wanted to steer clear of blaming someone or something for the catastrophe, fearing that moralizing would dilute the content of his picture.</p>
        <p>''I didn't want to point a finger at corporations or the Chinese or global warming or something,'' he said.</p>
        <p>And so, rather than focus on the causes of the world's demise, Mr. McKellar has trained his lens on the disaster's human impact. ''It sounds very corny,'' he said, ''but the film is about living, and about allowing yourself to be open around others despite the restrictions.''</p>
        <p>The openness that Mr. McKellar refers to is a theme refined from his days on the stage, when his primary creative outlet was the Augusta Company, a theater collective with which he is still associated. ''I originally thought theater was going to be my profession,'' he said.</p>
        <p>During those years, the late 1980's and early 1990's, Mr. McKellar wore several hats simultaneously and began to think about the creative process in ways that would shape his future endeavors. ''It was there that I began to get these disciplines -- acting, writing, directing -- confused,'' he said. For the theater, Mr. McKellar advances an imagistic esthetic, but his foray into film required a shift to naturalism that he says better suits movies.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cronenberg, whose unconventional films have inspired Mr. McKellar, plays a supporting role in ''Last Night.'' He calls the movie ''quietly brilliant.'' Naturally, he has his own interpretation of the picture's message.</p>
        <p>''It has an eccentric emotional power that kind of sneaks up on you,'' Mr. Cronenberg said. ''If an American writes an end-of-the-world story, it's 'Armageddon'; Don's take is so innately human. It really deals with mortality in a way those others don't. They pretend to, but they don't.''</p>
        <p>Mortality is central to any film dealing with an apocalypse, of course. But for Mr. McKellar, the issue was more personal. He traces his fascination with the subject to his youth. ''I obsessed about the end of the world a lot when I was a child,'' he said. In those years, Mr. McKellar suffered from nightmares, and the destruction of the planet was a recurring theme. Once, he became so agitated that he ran from his parents' house to warn neighbors that the end was nigh. ''I thought I could do something,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''Last Night'' touches on that sort of domestic drama in scenes of family farewells and last-chance indulgences, recalling such films as ''On the Beach'' (1959) and ''Miracle Mile'' (1989). In those movies, the world ends in nuclear annihilation. Mr. McKellar laments the absence of such pictures today.</p>
        <p>''I hope my film resuscitates some of those themes,'' he said. ''Pictures like 'On the Beach' and 'Dr. Strangelove' meant a lot to me growing up, and I wanted to recapture the tone of those films.''</p>
        <p>To that end, Mr. McKellar, who will be the subject of a retrospective at the American Museum of the Moving Image on Oct. 23 and 24, has chosen to evoke the past. Though clearly set in the present -- cellular phones and computer chat rooms drive some of the action -- ''Last Night'' overflows with design elements from the 1960's and 70's. Cars like the A.M.C. Pacer, furniture made from plastic and garish clothes signal bygone times. Yet for Mr. McKellar, these things are symbols of the modern.</p>
        <p>''I think of it as retro-futurism,'' he said. ''And I find these items, which have an air of progress for me, heartbreaking in this context.''</p>
        <p>Musically, too, ''Last Night'' poaches from the past. The soundtrack mixes pop songs from the 70's with an orchestral score that recalls the 50's. The songs, like ''Takin' Care of Business,'' were in the air when Mr. McKellar was a child, and the associations remain important to him. ''They have an optimistic, pre-adolescent-angst quality for me,'' he said, only half-jokingly.</p>
        <p>For the score, Mr. McKellar relied on the husband-and-wife team of Alex Pauk and Alexina Louie, two Canadian composers. Though Mr. Pauk insists that he and Ms. Louie avoided imitating a specific style, he acknowledges that they drew on a ''vast pool of musical memories'' to create a score full of foreboding.</p>
        <p>''Don was quite actively involved in the scoring process,'' said Mr. Pauk. ''In some cases, he even dampened our romantic impulses for something more restrained. It's all about trying to extend the director's imagination in sound, not just mood supporting emotion.''</p>
        <p>Inevitably, all the characters in ''Last Night'' die by the end of the film. But Mr. McKellar sees them as valorous nonetheless.</p>
        <p>''There is a heroism to these people,'' he said. ''The kind of heroism it takes just to continue living.''</p>
