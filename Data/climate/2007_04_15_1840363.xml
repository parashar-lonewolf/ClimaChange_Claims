        <p>DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER was president and global warming was unheard of in 1960 when Congress authorized a massive storm-protection project for an 83-mile stretch of Long Island's South Shore, from Fire Island Inlet to Montauk Point.</p>
        <p>Now, after decades of false starts and shelved plans, the United States Army Corps of Engineers has completed a study for the project and is discussing alternatives for proceeding with a long list of government agencies.</p>
        <p>What may emerge would be the largest shoreline resculpturing project undertaken in this country, costing hundreds of millions of dollars yet still incapable of protecting barrier islands and the South Shore mainland from devastation should a monster hurricane strike, officials involved with the project say.</p>
        <p>The project would be designed to last for 50 years, and the Army Corps and others are grappling with how much they should factor in the rise in sea level projected by many experts because of global warming. Work would probably not begin until 2010, 50 years after it was first authorized.</p>
        <p>The study now looks only at water levels over the past century. But that may change, the corps said, and the study could be expanded to consider the environmental and economic impacts of a storm in the class of Hurricane Katrina and what is now seen as the higher probability of such a storm's striking Long Island.</p>
        <p>While building a towering seawall the entire 83-mile length would be all that could help in severe storms, no shoreline armoring is on the table. At its most aggressive limits, the project would move mountains of sand, build dune lines, broaden beaches, jigger with inlets and set policy for what to do when breaches open in the barrier islands.</p>
        <p>The plan will also most likely call for reinforcing houses and other structures in flood-prone areas, removing them or moving them to safer ground.</p>
        <p>All the efforts will be to reduce storm, erosion and flooding damage to tens of thousands of homes and businesses in a 71-square-mile area reaching as far inland as Montauk Highway and Sunrise Highway.</p>
        <p>Clifford S. Jones of the corps' New York district office, who is the reformulation project manager, said a yearlong process of reaching consensus on the best way forward had begun. He said the public would get its first inkling of what may be in store at meetings toward the end of this year or soon after.</p>
        <p>''We are winnowing down the alternatives to come up with something the corps, the state, the federal agencies, Suffolk County and the towns and villages can all agree on,'' Mr. Jones said. ''And that's going to be a huge effort.''</p>
        <p>The corps was accused of failing to build levees properly in New Orleans, where flooding and ruin after Katrina in 2005 have changed how the corps will proceed with future projects.</p>
        <p>Corps officials will seek broad public support and scrutiny of a final plan for Long Island's South Shore. They will also submit that plan and the studies supporting it to an outside agency, which has yet to be selected, for an independent technical review.</p>
        <p>The study -- formally the Fire Island to Montauk Point Reformulation Study (the ''reformulation'' is from a plan rejected in 1978) -- calculates impacts from postulated storms and hurricanes and the protection that a variety of projects could provide.</p>
        <p>The project area, entirely in Suffolk County, encompasses ocean and bay shores and some 70 percent of Long Island's ocean beaches. It includes the 26-mile Fire Island National Seashore and its summer communities; parts of the Towns of Babylon, Islip, Brookhaven, Southampton and East Hampton; and incorporated villages.</p>
        <p>On Fire Island, no plan can be approved without the consent of the Department of the Interior, the parent agency of the National Park Service and its Fire Island National Seashore. In the past, the corps, the Fire Island summer communities and the seashore have had very different views on what is best for the beaches.</p>
        <p>A ''vision statement'' that the seashore regards as a road map for any project calls for natural processes like shifting sand to be unimpeded as much as possible and for dune and long-term beach replenishment to be minimized. The seashore is also determined that no project be tailored to benefit property owners who want their houses protected.</p>
        <p>Michael T. Reynolds, the seashore superintendent, said ''there will be a variety of trade-offs that will need to be made, with winners and losers both.''</p>
        <p>The Fire Island Association, a property owners' group, will want assurances that the project will protect the beaches fronting summer communities. Doing that, it argues, will be cheaper than paying to remove houses.</p>
        <p>Traditionally the federal government pays about 65 percent of the cost of shoreline projects. The state, Suffolk County and local governments would split the rest.</p>
        <p>If agreement can be reached on what to do along the entire 83 miles of shore, another challenge will be financing, said Representative Timothy H. Bishop, a Democrat from Southampton.</p>
        <p>''That fight will be difficult,'' he said, ''and it's difficult to know what other fiscal realities we may be facing.'' Mr. Bishop said he did not expect an appropriation before 2010. ''If we're still in Iraq then, that may well have an impact,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Representative Steve Israel, a Democrat of Dix Hills, said he had assurances that the corps would release a preliminary draft by the end of 2007 and a proposed final action plan by the end of 2008.</p>
        <p>''We are beginning to see the light at the end of a 40-year tunnel,'' he said, ''but like all dark tunnels, you don't know what you have got until you come out.''</p>
