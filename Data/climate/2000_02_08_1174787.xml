        <p>At the very top of a rocky, wind-whipped ridge above this sprawling ski resort west of Yellowstone National Park stands a towering grove of ancient whitebark pine trees. They are one of the few living things that thrive in the harshness at such altitudes, and they produce a large nut that is rich in fat and critical to wildlife.</p>
        <p>There is mounting concern among biologists and other researchers, however, that global climate change may be creating conditions in and around the park that are inhospitable for the tree. If climate warming is the real, long-term phenomenon that many experts think it is, scientists believe it could set off a series of changes that could kill 90 percent or more of the whitebark pine trees and possibly compromise the future of the threatened grizzly bear.</p>
        <p>The whitebark pine produces cones with pea-size nuts that bears eat in the fall. ''Of all the vegetable foods in the ecosystem, whitebark pine is probably the most important,'' said Chuck Schwartz, leader of Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team, a federal agency responsible for protection of the bear. ''They are critical to the fall fattening process to get the bears through the winter.''</p>
        <p>The circumstances of the tree illustrate the breadth and complexity of the problems a warming climate could create for natural systems. And it underscores the challenges faced by scientists and parks officials as they try to preserve intricate ecosystems.</p>
        <p>The whitebark pine thrives at the top of the Yellowstone ecosystem, the last tree before the timberline on most of the mountain ranges in and around the park, in stands of a few acres to thousands of acres. The cones blossom in the trees' upper reaches and are fed on by many birds, including Clark's nutcracker, which take the nuts and each year stash tens of thousands of them in crevices in the craggy rocks or in the soil less than an inch deep. Red squirrels, meanwhile, bury nut-laden cones in the duff on the forest floor, heaps called middens, which concentrate the nuts in piles large enough to be nutritional for grizzly bears.</p>
        <p>With the arrival of fall, when the bears are voraciously feeding to build up a store of fat for winter, they travel to the high country to dig up the squirrel caches. Some experts believe the nuts are the source of as much as 40 percent of a bear's layer of winter fat, and research shows they are important for fertility.</p>
        <p>Humans have become an integral part of this ecological relationship between bear and tree. When the nut crop is poor, the bears search out alternative sources to tide them through the winter's sleep. Instead of climbing into the high country, they often head into low-lying areas inhabited by humans, where they find dog food, beehives full of honey, garbage -- and trouble.</p>
        <p>There is a correlation between poor nut production and grizzly bear mortality, experts say. More bears die from ''human induced'' causes -- for example, being shot -- when there are not enough nuts.</p>
        <p>''Pine nuts are more than a food,'' said Louisa Wilcox, project coordinator for the Sierra Club Grizzly Bear Ecosystem Project in Bozeman, Mont. ''They are a shield for bears against human-caused mortalities.''</p>
        <p>Because nutrition affects reproduction rates, a drop in nut production can also affect birthrates, lowering the number of new cubs.</p>
        <p>The exact number of bears in Yellowstone is not known, but is estimated at 200 to 400. So a modest increase in deaths could have serious effects.</p>
        <p>Enter the global warming factor and a disease that affects whitebark pines called European blister rust. The rust, a fungus brought over from Europe, was discovered in North America in 1906. Windborne spores spread through the whitebark pine forests, through Idaho and into Glacier National Park in northwestern Montana, where the disease has killed 43 percent of the whitebark pines, and will probably kill 90 percent of those remaining. Fortunately for the grizzlies in Glacier, there are other fall food sources, mainly huckleberries and thimbleberries. Berries are rare in Yellowstone.</p>
        <p>Blister rust, first noted in the park in 1948, is now present throughout Yellowstone. Until very recently, the disease was present at low levels and did not kill trees. The spread of rust is dependent on moisture. Fogbanks must envelop the trees for 48 hours for the rust to spread.</p>
        <p>Those conditions are common west of the Continental Divide, where warm, moist air flows inland from the Pacific Ocean. But those conditions stop as they bump into the wall of the northern Rockies. The east side of the divide, the Yellowstone side, is cooler and much drier.</p>
        <p>As the earth's temperature rises, the atmosphere can hold more moisture and becomes wetter as more water evaporates from the surface. Some scientists say that in general this is happening now, and research is under way in the park to determine whether it is happening there.</p>
        <p>Certainly, blister rust has been spreading in the southern part of the region in the past few years. ''We've seen increasing heavy infections over the last five years,'' said Roy Bergstrom, a forester on the Shoshone National Forest in Wyoming. ''Maybe we have two to three decades before it really spreads.''</p>
        <p>The orange fungus, which girdles the tree and kills branches, could virtually wipe out the nut crop. Just one in 10,000 trees are resistant. Because the whitebark pine is not commercially valuable, the United States Forest Service is not spending money for research or solutions to the rust problem. But some researchers are discussing a number of possible strategies, all admittedly long shots.</p>
        <p>One choice is to do nothing. That is the present strategy of the National Park Service, which has a natural regulation philosophy that allows nature to take its course.</p>
        <p>''If the disease spreads over hundreds of years, the tree will adapt,'' says John Varley, chief scientist for the park. But if the disease explodes in the next few years ''and it looks like 90 percent of the trees are going to die, it's conceivable we'll dial up the Forest Service and ask them for disease-resistant trees and plant them,'' he said. ''The trees are simply too important to this ecosystem.''</p>
        <p>If nothing is done and the trees die quickly, it could take 500 to 700 years for the groves to regenerate.</p>
        <p>There is talk of ''genetic bottlenecking'' -- waiting for the disease to run its course through some stands of whitebark pine in the southern part of the ecosystem, and then taking pollen from those that survive and using it to pollinate unaffected trees in other places. Some scientists are talking about taking pollen from resistant trees in Glacier or Idaho and doing the same thing. Another possibility, Mr. Bergstrom said, is to burn away areas around groves where trees have survived to create conditions favored by Clark's nutcracker for stashing nuts, a kind of natural replanting.</p>
        <p>Officials agree they cannot simply let the tree die out and plant the seeds of the survivors. ''If we wait till they're all gone, it could take a long time to replace them,'' said Ward McCaughey a research forester with the Forest Service in Bozeman. ''It takes 30 years for a tree to produce a cone, and 50 to 80 years to produce a usable crop of nuts.''</p>
        <p>Should even worst-case situations occur, biologists expect the bear to survive. ''The bears would not curl up and die,'' Mr. Schwartz said. ''They would find alternative food sources.''</p>
        <p>Others are not as sure. ''If it was just the nuts, they might be O.K.,'' Ms. Wilcox said. ''But it's not. When you tie in the loss of habitat from subdivisions, possible oil and gas leasing and other things, then the long-term survival of the bear is far less certain.''</p>
        <p>As scientists learn more about the complex ecology of species, they learn how much of the equation is well beyond the control of the managers. For example, another important grizzly bear food source is the army cutworm moth. The slate-gray moths flock to the meadows above the timberline, where they feed on the nectar of alpine flowers. They are also a critical source of fat for perhaps as many as a third of the park's grizzly bears, which overturn rocks to lick up the insects, as many as 40,000 per bear in a single day. The moths could take up some of the slack caused by a loss of pine nuts.</p>
        <p>In their larval stage, however, the cutworms live in wheat fields on the plains of Montana and perhaps as far afield as Kansas, where farmers consider them a pest. It is a paradox not lost on Mr. Schwartz. ''We're monitoring the number of moth sites and working diligently to understand this critical food source,'' he said. ''And people are working just as diligently to eliminate it as a pest.''</p>
        <p>A genetically modified seed that created a strain of wheat resistant to cutworm moths, he said, could do as much damage or more to the long-term viability of the grizzly as European blister rust. ''It makes it clear how the bears are tied to everything,'' Ms. Wilcox said. ''The ecosystem really has no boundaries.''</p>
