        <p>FIFTEEN species of birds found in New Jersey made the list. They would be better off if they hadn't.</p>
        <p>They were among 105 species singled out last week by the National Audubon Society because they are at risk of becoming endangered. That's up from 90 last year, the first time  the Audubon Society put together what it calls its Watchlist, an early-warning system to focus attention on at-risk birds.</p>
        <p>Other sponsors of the project are the Colorado Bird Observatory and Partners in Flight, a coalition of scientists and concerned citizens.</p>
        <p>''The list is designed to identify species that will benefit from preventative action, rather than last-minute crisis management,'' said Vincent Muehter, the Audubon Society's associate director of conservation.</p>
        <p>The biggest threat to birds on the list is loss of habitat because of humans' activities. Their conservation status is rated on a scale from 6 to 30 with 30 being the most at risk.</p>
        <p>In New Jersey, for example, the wood thrush, at right, scored 20 while the bobolink and the short-eared owl scored 19. (The illustrations come from ''A Field Guide to the Birds'' by Roger Tory Peterson.)</p>
        <p>Birders, both amateur and serious, can help researchers by signing up for Project Feeder Watch, a winter survey of birds that visit backyards in the United States. Materials cost $15. For information, call (800) 843-2473. Information about the Watchlist and Project Feeder Watch is also available through the Audubon Society's web site at www.audubon.org.</p>
        <p>GOLDEN-WINGED WARBLER  Vermivora chrysoptera  Conservation priority score: 25</p>
        <p>Threatened by breeding habitat due to reforestation of farmlands and increasing urbanization. They also face threats from two other species of birds: brown-headed cowbirds, which drive them from their nests, and blue-winged warblers, both because the species mate and because they compete for the same territory.</p>
        <p>SALT-MARCH SHARP-TAILED SPARROW  Ammodramus caudactus  Conservation priority score: 25</p>
        <p>Threatened by degradation of their habitat in saltwater marshes due to draining and diking for development.</p>
        <p>BLACK RAIL</p>
        <p>Laterallus jamaicensis  Conservation priority score: 24</p>
        <p>Threatened by the loss and degradation of its wetland habitat, due to draining of marshes, grazing, salt production and development. Inland populations are threatened by the elimination of marsh vegetation because of the use of agricultural herbicides.</p>
        <p>RED KNOT  Calidris canutus  Conservation priority score: 21</p>
        <p>Threatened by overharvesting of horseshoe crabs in Delaware Bay; the crabs' lay billions of eggs that provide a food supply that is critically important for the Red Knots' successful migration to arctic breeding grounds. Other threats include disturbances by humans and toxic accidents like oil spills.</p>
        <p>SEASIDE SPARROW  Ammodramus martimus  Conservation priority score: 21</p>
        <p>Threatened by the loss and degradation of its wetland habitat because off filling, draining, damming and polluting. In Northeast, preferred foraging habitat has been removed and replaced with vegation of low food value. Also vulnerable to attacks on nests by rodents.</p>
        <p>WORM-EATING WARBLER  Helmitheros vermivorus  Conservation priority score: 21</p>
        <p>Threatened by loss and degradation of habitat because of forest fragmentation. Vulnerable to harassment by cowbirds.</p>
        <p>BLACK-THROATED BLUE WARBLER  Dendroica caerulescens  Conservation priority score: 20</p>
        <p>Threatened by loss and degradation of forests used as breeding grounds and potentially by increased development in the dense tropical forests and woodlands of their Caribbean wintering grounds. Long-term climate changes linked to global warming are suspected as the cause of a decline in breeding productivity.</p>
        <p>PRAIRIE WARBLER  Dendroica discolor  Conservation priority score: 20</p>
        <p>Threatened by loss of its habitat due to development on breeding and wintering grounds. IN the Florida Keys, its mangrove swamp habitat is also vulnerable to hurricanes. In addition, brown-headed cowbirds harass the warblers and cause them to desert their nests.</p>
        <p>WOOD THRUSH  Hylocichla mustelina  Conservation priority score: 20</p>
        <p>Threatened by loss and fragmentation of forest habitat on breeding grounds, which has led to high rates of attacks on their nests by brown-head cowbirds. In addition, old growth forests have been lost on tropical breeding grounds. When the birds migrate, many die in collisions with windows and towers, especially in the southeast United States.</p>
        <p>AMERICAN BLACK DUCK  Anas rubripes  Conservation priority score: 19</p>
        <p>Threatened by loss of habitat, which is freshwater and brackish wetlands and marshes with emergent vegetation.</p>
        <p>BOBOLINK  Dolichony oryzivorus  Conservation priority score: 19</p>
        <p>Threatened by loss of habitat due to changing land-use practices, especially the decline of prairies and meadows. Nests at risk from flooding and harassment by brown-headed cowbirds.</p>
        <p>CHUCK-WILL'S-WIDOW  Caprimulgus carolinensis  Conservation priority score: 19</p>
        <p>Threatened by loss of forest habitats in breeding and wintering areas.</p>
        <p>KENTUCKY WARBLER  Oporornis formosus</p>
        <p>Conservation priority score: 19  Threatened by development's destruction of its of deciduous woodland habitat, attacks on its nests by cats raccoons and skunks, and possibly by deforestation of its tropical wintering grounds.</p>
        <p>SHORT-EARED OWL  Asio flammeus  Conservation priority score: 19</p>
        <p>Threatened by loss of open grassland habitat to agricultural use, grazing, housing and resort development and by reforestation of grassland habitat when farming is abandoned. Also vulnerable to attacks by skunks, feral cats and dogs, especially during nesting.</p>
        <p>RED-HEADED WOODPECKER  Melanerpes erythrocephalus  Conservation priority score: 18</p>
        <p>Threatened by loss of nesting and foraging habitat as dead trees are cut to create managed woodlots. Another potential problem is a limited winter food supply of acorns and beechnuts because of the logging of mature forests.</p>
