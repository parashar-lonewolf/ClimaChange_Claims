        <p>ENERGY conservation is important to Robert Wiedenmann Sr., a Wallingford contractor who lives in a passive-solar house heated by burning wood and by the sun. ''But I guess I'm a dying breed,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The Sunwood Development Corporation, the company he owns with his son, originally specialized in energy-efficient homes, ones with extra thick insulation and passive solar panels that trap the heat from sunlight.</p>
        <p>Lately, however, Sunwood's customers have shown little interest in conserving energy, choosing instead to put their money into fireplaces and kitchens rather than wall insulation or the greenhouse effect.</p>
        <p>And, Mr. Wiedenmann said, for the last two or three years those with the money have been going in big for central air-conditioning.</p>
        <p>The apparent disinterest in saving energy would be good news to the state's power companies, which simultaneously run energy conservation programs and marketing efforts to sell more electricity, if not for the shutdowns of all four of Connecticut's nuclear power plants this summer. That left the state with a serious shortage of generating capacity for the summer peak electric use.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, the summer was remarkably cool, cutting way down on air-conditioning. Brownouts and rolling blackouts, which the public was warned might occur, never happened.</p>
        <p>But the three Millstone nuclear reactors in Waterford and the Connecticut Yankee reactor in Haddam Neck, shut down for safety concerns by the Federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission, might remain closed through next summer and for years to come. The state's electric use, on the other hand, has risen steadily, year after year, hardly pausing for the recent recession.</p>
        <p>Some electricity conservation efforts are going on. The state is preparing to raise efficiency standards in the state building code for lighting, air-conditioning and other building systems, beginning next year. Utility companies continued their offers of economic incentives to builders and building owners to promote greater efficiency.</p>
        <p>These efforts have had some success. Fred Wajcs, manager of technical services for Northeast Utilities, estimated that the company, the state's largest, reduced demand by 400 to 500 megawatts through conservation since the 1970's.</p>
        <p>But the company fell short of its target of 600 megawatts, and Mr. Wajcs said it reached only about 25 percent of the new construction and major renovation projects.</p>
        <p>Although the reduced demand was helpful, it doesn't come close to making up the more than 3,000 megawatts of generating capacity from the four nuclear power plants that are closed.</p>
        <p>No one complains that the electric efficiency requirements in the state building code are hard to meet, because they aren't, and there is no outcry for stricter standards, even with the state's current power generating difficulties.</p>
        <p>''The building code is a minimum design standard,'' admitted Dan Tierney, a supervisor in the state building inspectors' office. But even if it isn't strict, it has helped save electricity, he said.</p>
        <p>Electricity demand peaks during the summer when air-conditioning pushes up power use. According to Northeast Utilities, Connecticut's highest daily use of electricity rose from 4,708 megawatts in 1985 to 5,658 in 1995, approximately a 20 percent increase in 10 years. What utility company officials feared most this summer was a prolonged heat wave -- a week or more of successive days in the 90's -- creating heavy use of air-conditioning, spiking power demand past their ability to supply it.</p>
        <p>The last such summer was 1991, when there were 31 days when temperatures reached 90 degrees or above at Bradley International Airport, according to the Northeast Regional Climate Center at Cornell University. Connecticut's power demand surged to record highs that summer, defying the economic recession that otherwise held power use level from 1989 to 1993.</p>
        <p>''There's no question that the peak loads keep going up,'' said Beryl Lyons, a spokeswoman for the State Department of Public Utility Control.</p>
        <p>Voluntary conservation may have helped reduce demand this summer, but not by much. Emmanuel S. Forde, a spokesman for Northeast Utilities, said Connecticut's use dropped from 27 to 26 percent of the total use in New England, which he attributed to customers responding to pleas to conserve.</p>
        <p>Frances Mayko, a spokeswoman for United Illuminating, which serves the New Haven and Bridgeport areas, says it is hard to tell if the company's customers are really cutting back. ''This summer's been cool, so it's hard to judge, but our sales are down so it may be that our customers are conserving,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The utility company's conservation and incentive programs are primarily aimed at new construction or major renovations in which a large commercial or apartment building is gutted.</p>
        <p>Dean Fiske, president of the New Haven Home Builders Association, said he participates in United Illuminating's home builder program. For exceeding building code standards for energy efficiency, his company receives rebates and his home buyers pay reduced electric rates. He said Northeast Utilities has a similar program.</p>
        <p>These programs date to the oil shortages of the 1970's, their aim being to lower the effects on electric rates from fluctuations in oil prices and supplies. There is no effort to reduce the long-term demand for electricity. To the contrary, the utility companies have marketing programs to sell more power.</p>
        <p>Nor has conservation been a priority for government. State and Federal support for energy conservation has virtually been eliminated, said John Ruckes, an analyst for the energy division of the state's Office of Policy and Management.</p>
        <p>Government and utility company officials and builders all argue that they didn't cause the public's disinterest in energy conservation.</p>
        <p>Ms. Lyons noted that business and society have steadily grown more dependent on technology, and that means higher electric demand. Over the last 10 years, she observed, there has been a huge proliferation in computers, answering machines, large-screen televisions and other electrical devices and appliances. ''As technology becomes more sophisticated, we become more dependent on electricity,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Electric power costs are only about 3 to 5 percent of the cost of running a commercial building, and  0.5 percent or less when salaries are included, so owners and tenants aren't concerned much about them. ''The biggest concerns for building owners are location and appearance,'' said Mr. Wajcs.</p>
        <p>''People don't see the benefit of 2-by-6 construction,'' said Mr. Fiske, referring to wall construction that adds two more inches of insulation than is required by the building code. ''We build what people want.''</p>
        <p>As the environmentally conscious Mr. Wiedenmann notes, ''For the time being, we seem to be heading in the other direction. More and more people are asking for central air-conditioning if they can afford it.''</p>
        <p>But he admitted that after buying his first air-conditioned car a few years ago, he now won't do without the feature.</p>
        <p>''Could we live without air-conditioning? Sure,'' said Mr. Wiedenmann. ''Would we choose to? No.''</p>
