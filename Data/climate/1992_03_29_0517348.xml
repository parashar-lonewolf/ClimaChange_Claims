        <p>"Talk About a Slogan for the Back-to-Basics 90's: Electrify!" (Technology, March 8) cites an example that debunks the "ecowatts" theory -- a high-efficiency natural-gas glass melter. Many many more could have been cited. The glass furnace will be 20 percent more efficient than conventional glass melters and 40 percent less expensive than electric equipment. It will also lower emissions of carbon dioxide -- all by direct use of natural gas.</p>
        <p>Although the ecowatts concept is simplistically appealing, it is critically flawed. Efficiency improvements and emissions reductions have been driven in large part by an entire new generation of gas equipment -- efficient residential furnaces, fast-food cooking equipment and industrial processes. Coming down the road is a gas heat pump that heats and cools homes for the lowest cost of any energy option. (Let's see ecowatts match that!)</p>
        <p>Electricity is important to America's future. And natural gas will be used in large volumes to produce it cleanly. But there is also a role for the direct use of clean, efficient gas. Unlike new power plants, gas is one resource that is economical and abundant in North America. STEPHEN D. BAN Chicago, March 11  The author is president and chief executive officer of the Gas Research Institute.</p>
