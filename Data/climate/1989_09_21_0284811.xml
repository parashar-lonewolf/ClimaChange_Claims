        <p>LEAD: In a striking shift of focus, the 3,400 delegates gathered here from 91 countries to discuss the world energy picture have one dominant concern: the environment. Price and supply, the traditional focus of energy suppliers, have almost been squeezed off the agenda.</p>
        <p>In a striking shift of focus, the 3,400 delegates gathered here from 91 countries to discuss the world energy picture have one dominant concern: the environment. Price and supply, the traditional focus of energy suppliers, have almost been squeezed off the agenda.</p>
        <p>The delegates represent some of the world's most prominent experts on oil, coal, natural gas, shale oil, hydroelectricity, nuclear power, photovoltaic power, solar thermal power and even peat moss. But in most of the 160 technical papers presented here, the dozens of panel discussions and the major addresses, the worry at this triennial event has shifted from oil embargoes and declining reserves of fossil fuels to urban smog, acid rain and, above all, global warming.</p>
        <p>The question, clearly, is no longer where the fuel will come from - one study released here noted a 30 percent increase in estimated oil reserves in the last three years - but how to use it safely.</p>
        <p>The producers have cause for worry. Industrial emissions of carbon dioxide, which scientists believe must be limited to slow global warming, could be 70 percent higher than current levels by 2020, assuming moderate economic growth, according to a major study released today by the World Energy Conference. Changes in the Atmosphere</p>
        <p>''It is unambiguous and beyond doubt that we are changing the composition of the atmosphere by a measurable and important amount,'' said Lord Marshall of Goring, chairman of Britain's Central Electric Generating Board,'' in a keynote address. The program includes an outline for a panel discussion on global warming, listing topics for discussion, but begins by saying, ''The existence of a greenhouse effect is not to be debated.''</p>
        <p>For such a huge group of energy suppliers to put price, supply and production technology in second place is surprising, many of those present said. John Wakeham, Britain's Secretary of State for Energy, contrasted the concern now with the belief by Western nations in the 1970's that oil and other fuels were dwindling. That, he said, ''has been revealed as a gloomy fantasy and one of the most spectacularly mistaken forecasts of recent history.''</p>
        <p>But even after the oil glut of 1986 drowned the talk of shortage, the talk did not shift to the environment. ''You would never have heard this three years ago,'' said Elihu Bergman, executive director of Americans for Energy Independence, a conservation organization based in Washington. ''This conference is symbolically legitimizing what we have known in the States: environmental policy is driving energy policy.''</p>
        <p>A speech by Lee M. Thomas, the former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, reinforced the point. Mr. Thomas detailed decisions ranging from handling of the wastes from oil drilling to requiring anti-pollution equipment on power plants that cast his agency in the role of making energy policy. In another speech, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney made a similar point. ''Environmental sensitivity and economic growth, fueled by energy, go hand in hand,'' he said. ''We no longer have the luxury of trying to have one without the other.'' Growth in Energy Use</p>
        <p>The carbon dioxide study, assembled by 30 experts from 18 countries and 9 international organizations, assumed only a small increase in each person's energy use over the period, but a near-doubling of the population in the third world, from 3.6 billion in 1985 to 6.3 billion in 2020.</p>
        <p>The conference also released a separate study hinting that the reserves of fossil fuels are plentiful. A triennial study of resources found that global recoverable reserves of hard coal are up 80 percent since 1986, oil reserves are up 30 percent and natural gas is up 14 percent.</p>
        <p>What was less clear than supply was where energy policy was being driven. Lord Marshall's prescription was nuclear power, a view that did not create a clear consensus here. Another conflict was between delegates from the third world and the developed countries over who would have to improve energy efficiency to minimize releases of carbon dioxide and other gases.</p>
        <p>Chauncey Starr, the founder and former president of the Electric Power Research Institute of Palo Alto, Calif., pointed out that each North American uses, on average, seven times as much energy as people of the third world. For ''a huge portion of the world population,'' he said, the primary concerns are ''food supply and enough fuel for cooking and warmth.'' If that population increases its energy consumption only modestly - 2.3 percent a year, Mr. Starr said - the combination of population growth and higher consumption would quadruple world energy demand in 75 years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Starr and others suggested investing in efficiency, especially in the third world; for example, Mr. Starr said, the efficiency of cooking over an open stove is 3 percent, versus 20 percent in a clay oven, a percentage increase far greater than that available in the industrial world.</p>
        <p>But that focus may be wrong, said another delegate, Jassim al-Gumer, director of the economics department at the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Counties, in Kuwait. ''They have such little to spend on pollution, or energy,'' he said of the nonindustrial countries. India, he said, uses a barrel of oil a year for each person, Brazil 3 and the United States 45. ''How much pollution is coming from the 45 barrels versus the one barrel?''</p>
        <p>For the developing countries that aspire to use more energy, limits on use to slow global warming seem unfair. ''Industrialized countries should recognize that they are to carry the lion's share of the total burden because they consume 80 percent of world energy resources,'' said Bong Suh Lee, the South Korean Minister of Energy Resources.</p>
        <p>More than unfair, it may be impossible, said the British Secretary of State for Energy, John Wakeham. In any international agreement to cut emissions from burning fossil fuels, he said, ''We have to recognize that some backs are broader than others; that costs that are an inconvenience in the developed countries may make the difference between life and death in the third world.'' Allocating the Burden</p>
        <p>But allocating the burden, experts said here, would be difficult. Speaking for the United States, W. Henson Moore, the Deputy Secretary of Energy, sounded distinctly unwilling to take too large a role, or to take substantial action before everyone else agreed. ''The good done by one country is offset by the increased damage done by another,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But the United States and the rest of the world would feel a substantial effect from third-world energy growth, according to the study on energy growth, ''Global Energy Perspectives 2000-2020.''</p>
        <p>Whether the level of carbon dioxide output represents an unrealistic constraint on the scenario painted by the study was not clear to the participants. Klaus Brendow, the director of the energy commission of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, noted that the scenario assumed that fossil fuels would provide about 80 percent of energy in 2020, down from 88 percent in 1985. ''The risks of a global warming resulting from such a bias are obvious,'' he said, calling for more research into renewable energy.</p>
        <p>The scenario established in the study predicted that with moderate economic growth, third world use of coal would triple between 1985 and 2020; use of oil would double, and use of natural gas would more than triple. Worldwide, the study said, coal use would be up by 51 percent, oil by 66 percent and natural gas by 58 percent.</p>
        <p>It also assumed that the use of nuclear power would more than triple, to account for 7 or 8 percent of energy supplies, compared with 4 now. An estimate by the organization in 1983 had put nuclear at 12 percent by 2020, but it was scaled back because construction has dropped off.</p>
