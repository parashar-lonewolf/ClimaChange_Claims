        <p>As the debate begins over the agreement to reduce global gas emissions, many Republicans sense that they have a political opportunity reminiscent of the health care fight of 1994.</p>
        <p>The country then supported the basic idea of health insurance for all, just as it now supports strong environmental action. But Republicans skewered the health plan on the details, and in the process painted President Clinton as a big-government liberal. Some now think they can repeat their success and this time tar Vice President Al Gore.</p>
        <p>Even if the Senate never ends up voting on the pact, Republicans are already testing arguments. Steve Forbes, a Republican Presidential contender, immediately called the accord ''an unprecedented government seizure of American freedom and sovereignty.'' He added that  ''the Clinton health care plan pales in comparison.''</p>
        <p>Jim Nicholson, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, said the pact will ''radically change the American life style.'' And Audrey Mullen, the executive director of the conservative group Americans for Tax Reform, said, ''Al Gore would prefer to stick working-class America with a big tax increase and stick America with lost jobs or seek the approval of his liberal environmentalist tree-hugging friends.''</p>
        <p>At the same time voices of caution in the party recognize that the Republicans have often fallen on the wrong side in the environmental debate and need to be very careful how they approach an issue on which Democrats have traditionally had a great public advantage. And some party members remember how ineffective President George Bush was when he went after Mr. Gore in 1992 on his environmental views, calling him ''Ozone Man.''</p>
        <p>''The Republican Party, as far as public perception is concerned, has not been a strong position to go toe to toe on the environment,'' said Tony Blankley, a former spokesman for Newt Gingrich, the Speaker of the House. He said that while he believed that the accord and the Vice President were vulnerable, it would require an extended, concerted effort to sway public opinion.</p>
        <p>The Republican opportunity is enhanced by division among the Democrats about the accord. It is supported by one core Democratic constituency -- environmentalists -- but has drawn significant opposition from the labor movement. This may be an issue where many Congressional Democrats stand back and let the Administration and the Republicans fight.</p>
        <p>Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House minority leader, who is considered a likely challenger to Mr. Gore in 2000, has been conspicuously silent about the agreement. His aides said he wanted to consult with members of his caucus. The Democratic delegation he sent to observe the Kyoto negotiations on global warming was split in its views.</p>
        <p>The Administration does not expect to move forward to seek Senate approval until 1999 at the earliest. That means that there is plenty of time for an array of interest groups to wage a campaign of lobbying, grass-roots organizing and television ads, much as they did during the health care debate.</p>
        <p>The question for the next year will be who will frame the debate for the American people.</p>
        <p>''What's important now is that this is a battle for definition as much as anything else,'' said Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic pollster. ''The issue of the treaty is completely undefined in the public mind and is in fact probably a new chapter in environmental politics.''</p>
        <p>Pollsters from both parties agree that the public right now is disposed to favor environmental measures.</p>
        <p>A New York Times Poll last month found that 65 percent of those polled said the United States should take steps to cut its emissions of greenhouse gases ''regardless of what other countries do.'' And a survey by the Pew Research Center last month found that a majority of Americans would even pay more for gasoline to reduce global warming.</p>
        <p>But most Americans also favored the idea of universal health care before its opponents swung into action in 1994, ridiculing the complexity of the President's bill and running the ''Harry and Louise'' television ads featuring a couple voicing doubts about the plan's details.</p>
        <p>White House officials say they learned lessons from that defeat that they are applying to global warming.</p>
        <p>In his White House appearance on Thursday, Mr. Gore moved immediately to take off the table two potent lines of attack by the Republicans: He said the Administration would not submit the accord to the Senate until developing nations agreed to take part in the global effort. And he said the Administration would use tax incentives, not tax increases, to encourage reductions in emissions of ''greenhouse gases'' that are blamed for global warming.</p>
        <p>''We were really clear about the words 'no taxes' on day one,'' a senior White House official said. ''It was totally off the table in the first day, really quickly, no fuzziness.''</p>
        <p>At the same time, White House officials said, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore now have a powerful record on the economy, which they lacked in 1994. Their record on job creation, they argue, will help inoculate the White House against charges that the emissions-reduction effort will hurt the economy.</p>
        <p>Finally, because the Senate will not actually receive the climate agreement until next year, there will not be actual legislation that can be picked apart. ''Without the legislation, the debate's about protecting the environment,'' a Clinton aide said hopefully.</p>
        <p>But Republicans are already working to reframe the issue as one of economic security and national sovereignty. This is a theme officials say can unite the Republicans' business base and economic populist faction -- and also tap into sentiment against global trade that surfaced when Mr. Clinton was defeated last month in his attempt to win expanded trade authority from Congress.</p>
        <p>As was the case in the health care debate, the Republicans are also expecting outside help. Using the same media team of Goddard-Claussen that produced the Harry and Louise ads, the Global Climate Coalition, an association of industry groups and some unions, has already run $13 million in television advertisements against the agreement.</p>
