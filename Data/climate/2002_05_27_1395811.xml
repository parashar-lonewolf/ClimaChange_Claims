      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Four years ago, when Raymond S. Petronko was running for a City Council seat here, he kept hearing one complaint from voters.</p>
        <p>''People kept asking me, what are you going to do about the geese?'' Councilman Petronko said. ''What are you going to do about the geese?''</p>
        <p>The Canada geese were all over town. They had taken over Spring Lake Park, reacting aggressively if anyone came near their nests. Their droppings made it impossible for children to play on the playgrounds or families to picnic on public grounds.</p>
        <p>Today, the problem is worse. Middlesex County, which owns Spring Lake Park, has tried spraying a chemical repellent throughout the park, but it did not work. In residential areas, the geese are attracted by the lush, carefully tended lawns of this central New Jersey community. Their feces, Mr. Petronko said, weighed down his swimming pool cover almost to collapse.</p>
        <p>Desperate, city officials say they are now considering applying for permits for more lethal ways to eradicate the geese from within their borders, a solution they had not wanted to try up to now.</p>
        <p>''It's an epidemic,'' Mr. Petronko said. ''You can't take your kids to the park, because they slip and fall on the droppings. The geese are not good neighbors.''</p>
        <p>It's no wonder South Plainfield thinks the Canada geese problem is growing worse. The resident population of Canada geese has exploded in North America in the last few years, particularly in New Jersey, where their numbers have doubled in the last decade. New Jersey has the densest population of resident Canada geese than any other state, 4.3 per square kilometer.</p>
        <p>The geese are damaging crops in farm fields, defecating in public areas, causing near collisions with aircraft around airports and contaminating water supplies. They are protected by federal environmental laws, and landowners have to apply to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service for permits to remove them from their property.</p>
        <p>But federal officials concede that efforts to control the Canada geese population all over the country are not working.</p>
        <p>''There are growing conflicts between humans and birds,'' said a spokesman for the Fish and Wildlife Service in Washington, Chris Tollefson. ''They are causing destruction of property and they create a nuisance. Because of their double-digit growth, they cause trouble for farmers, and they make parks and public places unusable by humans.''</p>
        <p>Overwhelmed by requests to do something, the agency has proposed new measures to streamline the permit process and to give states more control over their programs to manage the geese. Since April 1, they have been holding hearings all over the country to solicit public comment. What they are hearing is a lot of frustration from those who find themselves on the losing side of the war with the waterfowl.</p>
        <p>''I'm getting so sick and tired of what these beasts have done all over the nation,'' Leonard Baker, of Livingston, said at a hearing in New Brunswick on May 22. ''It's disgusting. We have a ballpark near where I live that can't even be used because it's constantly full of goose droppings. If the children go anywhere near them, they attack them. We have a small lake that can't be used anymore.''</p>
        <p>Traditionally a migratory bird, more and more Canada geese are establishing resident populations within the 48 contiguous states, where they usually stay only during the fall, winter and spring months. The geese make themselves at home on the lawns and waterways of parks, golf courses, carefully plowed farms and even residences.</p>
        <p>At one time, communities welcomed the geese. In the 1950's and 1960's, federal wildlife officials said, wildlife agencies actively encouraged the growth of the species by relocating some resident geese along the Atlantic seaboard.</p>
        <p>Now, there is hardly a community that is free of the gray and brown birds with their elegant black necks and white markings underneath. They fly in a V formation, their boisterous honking marking their arrival at lakes, open lawns and farm fields.</p>
        <p>The United States Fish and Wildlife Service estimates there are 3.6 million resident Canada geese in the United States and Canada, including 1.1 million in the Atlantic Flyway, the area from Georgia north to Canada. In 1990, there were about 200,000 in that stretch, federal wildlife officials said.</p>
        <p>In New Jersey, their numbers have doubled since 1992, to 96,828 in the latest count this spring.</p>
        <p>Landowners who want to get rid of resident geese can apply to the Fish and Wildlife Service for one of four types of permits. The permits allow the birds to be captured and relocated; trapped and killed -- usually by suffocation; to be hunted during certain times of the year, or to have their eggs shaken to keep embryos from forming.</p>
        <p>The relocation permit is the least popular because it is hard to find other communities that want the geese, said Diane Pence, chief of the Division of Migratory Birds for the Northeast Region of Fish and Wildlife, which includes New Jersey and New York.</p>
        <p>Some communities apply for the permits to ''addle'' goose eggs, and hire companies with workers trained in how to shake the eggs. Others apply vegetable oil to the eggs, to keep oxygen from reaching the embryo. While there is conflicting evidence about how effective addling is as population control, some landowners prefer this to lethal methods. Ms. Pence said that if eggs are removed from the nests, the birds merely lay more to replace them.</p>
        <p>This year the Fish and Wildlife Service issued 49 permits that allowed geese to be trapped and killed in New Jersey, usually through suffocation with carbon dioxide. A total of 10,720 geese have been captured, up from 1,169 birds and 10 permits in 2000, Ms. Pence said. Hunting permits are issued only at certain times of the year and not in densely populated areas.</p>
        <p>Many people who attended the hearing in New Brunswick complained that it takes too long to get a permit, sometimes up to three months. In their proposal to streamline the process, federal officials say, they want to pass more authority to state agencies to allow them to monitor and control Canada geese populations, instead of leaving it to individual landowners applying to the federal offices. They also propose expanding hunting opportunities.</p>
        <p>But not everyone approved of more aggressive methods to trim the geese population.</p>
        <p>''I must ask, if the geese are slaughtered, what animal could be the next victim?'' asked Bari Feinstein, a representative of the New Jersey chapter of the Coalition to Prevent the Destruction of Canada Geese. ''What are we teaching our children, that problems can only be solved by bloodshed, instead of teaching them compassion and respect for all living things?''</p>
        <p>Like many other animal rights advocates in the crowd, Ms. Feinstein said she encouraged the federal agency to explore more nonlethal, humane methods of control, including using border collies or turf repellent to keep the geese off lawns and parkland. But others, like Mr. Petronko from South Plainfield, said the problem went beyond that.</p>
        <p>''Too much time has been spent studying this,'' he said at the hearing. ''Until you train Canada geese how to use a kitty litter box, I'm in favor of doing something else to get rid of them.''</p>
