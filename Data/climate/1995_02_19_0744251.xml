        <p>Tenants of a building in Brooklynwho were forced out of their homes for two nights by poisonous gas from an underground cable fire in the street were allowed to return yesterday after the city's Department of Environmental Protection found that the air in the building had cleared.</p>
        <p>A 60-year-old woman died of a heart attack after the evacuation Thursday morning at 1010 President Street in Crown Heights. Two of the 24 residents from the four-story building remained hospitalized yesterday, still suffering from the effects of carbon monoxide poisoning.</p>
        <p>The Commissioner of Environmental Protection, Marilyn Gelber, said in a telephone interview yesterday afternoon that she had just left the President Street site. "We just gave the all clear so that tenants can reoccupy," she said of the 40 families from the building who had been housed by the Red Cross in a hotel or had been staying with friends and relatives.</p>
        <p>"We will continue to be there, in our command center, throughout the night," Commissioner Gelber said, "to continue to monitor to make sure that no unusual readings reoccur, and also to answer questions and allay the fears of the residents."</p>
        <p>A full investigation of the cause of the fire and the source of the carbon monoxide will begin tomorrow. But from a preliminary investigation, Ms. Gelber said, "It would appear to be, at this point, attributable to burning cable insulation and the wooden encasement around the cable" in the underground service box in the street. "This was uncovered last evening," Ms. Gelber said. "That wooden encasement has been removed along with the cable. Upon removal, the levels went down dramatically." The Commissioner explained that the usual byproduct of a fire is carbon dioxide. "That is because air is typically present," she said. "In this case, apparently, there was little air because this occurred underground. So there was not sufficient oxygen for there to be carbon dioxide formed and, rather, because of the lack of air, it was carbon monoxide that formed."</p>
