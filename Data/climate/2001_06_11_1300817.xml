        <p>''The Mirage of a Growing Fuel Supply,'' by Evar D. Nering (Op-Ed, June 4), shows mathematically that a compounded growth rate in our use of finite fossil fuels cannot be sustained. However, I disagree that extracting more oil will ''leave our descendants in an impoverished world.'' Energy from fossil fuel is finite, but renewable forms of energy from the sun are not.  Well before we exhaust fossil fuels, their rising prices will gradually lead us to renewable energy.</p>

        <p>Policy can encourage this, but we must allow time for the necessary cost-reducing technologies to blossom in order to avoid a wrenching blow to the quality-of-life aspirations of the world's growing populations.</p>
