        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Nuclear power's unsolved spent-fuel problem disqualifies it as a responsible person's energy solution.</p>
        <p>Multiplying fuel dumps from a nuclear ramp-up would become an inheritance just as unwanted as coal's atmospheric impact.</p>
        <p>Nicholas D. Kristof should concentrate his fire on insincere regulation of consumption.</p>
        <p>President Bush wants a perpetual hunt for new sources amid conservation efforts that amount to little more than moralistic abjurations.</p>
        <p>The world is striving for economic parity, implying a vast increase in greenhouse emissions or an unpalatable proliferation of nuclear capability. An America of mandated conservation, imposing taxes (at meaningful levels) on the full panoply of emitters and related culprits (family cars, fast food, tract houses and discount boxes in cornfields) would set a standard to which the rest of the world might reasonably respond.</p>
        <p>Or America can keep on behaving like an addict, its house strewn with dead soldiers.</p>
