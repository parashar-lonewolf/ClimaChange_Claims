        <p>LEAD: Last week, Sunday morning's longest running public-affairs programs targeted a typically timely assortment of issues, with seasoned reporters bearding more and less forthcoming officials and experts.

        <p>Last week, Sunday morning's longest running public-affairs programs targeted a typically timely assortment of issues, with seasoned reporters bearding more and less forthcoming officials and experts. Meeting the press on NBC was William Reilly, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. On CBS, the nation was faced with the dangers of Iraq's suspected efforts to develop a nuclear bomb, and David Brinkley and his cohort, on ABC, offered a somewhat broader approach to the same subject.</p>
        <p>Loyal viewers must by now take these forums of public enlightenment and controversy for granted, but the Sunday-morning phenomena deserve periodic recognition for a useful job that is little honored by the commercial channels on prime time. The line-up has come to be known as television's news ghetto, but it is more like a gentrified neighborhood cut out of the weeknight slums. Along with the current-affairs programs already mentioned, between 9 A.M. and noon, CBS also offers ''Sunday Morning'' and ''The Wall Street Journal Report''; NBC has ''Sunday Today,'' ''The McLaughlin Group'' and ''News Forum''; on ABC there's ''Business World,'' and on CNN, ''Newsmaker Sunday.'' A news junkie could overdose before going to church, and fans of the form might wish that such programs were spread through the week, to join the lonely ''MacNeil/Lehrer Newshour'' on public TV and ABC's ''Nightline.''</p>
        <p>But let's take a more positive view. Sunday morning has come to resemble one of those classy streets in foreign cities on which almost every store sells expensive watches or high-priced handbags: an attraction for browsers as well as for serious buyers. About 3.6 million people tune into ''This Week With David Brinkley'' of a Sunday; almost 3 million to ''Face the Nation'' and 2.6 million to ''Meet the Press.''</p>
        <p>A particular pleasure on all three programs is being able actually to watch the ducking and dodging of the personages for whom the guest-hunters compete. That is one of the benefits of transposing to the tube what began as radio programs.It's a sort of Sunday-morning football. Lesley Stahl, who manages ''Face the Nation,'' has developed into a admirably persistent questioner who doesn't mind being a touch offensive in the interests of dredging forth a comprehensible answer from a reluctant biggie. Some weeks ago, after trying without much success to get the Israeli hard-liner Ariel Sharon to give details of how he would go about negotiating with the Palestinians, she told him that it seemed to her he was opposed to any talks. Although Mr. Sharon still did not oblige with specifics of his plan for handling things, he seemed somewhat discomfited, which in these encounters is half the battle.</p>
        <p>Sitting in for Ms. Stahl last week, Bill Plante showed in his no-nonsense questioning of Iraq's Deputy Foreign Minister Nizar Hamdoon that a male reporter can be just as tough as a woman.</p>
        <p>Rest assured, office holders and politicians have learned to use the programs to promote themselves and their causes. One Sunday last month, Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, appeared on ''Face the Nation'' to advance his plan for balancing the Federal budget. That morning also found Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, on the Brinkley program and Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner on ''Meet the Press.'' They, too, had been in the news that week and had interests of their own to push.</p>
        <p>The subtext on all the programs is who is using whom. On ''Meet the Press'' last Sunday, Elizabeth Drew and Robert Novak joined Garrick Utley in trying to cut through the fog dispersed by the E.P.A.'s Mr. Reilly over differences within the Administration on environmental policy; it was no easier than dealing with acid rain. Similarly, Ms. Stahl's attempts a few weeks ago to penetrate the smog surrounding Vice President Dan Quayle was not entirely successful.</p>
        <p>Mr. Utley, who oversees ''Meet the Press'' in businesslike manner, is generally joined by two other reporters, which sometimes seems about one too many for a half hour, especially since several minutes at the end are eaten up by the exchanges of the hosts and a bit of virtuous editorializing by Mr. Utley. That's particularly unfortunate because ''Meet the Press'' often goes for nonsexy but critical issues. On one recent outing, for example, Gov. James R. Thompson of Illinois and Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas talked about the money problems now facing all the states. More from them and less from the reporters would have been welcome.</p>
        <p>The Brinkley program, which makes the best use of television's abilities to show as well as tell, benefits from having a full hour, the opening five minutes of which are given to a solid background report, usually by Jack Smith. The questioning by George Will, Sam Donaldson and Mr. Brinkley himself can be counted on to cover the main bases, although Mr. Donaldson sometimes seems to be more intent on scoring points than getting answers, and Mr. Will sometimes enjoys showing off a bit and playing one-upmanship with a guest. But these are small failings in the most consistently interesting of the Sunday-morning offerings.</p>
        <p>Since three or more personages have to be tended to, regulars like Robert Dole, the Republican leader in the Senate, and Secretary of State James A. Baker Jr. can usually manage to string out their evasions until Mr. Brinkley tells them how much he has enjoyed having them visit. If the time now given to post-interview burblings by the interrogators were allocated to the question period, there would be more chance that the pressure could be sustained until the more hardened cases cracked a little.</p>
        <p>On Sunday morning, even the advertising is upscale. For example, General Electric, a major supporter, doesn't plug refrigerators. Using lots of soft-focus and slow motion, it sells an image of a company that brings ''good things to life.'' On these commercials, any patient who is lucky enough to be diagnosed by a G.E. scanner turns out to be healthy.</p>
        <p>Archer Daniels Midland (or A.D.M.), an entity few Americans are likely to have heard of except on Sunday morning, seems to be lobbying for maintaining restrictions on sugar imports without coming right out and saying so. Its messages rarely ask anything more directly of the viewer than appreciation for the company's desire to cut down on automobile pollution through the use of ethanol.</p>
        <p>Now and then, Merrill Lynch interrupts a discussion of the parlous condition of the economy to declare that ''it is bullish on America.'' When, one of the reporters might inquire, has a stockbroker ever gone public as bearish?</p>
        <p>These pitches are more on the order of public-service announcements than of ordinary commercials, not unlike the slogans that now accompany sponsors' names on public broadcasting. (Speaking of public broadcasting, Channel 13 offers its own upscale mall on Saturday mornings, when people's minds are more likely to be on real shopping or on servicing the kids and the car. There New Yorkers can find repeats of worthy programs like ''Metro Week in Review'' and new editions of such deserving durables as Richard D. Heffner's ''Open Mind.'' But how many viewers, I wonder, set their alarms to get up by 6:30 A.M. to catch a rerun of ''The 11th Hour''?) Inevitably, the Sunday morning packing of so many similar programs into so brief a space causes jams. A particularly unfortunate consequence for New Yorkers is that in their viewing area, ''Face'' and ''Meet,'' the premier interview programs of CBS and NBC, meet and face one another at 10:30. A quick suggestion: A switch of either to 11 A.M. would not only solve the problem but would also eliminate any reason for a viewer even to think about tuning into NBC's ''McLaughlin Group,'' most of whose journalistic combatants have evidently been chosen for speed and decibel count.</p>
        <p>Presumably Pat Buchanan, Morton Kondracke, Fred Barnes and the other gladiators are well informed, but for this half hour they are whipped up by their host, John McLaughlin, to a froth of opinionation. You come to welcome the moments when two or three are yelling so furiously that you can't make out what any of them is saying.</p>
        <p>Yet, even these harangues are sometimes on the mark. The question that opened the Feb. 25 program - would the Sandinistas accept defeat in that day's elections? - turned out to be the right one as well as the right-wing one. And unlike the assurances of a Sandinista victory that viewers got elsewhere, notably from ''World News Tonight,'' Mr. Kondracke's minority prediction of an opposition majority proved accurate.</p>
        <p>Although ''Face the Nation,'' ''Meet the Press'' and ''This Week'' are less self-indulgent as well as less weighted rightward than the McLaughlin noisefest, all would gain from more venturesome guest-selection, a reaching-out beyond the corridors of power to introduce audiences to people who are thinking about large issues in less political, less mainstream ways. But even if these Sunday-morning staples fail to respond to this suggestion or any of the others offered here, they can continue to count on this viewer's attention week after week.</p>
