        <p>Improvements in automobile gasoline mileage that would help the global environment would be more than wiped out by the rising number of automobiles on the road, said a study made public yesterday.</p>
        <p>The study by the World Resources Institute, a leading private organization concerned with the environment, said the number of motor vehicles is rising by 4.6 percent a year, about two and a half times as fast as the human population. By the year 2010, the number could reach 1.1 billion, more than double the current level, as the number of vehicles is rising by about two for each one thousand people every year, the study said.</p>

        <p>Improvements in automobile gasoline mileage that would help the global environment would be more than wiped out by the rising number of automobiles on the road, said a study made public yesterday.</p>
        <p>The study by the World Resources Institute, a leading private organization concerned with the environment, said the number of motor vehicles is rising by 4.6 percent a year, about two and a half times as fast as the human population. By the year 2010, the number could reach 1.1 billion, more than double the current level, as the number of vehicles is rising by about two for each one thousand people every year, the study said.</p>
        <p>In addition, the study said, "There is troubling evidence that worldwide, new cars are becoming less efficient" in their use of fuel.  A Plateau in Fuel Efficiency</p>
        <p>A pollution analyst at the Ford Motor Company, Michael J. Scharz, said the estimate on the number of cars was "not out of the realm of possibility." But he said most of the rise would have to be in the undeveloped world, where economic progress might not sustain such progress.</p>
        <p>An effort to lift fuel economy standards died in Congress at the end of the last session, but backers plan to try again. Cars sold in this country this year are about 4 percent less fuel efficient, on average, than those sold in 1988. The average fuel efficiency of cars on the road is still rising slowly, because the 1990-model cars are more efficient than old cars being scrapped, but a plateau in auto fuel economy is in sight in this country, the report said.</p>
        <p>The solution, it said, includes cars with very high gas mileage, as well as electric cars that do not burn fossil fuels, mass transit and reduction of other gas emissions that contribute to the greenhouse effect, including chlorofluorocarbons, from car air conditioners.</p>
        <p>Vehicles produce a growing fraction of the carbon dioxide that scientists fear will produce substantial climate changes in the next century. According to the study, "Driving Forces: Motor Vehicle Trends and their Implications for Global Warming, Energy Strategies, and Transportation Planning," vehicles accounted for 12 percent of carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel combustion in 1971; in 1985, it was 14 percent.</p>
        <p>Last month 18 European nations agreed to keep their carbon dioxide emissions at 1990 levels to reduce climate change, and they invited all other industrialized nations to do the same. But most of the growth is likely to come outside Europe and North America; Africa and Asia, excluding Japan, which make up nearly three quarters of the world's population, have only 12 percent of its motor vehicles, according to the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association of the United States,</p>
        <p>But Mr. Schwarz, of Ford, said that the report "doesn't address the social and economic implications of concluding that you have to stop, or drastically reduce, carbon dioxide from transportation sources."</p>
        <p>Stabilizing carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere would require far more than just holding fossil fuel use constant, the experts say. It would require cutting emissions by 50 percent or more.</p>
