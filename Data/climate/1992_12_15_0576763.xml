        <p>SCIENTISTS may be zeroing in on a tighter estimate of just how much the earth's climate stands to be warmed by industrial waste gases that trap the sun's heat.</p>
        <p>Such estimates are usually made by computers programmed to simulate the world's climate. These computer models, however impressive, are no better than the assumptions fed into them. Now comes a substantial independent check on the models: an analysis of how the earth's climate responded to changes in atmospheric heat-trapping carbon dioxide and other influences in the distant past, based on geological and geophysical evidence.</p>
        <p>The new analysis suggests that if the atmospheric carbon dioxide doubles from its present level, the average global climate will become about 4 degrees Fahrenheit warmer. Some previous estimates predicted temperatures much higher or much lower than this. Recent refinements of computer models show similar results; taken together, the new assessments point toward a warming range of 4 to 6 degrees.</p>
        <p>If no action to restrain carbon dioxide emissions is taken, say the authors of the study, the earth's temperature will soar over the next century to perhaps the highest levels in a million years. This would probably alter the earth's climate with disruptive and possibly catastrophic consequences for both human society and natural ecosystems.</p>
        <p>Climate assessments like these are no mere academic exercise but an essential guide to the nations of the world in deciding whether to take stronger action underthe global warming treaty signed last June in Rio de Janeiro. The Clinton Administration is expected to favor stronger controls on burning oil and coal, which produce carbon dioxide, than its predecessor.</p>
        <p>Assuming moderate world population and economic growth, the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is expected to double by the end of the next century if no further action to reduce emissions is taken.</p>
        <p>The latest scientific study, reported in the current issue of the British journal Nature, appears to bolster the case for emission reductions. It uses climatic data from two periods in the past, one 20,000 years ago, in the depths of the last ice age, and the other in the mid-Cretaceous period 100 million years ago, when the temperature was 18 degrees warmer than now. From study of these two exceptional periods, the authors have produced one of the first independent tests of computer predictions that until now have been virtually the only basis for assessing future warming.</p>
        <p>Those predictions, which say that doubled carbon dioxide concentrations would cause a warming of 3 to 8 degrees, have been the scientific basis of international policy until now.  The wide range results from uncertainties about the climate system built into the models. Other analyses have suggested that the warming could be as little as 1 degree or as much as 9 degrees.</p>
        <p>The average global surface temperature is now a little less than 60 degrees. According to various estimates, this is 5 to 9 degrees warmer than in the last ice age. Factors in Global Temperatures</p>
        <p>In the latest study, Dr. Martin I. Hoffert of New York University and Dr. Curt Covey of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California analyzed data, largely developed from geological studies, on how the climate of the two ancient epochs changed in response to various influences. These forces, each of which leaves some measurable change in the geological record, include solar radiation and heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide, which are produced naturally as well as by human industry. The analysis let the researchers calculate a pivotal property, the sensitivity or extent of response by the climate to each of these "forcing" factors.</p>
        <p>They found, for instance, that the earth's climate during the mid-Cretaceous was sensitive to carbon dioxide such that a doubling of the atmospheric content of the gas would raise the average global temperature by 4.5 degrees. The sensitivity of the ice-age climate 20,000 years ago was similar: a doubling of carbon dioxide would have produced a rise of 3.6 degrees. Combining the two results, Dr. Hoffert and Dr. Covey calculate that the climate's basic sensitivity to carbon dioxide is such that a doubling of the gas leads to a global warming of about 4 degrees, give or take 1.6 degrees.</p>
        <p>The finding "adds to the weight of evidence" favoring the findings of a panel set up by the United Nations to advise signatories to the climate treaty, Dr. Eric J. Barron, an earth scientist at Pennsylvania State University, wrote in a commentary in Nature.  The United Nations group, called the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, said earlier this year that its "best estimate" of the warming produced by a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide was 4.5 degrees.</p>
        <p>Effect of a Mask</p>
        <p>Some critics of the conventional wisdom on global warming have pointed out that the earth has not warmed up over the last century by nearly as much as the computer models say it should as a result of increasing carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>Other climatologists argue that industrial processes also exert a cooling effect by depleting the stratospheric ozone layer and emitting airborne aerosols that relect sunlight,and that this partly masks the larger warming effect. If emissions were curbed, the climatolotists say, the cooling effect of aerosols would dissipate quickly; but carbon dioxide would remain in the atmosphere for decades.</p>
        <p>Two climatologists at the University of East Anglia, Dr. Tom Wigley and Dr. Sarah Raper, have now calculated the extent of the postulated cooling effect. They find that without it, climate over the last century would have warmed by 6 degrees, much as the computer models have predicted.</p>
        <p>In their new analysis, Dr. Hoffert and Dr. Covey examined a number of reconstructions of the ice-age and mid-Cretaceous climates and calculated the strength of all the factors that both warm the climate and cool it. By combining these factors, or "forcings," they arrived at a net warming effect expressed in watts per square meter. Then they examined the corresponding global temperatures of the two periods as revealed, for example, in changing isotopes of oxygen and carbon in ocean sediments.</p>
        <p>From this information they calculated the change in both temperature and forcings between then and today; and from that, the climate's sensitivity as expressed by the temperature change resulting from doubled carbon dioxide. Common Findings</p>
        <p>In a similar exercise some time ago, Dr. James E. Hansen and colleagues at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York also examined climate data from the last ice age and found thata doubling of carbon dioxide would produce a warming of about 5.4 degrees.</p>
        <p>The Hoffert-Covey study takes the analysis a big step further: by analyzing both a colder and a warmer climate than today's, it suggests a general level of climate sensitivity that applies universally, in all eras including today's. Dr. Hansen, who has been outspoken in asserting that human-induced global warming is under way, characterizes the kind of paleoclimatic analysis performed by Dr. Hoffert and Dr. Covey as "extremely valid; the best method we have for estimating climate sensitivity." Questions About Study</p>
        <p>The weakness of the Hoffert-Covey calculation, a number of climatologists say, is that it introduces uncertainties of its own. Some of the data are "very, very shaky," said Dr. Syukuro Manabe, a climate expert at the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory at Princeton University. But Dr. Barron pointed out that the uncertainties have been factored into the Hoffert-Covey analysis and are reflected in the margin of error.</p>
        <p>And Dr. Manabe, despite his reservations, said of the Hoffert-Covey study: "I feel very comfortable with their conclusions; I think it is encouraging" in helping to produce a more precise assessment.</p>
        <p>The beauty of the Hoffert-Covey analysis of ancient climates, as its proponents see it, is that it gets around the key unknown that makes the computer models' predictions so uncertain: climate modelers do not yet know enough about the net effect on the earth's heat balance of clouds, which both trap and reflect warming radiation depending on circumstances, altitude and the type of cloud. Complex Network</p>
        <p>Although carbon dioxide is known to trap heat, the heat sets off an extremely complex network of interactions within the climate system, some of which amplify the heating and some of which lessen it. Climatologists have been trying to include all these interactions in the computer models, but the role played by clouds, especially, has eluded them.</p>
        <p>The Hoffert-Covey analysis implicitly includes the effect not only of clouds but of all the interactions, since the actual temperatures measured in those ancient periods would be the net result of the clouds and other feedbacks.</p>
        <p>Dr. Hoffert and Dr. Covey assert, and Dr. Barron agrees, that the analysis puts to rest claims that a doubling of carbon dioxide would produce a relatively negligible warming of 1 or 2 degrees. That, said Dr. Barron, is "fairly clear; that point in the study is pretty robust." The basic reason, says Dr. Hoffert, is that a climate whose responses are that sluggish would never have been able to produce the temperature extremes of both the ice age and the mid-Cretaceous.</p>
        <p>There is no guarantee that the carbon dioxide buildup in the atmosphere would halt once it had doubled, and some analyses indicate that this benchmark will be exceeded late in the next century if the present rate of carbon dioxide emissions continues.  Using estimates of future "business as usual" carbon-dioxide emissions made by the United Nations panel, Dr. Hoffert and Dr. Covey calculate that if their findings on climate sensitivity are right, the global climate would warm by 5.4 to 7.2 degrees by the year 2100.</p>
        <p>"Such a warming," they wrote, "is unprecedented in the past million years."</p>
        <p>All agree that there is a long way to go before truly precise and confident predictions about global warming can be made. Quite apart from the question of narrowing down the climate's general sensitivity to carbon dioxide emissions, there is the even more difficult and complex matter of how the change will be distributed from one region to another and what it will do, in practical terms, to the climate system.</p>
        <p>The latest findings, says Dr. Hansen, "imply that you would have a significant shift of climate zones with a doubling of carbon dioxide, but the details of that impact is something we're trying to understand."</p>
