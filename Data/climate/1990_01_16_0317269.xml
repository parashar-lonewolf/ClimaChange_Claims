        <p>LEAD: A HUGE Federal study has found that acid rain has turned many lakes and streams acidic not only in the Northeast but also in other areas of the East and parts of the Midwest, including northern Florida, the Appalachians and the New Jersey Pine Barrens.</p>
        <p>A HUGE Federal study has found that acid rain has turned many lakes and streams acidic not only in the Northeast but also in other areas of the East and parts of the Midwest, including northern Florida, the Appalachians and the New Jersey Pine Barrens.</p>
        <p>But the findings are not all bad. The researchers said the overall acidification of the nation's waters was less extensive than was feared when the research began a decade ago.</p>
        <p>''In the late 1970's, there was probably more alarm than is justified by what we currently see,'' said Lawrence A. Baker, an environmental engineer at the University of Minnesota Water Resources Center, the chief author of a new report in the section of the Federal study that deals with acidified lakes and streams.</p>
        <p>But in six areas of the country, the researchers have determined, acidification of lakes and streams is sufficient to merit special attention.</p>
        <p>''If I were living in one of them and was interested in water and recreation, I'd be concerned,'' Dr. Baker said in a telephone interview from the Environmental Protection Agency laboratory in Corvallis, Ore., where he has led the preparation of the report. 28 Reports Under Review The six areas where the researchers found cause for concern are the southwestern Adirondacks, New England, the Atlantic coastal plain, contiguous parts of northern Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, the Appalachians nearly as far south as North Carolina and the northern Florida highlands.</p>
        <p>The study is one of 28 ''state of the science'' reports that are being circulated by the National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program, a multi-agency project created by Congress in 1980 to provide a definitive understanding of the acid-rain problem. The reports are still being reviewed by other scientists and could be revised, but they are designed to provide the grist for a final report that the program plans to deliver this year.</p>
        <p>Acid rain is an overall term for rain, sleet, snow, mist, fog and clouds containing sulfuric acid and nitric acid produced by the burning of coal, oil and gasoline. The precipitation has made many lakes and streams so acidic that much aquatic life cannot survive in them.</p>
        <p>The findings on acid lakes and streams are based on an extensive survey of surface waters in parts of the country where acidification was suspected to be a problem, mostly in the East and Midwest but also in the Western mountains, from 1984 through 1986. Of an estimated 28,346 lakes in those areas, 2,311 were tested. A sample of 500 streams, representing an estimated 124,280 miles of stream reaches, was also tested.</p>
        <p>Lakes and streams vary in their vulnerability to acidity, depending on how alkaline they and the soils in surrounding watersheds are.</p>
        <p>The survey found that 4.2 percent of the lakes in the study were acidic. The researchers calculated that this represented 1,181 lakes over all, most of them in the Northeast, Florida and the upper Midwest.</p>
        <p>They found that inorganic sulfates of the kind produced by the burning of fossil fuels, borne by precipitation, were the dominant source of acid in those waters.</p>
        <p>But the numbers were much higher in what the report calls the six ''high-interest regions,'' which together accounted for almost all the acidic lakes and streams where acid rain was the main factor.</p>
        <p>Extent of Damage in 6 Areas</p>
        <p>In roughly the southwestern third of the Adirondacks, the researchers found that 38 percent of the lakes were acidified (no acidified lakes were found in the rest of the Adirondacks); in the seaboard lowlands of New England, 8 percent; in the Appalachians, 10 percent; in the Atlantic coastal plain, 11 percent; in parts of northern Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper Peninsula, 16 percent; and in the northern Florida highlands, a surprising 56 percent.</p>
        <p>The study determined that 2.7 percent of the streams in the national survey were acidified. But in the Appalachians, the proportion was 12 percent; in northern Florida, 28 percent; in the New Jersey Pine Barrens, 56 percent.</p>
        <p>The researchers also found that in the southwestern Adirondacks, 51 percent of the lakes registered a pH of 5.5 or less, a level of acidity at which damage to some aquatic life is believed to begin. The lower the pH, the more acid is the water. A pH of 7, the acidity level of pure water, is neutral. Lemon juice has a pH of 2.</p>
        <p>More than half the lakes and streams in northern Florida were found to have a pH of 5.5 or lower, as were 17 percent of forested streams and 9 percent of forested lakes in the Appalachians, and 92 percent of streams in the Pine Barrens of southeastern New Jersey.</p>
        <p>In the case of the lakes, Dr. Baker said, the numbers could actually be higher. This is because the survey in the eastern half of the country included only lakes larger than 10 acres.</p>
        <p>Many are smaller, and the report notes that a study by the Adirondack Lake Survey Corporation, which Dr. Baker called ''a good, valid study,'' determined that 35 percent of Adirondack lakes smaller than 10 acres were acidified. But while this could double the estimated number of acidic lakes in that region, he said, smaller lakes tend to be more influenced by natural acids.</p>
        <p>Dr. Baker said the stream survey did not include any streams in large parts of the Northeast, ''and we can reasonably expect that approximately 5,000 kilometers,'' or 3,100 miles, of streams in that area would be acidic.</p>
        <p>Pollution From Midwest</p>
        <p>Acidification of lakes in the Northeast and upper Midwest has been attributed to emissions from Middle Western power plants. Legislation now before Congress, sponsored by the Bush Administration, seeks to cut those emissions substantially.</p>
        <p>Dr. Baker said the surprisingly high proportion of acidic lakes in Florida appeared to be largely a result of coal-burning power plants in the state.</p>
        <p>In the Northeast, little further chemical change in lakes is expected because they are already at a steady state, James R. Mahoney, the director of the acid rain research program, has testified before Congress. He said that if acid precipitation on the lakes were cut by 30 percent, about half the lakes that are now acidic would improve in time.</p>
        <p>A few acidic lakes in the United States, and many in Sweden, have been brought back to life by simply adding limestone to them. Another state-of-the-science report now undergoing review says essentially that ''liming,'' as it is called, works and is the most effective method for neutralizing the acid.</p>
        <p>It estimates that more than 2,500 lakes and 22,000 miles of streams, with varying degrees of acidification, may be candidates for liming, and that many more would be candidates in Canada and Sweden.</p>
