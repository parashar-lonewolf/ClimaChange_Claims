        <p>Scientists Issue Warning On Global Warming  A growing number of scientists warn that at the rate political leaders are going it may be impossible to avoid a dangerous doubling of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere. Mainstream climatologists say that a doubling of pre-industrial levels would raise temperatures from 3 degrees to a potentially catastrophic 8 degrees, disrupting the earth's climate and causing the seas to rise.</p>

        <p>U.S. to Seek Move Against Iraq  American officials said they would ask the Security Council to take action to force Iraq to allow Americans to take part in United Nations weapons inspections there. Iraq blocked Americans from entering the country for the second time in less than a week.</p>

        <p>Jiang Winds Up Trip to U.S.  Concluding a weeklong visit, President Jiang Zemin of China cheerfully promoted trans-Pacific commerce in California, despite noisy protests and a pointed warning from his host, Gov. Pete Wilson, that ''the great elixir of individual freedom'' is the best recipe for economic growth.</p>

        <p>Wide Gap Before Mideast Talks  Israeli and Palestinian negotiators have spelled out sharply contradictory goals before a new round of American-mediated peace talks set to begin today in Washington. The Clinton Administration hopes that the talks may put the sides back on track. But the gulf is so wide that Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, has already dismissed the talks as ''just a waste of time.''</p>

        <p>New Soul-Searching in Belgium  A steady stream of body parts emerging from the cellar of an elderly pastor has set off a new round of questioning in Belgium, a country that has grown uncomfortably familiar with the macabre.</p>

        <p>Brazilians Fear Devaluation  Brazilians have begun watching their pocketbooks, delaying purchases and refusing to take on new debt as turmoil in world financial markets added pressure on the Government to devalue its currency. Last week, Brazil's central bank nearly doubled its benchmark interest rate in an effort to restore investor confidence.</p>

        <p>Possible Budget Surplus Stirs Debate on Spending It  Congress and the White House face the possibility that the Government will begin running surpluses in the next few years, and already a heated debate is breaking out over what to do with the money.</p>

        <p>Amtrak Strike Is Averted  Amtrak and the union representing 2,300 track and tunnel workers have reached ''the basic terms of a new labor agreement,'' the Transportation Secretary said. The tentative agreement averted a threatened strike that would have shut down the Northeast Corridor from Boston to Washington and intercity trains all over the Eastern United States.</p>

        <p>Tradition and Tolerance  Some Muslim women who wear the traditional Islamic head scarf in public say that the only price they have paid is in occasional stares or rude questions, but others say that they have met with discrimination on the job and harassment from strangers in the streets. Among Muslim women across the United States, a great debate is taking place: Is it prudent, safe or necessary to wear the headdress in public?</p>

        <p>Oklahoma Bombing Trial  Opening statements will be made today in the trial of Terry Nichols, the second person charged in the bombing of the Federal building in Oklahoma City in 1995 that killed 168 people. A jury of seven women and five men has been seated in United States District Court in Denver. The Government accuses Mr. Nichols of helping Timothy McVeigh, who was convicted of murder and conspiracy in June and sentenced to death, plan the attack and build the bomb.</p>

        <p>Silence from Pathfinder  Scientists have all but given up on restoring radio communication with the Pathfinder space probe that landed on Mars on July 4. Pathfinder fell silent on Sept. 27, after nearly three months of sending back information. On Tuesday, scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., will stop daily efforts to re-establish contact and will instead try only once a week, or perhaps just once a month. The scientists speculate that communications were severed by a burned-out battery, by cold affecting the spacecraft's communications equipment or by a computer problem. (Agence France-Presse)</p>
        <p>A Transit Plan for Denver  Environmentalists and business leaders in Denver are urging voters to approve on Tuesday a $16 billion plan to graft a hub-and-spoke light rail system onto the city's booming metropolitan area to ease increasing traffic congestion and air pollution, known locally as the ''Brown Cloud.'' One of the most ambitious such plans in the nation, Denver's proposal reflects the West's sharpening love-hate relationship with mass transit. A poll showed narrow support for the plan.</p>

        <p>Clinton Calls on Democrats To Rally Around Messinger  President Clinton came to Manhattan to promote the mayoral candidacy of Ruth W. Messinger. Asserting that Ms. Messinger had grasped the key issues confronting the city now that crime was in decline -- failing schools and lingering unemployment -- Mr. Clinton issued what was, in effect, a call to Democrats to come home and support his party's candidate in tomorrow's election. He did not once mention or criticize Ms. Messinger's Republican opponent, Mayor Giuliani.</p>

        <p>Campaigning in New Jersey  Prominent national leaders from the Democratic and Republican Parties weighed in on the New Jersey governor's race, telling voters that their decisions on Tuesday would send a message to the country. President Clinton campaigned for James E. McGreevey, the Democrat, at Middlesex County College. Gov. Christine Todd Whitman campaigned by bus with Representative John Kasich, Republican of Ohio, chairman of the House budget committee.</p>

        <p>Work Halted at Trump Project  The city's Department of Buildings has issued a stop-work order for Donald Trump's Riverside South project on the Upper West Side after discovering that concrete slabs poured nearly two months ago on the tower's fifth floor are too weak to bear the full weight of the 46-story tower now under construction. The building, at 300 Riverside South, between 69th Street and 70th Street, now stands 20 stories.</p>

        <p>Connecticut Trims Welfare Roll  Connecticut cut off welfare benefits over the weekend for hundreds of families who had reached the state's 21-month time limit, beginning a process that could eliminate about a fifth of Connecticut's welfare caseload by November 1998.</p>

        <p>Kenyan Is First in Marathon  John Kagwe of Kenya won the New York City Marathon, finishing in 2 hours 8 minutes 12 seconds. Franziska Rochat-Moser was first among the women, with a time of 2:28:43, becoming the only person from Switzerland ever to win a major marathon.</p>

        <p>Controversy Over Aid  The women's part of the marathon may be remembered not for the upset victory of a 31-year-old Swiss lawyer/restaurateur or the disappointing seventh-place finish of the crowd favorite. Instead, it may be recalled as the marathon in which many of the leaders received help, planned or otherwise, from friends or strangers who provided them with drinks during the race. One competitor, Kim Jones of Spokane, Wash., who finished sixth, said that some runners had received an unfair advantage at the water stations.</p>

        <p>TV Bidding War Looms  The NBC television drama ''E.R.'' is about to be put up for auction, and the networks' bidding could be the most frenzied and unrestrained in the history of television, rivaling the competition for the rights to the Olympics and other major sports events.</p>

        <p>Rail Problems in the West  Service disruptions in the 36,000-mile network of the Union Pacific Railroad, the country's largest, have created huge backlogs in deliveries of coal, grain, plastics, chemicals, automobiles and other products in much of the nation. They have pushed up natural gas prices by 50 percent in some areas and created a drag on economic growth. The system, which has been hampered by congestion, shortages of equipment and crews and by multiple wrecks, could become further strained in the next few weeks as bumper crops of soybeans and corn are harvested. In response, the Federal Surface Transportation Board in Washington declared a transportation emergency on Friday in the West and ordered Union Pacific to open a section of track to a Texas competitor, the Texas Mexican Railway, to ease the gridlock.</p>
