        <p>DURING the Revolutionary War, the redcoats occupied Long Island longer than any other place in the Colonies. Now, 222 years later, the British are back -- this time in business suits, armed with billions to buy KeySpan, the private partner in the private-public system that supplies energy to Long Island.</p>
        <p>It will take a long time to complete the $7.3 billion acquisition of KeySpan by the British company, National Grid -- a deal that was formally announced on Monday. Approvals from regulators are at least a year away, and it remains a matter of conjecture whether significant local opposition will develop.</p>
        <p>The two companies promised a seamless transition, with no negative effects for Long Island energy customers and no Union Jacks on KeySpan trucks. National Grid, based in London, already owns a large upstate utility, holding out the promise of economies of scale and cost savings.</p>
        <p>But in the early going, Richard M. Kessel, the chairman of the Long Island Power Authority, the public half of Long Island's power supply system, is already pressing for concessions that would lower electric rates. ''This is a $7.3 billion deal, and some of that money ought to go to LIPA customers to lower those bills that people are so upset about,'' Mr. Kessel said in an interview on Monday. ''We're not opposed to the deal, and it may be a good deal, but we have got to look at what's in it for LIPA customers.''</p>
        <p>Late on Wednesday following an initial meeting, Mr. Kessel; Robert B. Catell, KeySpan's chairman and chief executive; Michael E. Jesanis, chief executive of National Grid USA; and Steve Holiday, the group chief executive-designate for National Grid, said they had agreed on a team that would address issues LIPA has raised and would examine potential benefits to LIPA customers from the acquisition.</p>
        <p>Some of the power authority's customers are more than just upset about rates. They filed a suit in State Supreme Court in Mineola on Feb. 22, seeking class-action status and complaining that the authority improperly disguised rate increases as fuel-adjustment surcharges. LIPA denied the accusation and has asked the New York State Public Service Commission to investigate the issue.</p>
        <p>But news of the KeySpan sale abruptly changed the subject.</p>
        <p>The deal would end KeySpan's existence as a stand-alone company, created by the 1998 merger of Brooklyn Union Gas, which supplied gas to parts of New York City, and some parts of the old Long Island Lighting Company, though the KeySpan name would be retained. It is part of a national trend toward utility acquisitions, made easier by a recent change in federal law. The combined entity would be the third-largest energy-delivery company in the country.</p>
        <p>But Long Island, which was everything to Lilco and a central focus for KeySpan, would become just one service area for an ambitious, growing international company, forced to compete with National Grid's other areas for capital and attention.</p>
        <p>National Grid, which owns and operates Britain's national gas and electricity distribution systems, would serve more than eight million customers in New York, Rhode Island, Massachusetts and New Hampshire. Nassau and Suffolk Counties and the Rockaway peninsula in Queens -- the former Lilco territory served by KeySpan -- would account for somewhat more than a million of them.</p>
        <p>Holders of KeySpan stock, who are numerous on the Island, stand to get $42 in cash for each of their shares, which had been trading in the $36 range recently, before the sale was announced. That will be a bonanza for company officials who have large holdings, including Mr. Catell, who owns more than two million shares.</p>
        <p>Instead of retiring, Mr. Catell, 69, is expected to stay on as executive chairman of the American subsidiary, National Grid USA, and deputy chairman of the parent company, National Grid. He is likely to be deeply involved in the details of joining the two companies and in trying to persuade Mr. Kessel to support the deal.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kessel and the power authority are crucial to the deal's success, because LIPA is effectively KeySpan's biggest customer by far. The power authority buys the electricity produced by KeySpan's Long Island power plants wholesale and pays KeySpan to manage and maintain the islandwide network of wires and poles and transformers that deliver the power to homes and businesses.</p>
        <p>The contracts, which were renegotiated and extended in December to run at least until 2013, give LIPA the right to terminate them if KeySpan is sold.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kessel said the power authority had been aware for some time that KeySpan could be an acquisition target, but had not expected a deal quite so soon after the contracts were extended.</p>
        <p>In the December agreement, KeySpan accepted a $34 million cut in its management fees and agreed to pay the authority a total of $120 million to settle various disagreements. The deal also gave LIPA a year to decide whether to buy KeySpan's power plants in Island Park and Far Rockaway for their book value, $75 million, and overhaul them to increase capacity and reduce emissions, a process known as repowering.</p>
        <p>Mr. Catell said at a news conference on Monday in Brooklyn that he did not expect the acquisition to lead to another renegotiation of the LIPA-KeySpan agreement. Jackie Barry, a spokeswoman for National Grid in Westborough, Mass., said it also expected the agreement to stand.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Kessel expressed a different view. He said the authority would review the December agreement again and also take a detailed look at the buyer.</p>
        <p>''When we entered into this agreement with KeySpan, National Grid was not part of the picture,'' he said. ''They are now, so we have to take a look at every single option. Everything is out there on the table, and we need to review it all.''</p>
        <p>''I'm not sure if we could stop it,'' Mr. Kessel said of the acquisition, ''but that doesn't mean we have to be a part of it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kessel said he has written to Eliot Spitzer, the state attorney general, and to Alan G. Hevesi, the state comptroller, saying the authority would need time to assess the changed circumstances. Mr. Spitzer and Mr. Hevesi are reviewing the December LIPA-KeySpan pact.</p>
        <p>Matthew C. Cordaro, the director of the Center for Management Analysis at the Long Island University C. W. Post campus and a former vice president of Lilco, said opposition from LIPA could be a major obstacle for National Grid. ''It would depend on how serious National Grid is about the Long Island electric operation,'' he said. ''And that's hard to assess.''</p>
        <p>''There is still a long way to go before the ink is dry on this,'' Mr. Cordaro said. ''I don't see it happening without some understanding with LIPA that the new player is going to be acceptable.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Jesanis dismissed talk that the company would quickly sell KeySpan's generating plants, including the large power stations in Port Jefferson, Northport and Glenwood Landing and the Ravenswood plant in Queens.</p>
        <p>''They are good assets and at this point we are going to be happy to own them and have the talented people at KeySpan operate them,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Cordaro said that National Grid might rethink its plans for the plants if the power authority proved troublesome.</p>
        <p>National Grid and KeySpan said that job cuts among KeySpan's more than 4,000 Long Island employees as a result of the merger would be held to a minimum, and would be accomplished primarily through retirements and attrition.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Cordaro said that any deal of this kind could threaten jobs. ''The downside is that when someone makes an acquisition like this, they try to recover the costs,'' he said. ''And usually, to do that, they have to makesome improvements in efficiency, and what that translates to in many cases is a reduction in the work force.''</p>
        <p>KeysSpan's unions were keeping their powder dry. ''We've been down this path before, and we're not novices,'' said Ralph Ranghelli, the business manager of Local 1049 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which represents about 2,000 KeySpan employees, many of whom once worked for Lilco.</p>
        <p>''In the short term, we think that this deal won't change our day-to-day operations,'' Mr. Ranghelli said. ''Long term, we need to get to know the folks at Grid and hopefully understand their plans.''</p>
        <p>Business leaders were circumspect. ''I think it remains to be seen what effect it would have on Long Island,'' said Matthew T. Crosson, the president of the Long Island Association. ''National Grid is a well-respected company.''</p>
        <p>The deal must be approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the New York State Public Service Commission.</p>
        <p>In Albany, Paul Tonka, a Democratic state assemblyman and the chairman of the Assembly's energy committee, has questioned whether a larger utility would mean better service, and said his committee would hold hearings on the deal. Mr. Tonka's district is in Schenectady, which is served by Niagara-Mohawk, a gas and electric utility covering much of upstate New York. National Grid bought the utility in 2003.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tonka's counterpart in the State Senate, James W. Wright, a Republican from Watertown, said National Grid's takeover of Niagara-Mohawk had had ''the kind of positive impact I think we will see as this merger moves along.'' His district, too, is served by the company.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wright said that he expected National Grid to realize economies of scale that would help keep energy bills down. ''As the company itself grows stronger, that is certainly beneficial to all components of the company,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Advocates of repowering and alternative energy said they would judge the deal on environmental grounds. ''Generally, National Grid is seen as a well-managed company,'' said Gordian Raacke, the executive director of Renewable Energy Long Island, in Bridgehampton. ''An important question that any prospective new owner must answer for Long Island is whether they intend to clean up and repower Long Island's aging power plants.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Barry, the National Grid spokeswoman, said the company had taken no position yet on repowering. ''The ink is barely dry on our acquisition announcement,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Mark Serotoff of Commack, coordinator of the Sustainable Energy Alliance of Long Island, said he saw cause for hope: ''I'm optimistic that these dinosaur, antique clunker power plants will get rebuilt and updated with fresh blood and fresh air from across the Atlantic.''</p>
