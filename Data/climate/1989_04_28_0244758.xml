        <p>LEAD: The Secretary of Energy, James D. Watkins, pledged today to do ''everything in my power'' to prevent the dismantling of the Shoreham nuclear power plant.</p>
        <p>The Secretary of Energy, James D. Watkins, pledged today to do ''everything in my power'' to prevent the dismantling of the Shoreham nuclear power plant.</p>
        <p>''If activists can prevent things from being built,'' he said, ''I can prevent things from being shut down when it's stupid.'' He added that ''there is no way I will give up on that battle'' at a time when energy needs are growing and the nuclear power industry is stagnant.</p>
        <p>Mr. Watkins said he was not yet prepared to detail how he would fight for the $5.5 billion plant, which the Long Island Lighting Company, its financially strapped owner, plans to sell to New York State for $1 in exchange for a decade of rate increases.</p>
        <p>Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, under pressure from Long Islanders fearful about how safe Shoreham is, has promised to close the plant permanently after the state takeover. May Have Plant Preserved</p>
        <p>Brad Johnson, Mr. Cuomo's representative here, said that ''the issue is moot.''</p>
        <p>''Ironic that with so many mismanaged, hazardous D.O.E. defense facilities he feels he has standing to give us instructions on nuclear plants,'' Mr. Johnson said of Mr. Watkins.</p>
        <p>Mr. Watkins said that one strategy to head off the closing of Shoreham would involve challenges to the Lilco-New York accord and to the planned transfer to the state of the plant's license to operate at full power, granted by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission last week.</p>
        <p>''There's a lot of steps in the agreement that I don't think meet the criteria for a responsible shift in licensing for an operating plant and shutdown and transfer of radioactive material,'' Mr. Watkins said.  The 'Tragedy' of Dismantlement Another avenue, he suggested, would be to appeal to Lilco stockholders before their final vote on the agreement in June. Mr. Watkins said he thought it was still possible that ''the shareholders would find that somehow it's not going to be in their best interest to go through the tragedy of a dismantlement process where I'm going to be in there fighting every inch of the way.''</p>
        <p>Should he fail to get Shoreham into operation, the Secretary said that ''as a minimum fallback position'' he would try to have the plant preserved for future use.</p>
        <p>Mr. Watkins, a retired Navy admiral who was sworn in as head of the Energy Department last month, made his comments at his office today.</p>
        <p>During his tenure, he said, he planned to make nuclear power ''a key element of our future national energy strategy.'' To accomplish that, he added, will require a sweeping reorganization of the department and of its relationships with its contractors, establishing ''new standards of accountability so that the American people know we know how to manage things.''</p>
        <p>Citing growing public awareness of the problems of global warming, acid rain and air pollution resulting from burning fossil fuels, he said, ''I believe we're at the threshold of a turnaround in national attitudes toward nuclear power.''</p>
        <p>Opposition to nuclear energy, he asserted, has come about largely because of ''years of educational neglect in our country on things scientific, engineering, mathematics.''</p>
