        <p>Paul Ludick, a 31-year-old furniture terrorist, designs chairs that cause occupants to sit up and shudder. His Chair-Noble, a play on Chernobyl, is a wooden stool shaped like a nuclear power plant. The back of his Apartheid Chair is fashioned from black-and-white chain link fencing. Pistols point from the Arms Chair, an easy chair calculated to make the sitter uneasy.</p>
        <p>Yet some find security in guns, Mr. Ludick notes, even cap pistols like the ones in his chair. He echoes this feeling with a homey upholstery fabric reminiscent of his childhood in Kent, Ohio: ''The colors, warm browns and yellows, are McDonald's colors.''</p>
        <p>A one-of-a-kind design, the Arms Chair was featured in HG magazine as a ''Chair of the Month'' and sold to a collector for $4,200. Not all his pieces are as expensive or as exclusive. A manufactured line of storage as well as seating is available through Furniture of the Twentieth Century, 227 West 17th Street. Prices range from $250 to $3,500, and chairs make no political statements. They are curvy, even friendly.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ludick became intrigued with ''the chair as an extension of the self'' at Kent State University, where he majored in sculpture and performance art. He describes his early chairs as ''manipulations of posture'' that challenged sitters to get in or out of them. His new chairs put the body, if not the mind, at ease.</p>
        <p>As he prepares for an exhibition of 30 chairs at the Bernice Steinbaum Gallery, 132 Greene Street (near Prince Street), starting June 20, Mr. Ludick turns to the fragility of the earth's ozone layer. The chairs are the earth - their maple frames painted gold, their seats formed from stones gathered around the world by traveling friends and cushioned by foam rubber.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ludick says he hopes buyers will not disturb the chairs' clear plastic covering. That's the ozone layer.</p>
