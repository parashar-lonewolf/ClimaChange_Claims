        <p>The Ford Motor Company reaffirmed its concerns about global warming today, but said that it did not support stiffer federal fuel-economy standards or the international Kyoto Protocol on greenhouse gas emissions as ways to address the problem.</p>
        <p>In its second ''corporate citizenship report,'' Ford said that it had formed a committee of executives to examine ways to reduce the company's contribution to global warming.</p>
        <p>The report estimated that Ford factories and vehicles around the world emitted about 400 million metric tons of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases a year, or about 2 percent of all emissions caused by people.</p>
        <p>''On the issue of climate change, there's no doubt that sufficient evidence exists to move from argument to action,'' Jacques Nasser, Ford's chief executive, said in a preamble to the report.</p>
        <p>Environmental advocates, with whom Ford's leaders have held extensive discussions, said today that they were willing to overlook the automaker's continued reservations about tougher fuel standards and the Kyoto agreement.</p>
        <p>Instead, they praised Ford for being willing to address the issue of global warming, particularly in light of President Bush's recent disavowal of the Kyoto agreement.</p>
        <p>''Ford's efforts to be a responsible corporate citizen,'' the Sierra Club said in a statement, ''are in stark contrast with the Bush administration's irresponsible remarks trivializing energy efficiency and President Bush's broken promise on curbing global warming.''</p>
        <p>The burning of gasoline by automobiles is the second-largest source of carbon dioxide emissions in the United States, after power plants. Many scientists say that the emissions may be causing the earth's atmosphere to become warmer.</p>
        <p>For its part, Ford is trying to establish an environmentally friendly image in an effort to sell more cars. Today's report highlighted voluntary commitments that it made last summer. The company said that it would increase the average fuel economy of its sport utility vehicles by 25 percent by 2005. It also said that it would start selling a gasoline-electric hybrid version of the Ford Escape sport utility in 2003.</p>
        <p>General Motors and DaimlerChrysler have since said that they would match Ford by improving the gas mileage of their light trucks, a category that includes pickups and minivans as well as sport utility vehicles.</p>
        <p>Martin B. Zimmerman, Ford's vice president for governmental affairs, told reporters today that continued research into ways to improve fuel efficiency, like fuel cells, would be more valuable than new government mandates that automakers increase the fuel economy of light trucks.</p>
        <p>''The way to solve this issue,'' Mr. Zimmerman said, ''is not with small, incremental change.''</p>
        <p>G.M. and DaimlerChrysler echoed Ford's comments. Dennis Minano, G.M.'s chief environmental officer, said that, in particular,  the automaker opposed increases in the fuel-economy standards for light trucks, which are allowed to burn 33 percent more gasoline per mile than cars.</p>
        <p>William Clay Ford Jr., the chairman of Ford, was among the first corporate executives to raise the global warming issue, mentioning it in speeches since 1996.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ford and a few of his aides drafted last year's corporate citizenship report, which attracted national attention with its candid discussion of the safety and environmental drawbacks of sport utilities.</p>
