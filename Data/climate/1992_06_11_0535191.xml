        <p>Negotiatiors from rich and poor countries were moving tonight toward a multibillion-dollar agreement under which the industrialized nations would help the third world pay the extra costs of making sure that their economic development does not inflict irreparable damage on the world's fragile ecological systems.</p>
        <p>Environment and development ministers from many of the 178 countries attending the Earth Summit will try to conclude the agreement at their first ministerial-level meeting on Thursday by seeking a compromise on the exact amount of new aid and on new steps to preserve the world's dwindling forests and fight pollution of the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>Participants said today that after all-night negotiations, a deal appeared to be in sight on the crucial question of financing environmentally sustainable development in the third world. That accord may open the way to resolving other disputes, they said.</p>
        <p>With heads of state and government due to start arriving here on Thursday, negotiators are under intense pressure to complete the package of new environmental measures. Their leaders hope to sign the accords at the conclusion of the Earth Summit this weekend. Statement of Principles</p>
        <p>Those measures include a statement setting out the broad principles that should guide the world as its tries to avoid exhausting environmental resources yet sustain economic growth. The leaders also plan to adopt a more detailed action plan, known as Agenda 21, that outlines steps for achieving that goal in every environmental sector and provides for the North to help pay the extra costs that such safeguards will entail in the developing world.</p>
        <p>The United States is also pushing hard for a declaration on principles countries should follow to save the world's diminishing forests. The measure would be nonbinding, but would commit the nations to negotiating a binding convention on the issue later on.</p>
        <p>New conventions on curbing emissions of climate-changing gases and on preserving rare plants and animals have already been prepared for signature by the leaders attending the gathering, which is described as the biggest conference of governments ever held. Organizer Is 'Encouraged'</p>
        <p>At a news conference late this afternoon, the summit meeting's organizer, Maurice Strong of Canada, said he was "very encouraged at the progress being made" in the aid talks. "Outstanding issues are not going to override the tremendous desire to suceed," he said.</p>
        <p>Other diplomats appeared more optimistic than they had been a day or so ago, when the gap between North and South seemed formidably large. The American Assistant Secretary of State for Economic and Agriculture Affairs, Michael Young, said that "things are falling into place."</p>
        <p>Industrialized countries have been resisting third world demands that they enter into a binding new commitment to raise the volume of their assistance to 0.7 percent of their economic output by the year 2000. Their contributions currently average about 0.45 percent.</p>
        <p>The United States is outside the debate because it has never accepted the 0.7 percent target. Other industrialized nations endorsed that goal some 20 years ago but have never achieved it as a group.</p>
        <p>Diplomats say the ministers will try to reach agreement on a vaguer commitment by Western Europe, Canada, Japan, Australia and New Zealand to reach the target of 0.7 percent "as soon as possible" or "by the year 2000 or as soon as possible thereafter." Concrete Aid Commitments</p>
        <p>To win the support of the developing world for this compromise, the industrialized countries are making a series of specific and immediate new aid commitments, diplomats said.</p>
        <p>The 12 European Community countries are discussing a plan to offer $3 billion to $5 billion in environmental aid over the next five years. This would involve rolling over some existing aid projects into a single community-wide package but would also include new money, officials said.</p>
        <p>Japan plans to increase its environmental aid to developing countries from $2.3 billion for the three-year period from 1989 through 1991 to $7 billion over the next five years. That would mean an increase from about $800 million a year to $1.4 billion a year.</p>
        <p>The United States and other donors are considering creating a new fund for the World Bank's International Development Agency next year that would provide virtually free environmental loans to the world's poorest nations.</p>
        <p>They are also expected to agree to double, or perhaps triple, the $1.3 billion Global Environment Facility they established at the World Bank three years ago to finance third world environmental projects. That financing comes up for renewal next year.</p>
        <p>Finally, heads of state and government from the industrialized world are expected to commit themselves to increasing the flow of aid when they address the Earth Summit at the end of the week, though it is unclear whether they will pledge specific amounts.</p>
        <p>Ministers attending the meeting on Thursday will also seek a compromise on a plan strongly supported by the United States to adopt a set of principles on forest preservation, including a commitment to negotiate a binding convention.</p>
        <p>In an effort to win African support for a strong statement on principles and a commitment to such a binding convention, the United States agreed today to support African countries in seeking another international convention to fight the creeping encroachment of the desert on their continent.</p>
        <p>Officials say the summit participants are likely to call on the United Nations General Assembly to set up a negotiating body to complete a convention on the desert by June 1994. Several Fighting Forest Pact</p>
        <p>Several countries with extensive forests, led by Malaysia but including India and Brazil, are opposed to the declaration of principles on forests and want to weaken it as much as possible.</p>
        <p>Finally, the ministers will try to deal with an effort by Saudi Arabia and other big oil producers to weaken proposed pledges on conserving energy.</p>
        <p>The Saudis argue that these pledges are unnecessary now that the nations have agreed to a convention on the climate that would require countries to curb their emissions of carbon dioxide and other warming gases generated by the burning of fossil fuels.</p>
