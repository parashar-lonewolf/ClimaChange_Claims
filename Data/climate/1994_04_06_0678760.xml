        <p>Talks to stave off the destruction of the world's fisheries made modest progress at a recent three-week session, but prospects appear dim for a comprehensive accord to conserve endangered species.</p>
        <p>"Recent collapses of fish stocks in different parts of the world underscore the urgency of our task," the conference chairman, Satya Nandan of Fiji, told weary delegates at the closing gathering on Thursday.  "However, the conference still has a long way to go before it can successfully complete its work." The 80-nation conference has set August as the deadline for an agreement.</p>
        <p>The most daunting challenge, Mr.  Nandan and other diplomats said, will be to persuade rival fishing countries to accept the notion that measures to conserve species like haddock, swordfish, cod, pollock and tuna must be applied not only on the high seas but also in coastal waters where nations have the right to regulate fishing within 200 miles of their shores.</p>
        <p>The issue, experts say, is a clash between the rights of nations and the icthyological reality that fish do not respect jurisdictional boundaries.  Unless there is a resolution of that, no real progress is likely on such matters as establishing scientific standards for when to fish, and how much, and enforcing fishing rules. Abuse Is Charged</p>
        <p>"What we've been trying to do here," Mr. Nandan told reporters, "is get away from the jurisdictional issues and try to focus on the real problem, which is saving the fish."</p>
        <p>Many of the 70 coastal countries at the talks assert that the long-range fleets of nations including Japan, Korea, Poland and China have been abusing their freedom to fish in international waters, using highly mechanized equipment to haul in excessive quantities of fish. The distant-water nations retort that the coastal countries have done the most damage by failing to manage stocks within their 200-mile fishing zones, where most of the world catch is made.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists say both sides are to blame.</p>
        <p>"The fundamental issue of fisheries conservation has been held hostage to squabbling over national sovereignty versus international responsibility," said Matthew Gianni of Greenpeace International, one of 30 nongovernmental groups accredited to the talks. "Meanwhile, the growing crisis in world fisheries will only get worse."</p>
        <p>So deep are the differences that there is no consensus yet on whether governments are negotiating a legally binding treaty comparable to recent agreements to protect the ozone layer and the earth's biological diversity -- or simply a nonbinding set of guidelines.</p>
        <p>Canada, Russia, Chile and other coastal nations, vowing to protect depleted stocks against foreign encroachment, have suggested in recent months that in the absence of binding rules for high-seas fishing, they may begin seizing vessels in international waters.</p>
        <p>The 10 distant-water nations made it clear during the talks that they would like to see comprehensive regulations applied in national and international waters, but insist that they be voluntary and somewhat flexible. Fears Over Sovereignty</p>
        <p>But many coastal countries, especially in Latin America, blanch at the prospect of being forced to abide by international rules within their 200-mile fishing zones, fearing that their sovereignty would be at stake.</p>
        <p>"These delegations are saying, in effect, that this conference should develop binding rules and concepts, but not for them -- only for those who fish on the high seas," the chief of the American delegation, Larry L. Snead, told delegates.</p>
        <p>The United States, which has extensive coastal fisheries as well as long-range fleets, has tried to mediate between the two sides, arguing that what is needed is a uniform set of nonbinding rules that would be enforced by regional fishing organizations.</p>
        <p>But many environmental groups are convinced that only a legally binding, global agreement will save the fisheries, arguing that there is no guarantee that voluntary measures will be vigorously enforced by regional fisheries organizations.</p>
