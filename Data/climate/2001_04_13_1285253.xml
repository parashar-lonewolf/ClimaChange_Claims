        <p>President Bush announced today that sweeping rules to protect the privacy of medical records would take effect on Saturday. But he said the rules, issued by President Bill Clinton, could later be revised or clarified to address ''legitimate concerns'' of the health care industry.</p>
        <p>The rules establish the first comprehensive federal standards for medical privacy. They will affect virtually every doctor, patient, hospital, pharmacy and health insurance plan in the United States.</p>
        <p>The Bush administration had considered delaying the rules to consider objections from the health care industry, which said the standards would impose costly administrative burdens. Instead, Mr. Bush decided that the rules would take effect on schedule, but he asked the secretary of health and human services, Tommy G. Thompson, to suggest ''appropriate modifications'' to ensure, for example, that parents can see their children's records.</p>
        <p>Under the rules, Mr. Bush said, ''patients will have full access to their medical records and more control over how their personal information will be used and disclosed.''</p>
        <p>The rules require doctors, hospitals and other health care providers to obtain written consent from patients before using or disclosing medical information for even routine purposes like treatment or the payment of claims. Patients would have a federal right to inspect and copy their records and could propose corrections. The rules cover not only paper records, but also computer files and even oral communications.</p>
        <p>Consumer groups see the rules as a landmark in the history of American medicine. Many insurers, they say, have disclosed personal health information to lenders, employers or marketers without the patients' permission. As a result, they say, people have lost jobs and suffered other forms of discrimination, and some patients are so worried that they shun care or provide inaccurate information to doctors.</p>
        <p>By allowing the rules to take effect, despite the administration's view that some provisions are unworkable, Mr. Bush avoided the criticism that surrounded the rollback of other Clinton administration policies. Those policies dealt with arsenic in drinking water, global warming and preventing repetitive-stress injuries in the workplace, among other issues.</p>
        <p>In reversing such policies, Mr. Bush has run the political risk of cementing an image of his administration as one that favors business at the expense of consumers.</p>
        <p>Last week, the administration hastily reversed course on a plan to end the testing of school lunch meat for the bacteria salmonella. Rather than suffer another such incident, Mr. Bush took a more nuanced approach today, embracing the popular cause of medical privacy while opening the door to changes sought by the regulated industry.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's decision guarantees a new struggle over the details of the rules and their interpretation.</p>
        <p>Today's decision was a victory for consumer groups and privacy advocates, without being an utter defeat for the health care industry and insurance companies, which strenuously opposed the rules.</p>
        <p>Democrats, consumer groups and privacy advocates praised the Bush administration. Hospital executives and other health care providers said they were profoundly disappointed.</p>
        <p>Peter P. Swire, chief counselor for privacy in the Clinton White House, said: ''Today's decision by President Bush sends a clear signal to industry that it's time to stop the delay and get to work protecting privacy. But there's a risk that possible future modification of the rules could turn into very large exceptions.''</p>
        <p>Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, said the rules represented ''a huge step forward for the medical privacy rights of all Americans.'' His tone echoed that of Mr. Thompson, who said, ''The president considers this a tremendous victory for American consumers.''</p>
        <p>But Scott P. Serota, president of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, said the rules would create ''an operational nightmare.''</p>
        <p>Health care providers and insurers have two years to come into compliance. After April 14, 2003, a person who violates the rules will be subject to civil and criminal penalties, including a $250,000 fine and 10 years in prison for the most egregious violations.</p>
        <p>One provision of the rules, the consent requirement, was particularly troublesome for pharmacists. They said it would be difficult to obtain written consent from a patient whose doctor phoned in a prescription that was picked up by a neighbor or a relative.</p>
        <p>Secretary Thompson said the government would make clear, through guidelines or changes in the rules, that pharmacists can ''fill prescriptions over the phone and serve their customers in a timely manner.''</p>
        <p>In addition, Mr. Thompson said, the government will make clear that parents have ''access to information about the health and well-being of their children, including information about mental health, substance abuse or abortion.''</p>
        <p>The American Civil Liberties Union welcomed today's ''surprise decision,'' but said it saw ''ominous signs'' that the administration might weaken the rules. Catherine Weiss, director of the union's reproductive freedom project, said, ''The law has long allowed minors to obtain confidential health care services in such areas as mental health, substance abuse or abortion.'' Without such protections, she said, minors will not receive the care they need.</p>
        <p>In the last month, Mr. Thompson expressed concern that the rules could impose a ''tremendous burden'' and cost on health care providers. At a news conference just three days ago, he said the effective date of the rules would probably be delayed.</p>
        <p>In an interview today, Mr. Thompson said: ''I have not changed my opinion with regard to the need for changes. There has to be some fix-up of the rules to inject a greater degree of common sense.''</p>
        <p>The A.C.L.U. and the American Psychoanalytic Association had threatened to sue the government if it delayed the rules.</p>
        <p>James C. Pyles, a health care lawyer who had already drafted the complaint for such a lawsuit, said: ''The Bush administration was vulnerable legally and politically if it blocked the privacy rules. The rules were mandated by statute, and the administration could not ignore an unequivocal directive from Congress, which said the rules should have been issued by Feb. 21, 2000.''</p>
        <p>Under the rules, hospitals and other health care providers can disclose no more than the minimum amount of information necessary to accomplish a specific purpose. Hospital executives said a strict reading of this standard could harm patients by limiting the free flow of information among people who care for patients.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thompson said the government would address this concern. ''Doctors and hospitals will have access to necessary medical information about a patient they are treating, and they will be able to consult with other physicians and specialists regarding a patient's care,'' he said.</p>
