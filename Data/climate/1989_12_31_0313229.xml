        <p>LEAD: To the Editor:</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Gordon Adams's ''Defense Cuts: Little Pain, Modest Gain'' (Op-Ed, Dec. 4) still puts the problems in terms of a relief effort for displaced defense workers and accepts as given a budget cut whose small size was set by the Pentagon. Meanwhile, President Bush promises that any cuts would go to reducing a budget deficit essentially caused by the Administration of which he was part.</p>
        <p>These are disastrous prescriptions. Rather, a very substantial cut is required, because there is no other way to tackle the national agenda that the neglect of the last nine years has thrust upon us. At a minimum, its technical-industrial parts would have to include (1) industrial recovery so that we may produce at least some of the goods for which we have come to depend on imports, with ruinous effect on our finances; (2) restoring a crumbling infrastructure, and (3) a start on reorganizing our energy use to cope with global warming and other environmental destruction.</p>
        <p>If only the small amount that Mr. Adams projects is shaken loose and if even that goes toward Mr. Bush's budget deficit, our technical, industrial and economic capabilities will sink below the level required to reverse our national decline. This may well happen, but at least we ought to be aware of what we are doing to ourselves. JOHN E. ULLMANN  Hempstead, L.I., Dec. 12, 1989  The writer, professor of management at Hofstra University, is the author of ''The Prospect of American Industrial Recovery'' and ''The Anatomy of Industrial Decline.''</p>
