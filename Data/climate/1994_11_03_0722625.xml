        <p>One place to measure the disheveled state of Eastern Europe's environment these days is a great electronic scoreboard in Usti nad Labem, a Czech town on a bend of the Elbe River.</p>
        <p>New sensors are sniffing the bad breath coming off the local factories and on the scoreboard, the people of Usti can track the gases they inhale as if following an important sports event.</p>
        <p>"We still get about 20 types of harmful substances," said Zdenek Cerny, a former army officer in charge of the monitors. "Suddenly half the town may get pains in the joints. Or skin problems. When these chemicals interact, it creates a kind of nerve gas."</p>
        <p>Usti's air and its color-coded scoreboard showing the ups and downs of nine different gases is even bringing it fame. Air quality specialists from Japan, the United States and Western Europe have flocked here like tourists visiting a chamber of horrors.</p>
        <p>"When they have just 10 percent of what we get," Mr. Cerny said, "they think they have a disaster."</p>
        <p>The scene is repeated across Eastern Europe as new Western computers probe the haze over Budapest in Hungary or the dust and soot over Cracow in Poland and Sofia in Bulgaria. The onset of capitalism has not cleaned the region's foul air, soil or water. But its instruments are now measuring it.</p>
        <p>The stark message of the sensors is that almost five years after the collapse of Communism, the region's environment continues to decay. Chemical works, smelters, coal mines and power plants are still infusing air and water with waste far surpassing international standards and causing severe health problems. Toxic dumps go on poisoning ground water and cities keep on spewing their raw sewage into rivers.</p>
        <p>What's more, capitalism is bringing its own problems -- more traffic pollution, less public transportation, more plastic foam, more clashes between environmentalists and the peddlers of consumerism.</p>
        <p>There have been some gains. Factory emissions have dropped, perversely the result of a sputtering economy in which many plants have closed or slowed production. But the enormous task of installing filters, scrubbers and treatment plants has barely begun. And energy still comes largely from highly polluting brown coal.</p>
        <p>"Achievements?" a discouraged World Bank consultant wondered aloud. "They are few, rather fragile and very dispersed."</p>
        <p>The main reason for this slow pace is that regional leaders insist that given the urgency of economic recovery, the environment must wait. This policy decision underscores a fundamental question facing Eastern Europe as it continues its transformation. Should anti-pollution devices, fines and taxes be further postponed in order to protect factories and jobs? Or will this bring more health and clean-up costs in the future, not only to restore the havoc of the past but also the new damage still being caused today?</p>
        <p>"The modern notion that development and environmental protection should go together has not reached here," said Lutchezar Toshev, the head of Bulgaria's environmental group Ecoglasnost.</p>
        <p>In theory Communism, with its strict central planning, had more power than free-wheeling capitalism to avoid or prevent damaging nature. Yet with its squandering of raw materials and energy, the economic artifice made in Moscow produced exceptional levels of pollution that maimed many of its citizens.</p>
        <p>In the end, it was this poisoning that provided a rare platform for challenging the state when other forms of protest were not tolerated. The environmental devastation became a powerful catalyst as citizens' groups formed throughout the East, spurring broader protests before the fall of Communism. Almost inevitably, in 1989 the new leaders had to commit themselves to an urgent clean-up. And the West, looking on aghast as scientists and film crews swarmed over the badlands of Eastern Europe, praised itself for doing better and promised to help.</p>
        <p>But progress fell far short of goals, and many questioned why much of the almost $1 billion offered by the West for environmental improvement was not disbursed.</p>
        <p>Blame is passed around. Western experts say that environment ministers have no clout, that their staffs are inept or keep changing, and that lobbyists are inexperienced or easily discouraged.</p>
        <p>Many Easterners say that the West dallies, is overly demanding and spends too much on experts dwelling in expensive hotels, instead of giving aid.</p>
        <p>"Look at Kozlodui," said Radost Patera at the Bulgarian energy ministry, speaking of a nuclear plant deemed among the world's most dangerous. "Kozlodui gets more foreign visitors than our famous Rila monastery." Regulation Lax Rules Attract Western Plants</p>
        <p>A popular argument in the West is that the transition to more modern, cleaner and more efficient technology will inevitably cut pollution. Results so far have been mixed. Several nations have copied the strict environmental regulations of the West, but the main problem is enforcement.</p>
        <p>"Inspectors are not well-trained and not motivated," said Erica Bassin, a Canadian legal researcher. "And fines are low. There is little incentive to comply."</p>
        <p>In Hungary, for instance, eight giant Western corporations are already producing chemicals, plastics, detergents and cars, using the nation as a hub for exports to the east. Hungarians say there is no mystery about what draws these companies. A senior manager at a Hungarian chemical company called Borsodken, which has formed joint ventures with several foreign partners, said, "Foreigners come here because of cheap labor, because of lower environmental demands and the lower health and safety standards in the workplace."</p>
        <p>Dorog in northern Hungary looks like a typical small industrial town: old stone houses and vegetable gardens coexist with dreary high-rises. But Dorog has no typical mayor in Anna David, a determined, 60-year-old pediatrician. Noting that Dorog's children had three times more asthma and bronchitis than the national rate, she blamed the local factories, and in 1988 she founded an environmental group.</p>
        <p>In 1990, when Dorog held its first free elections since 1945, it elected her. With a private American grant, she hired a municipal environmental inspector. "You have to watch them all the time, the Hungarians and the foreigners," she says, complaining that the Richter-Gideon chemical plant, which has been acquired by Elf Aquitaine of France, so far is still not treating its waste water.</p>
        <p>She worries more about Dorog's toxic-waste incinerator, the only one in Hungary. Built in 1985, the incinerator was bought in 1990 by SARP, a subsidiary of France's Compagnie Generale des Eaux.</p>
        <p>"That French company thought it could do what it wanted," she says. "We fought for a year because of their pollution. We almost closed it down."</p>
        <p>One recent day at the incinerator, on the edge of town, where the air stings like tear gas, an official conceded that the plant's carbon monoxide emissions were 50 percent higher than the norms. "We are trying to improve," he said. "We will have to change the oven."</p>
        <p>Dr. David wants the entire incinerator to move because the prevailing winds blow its dioxin emissions right over the town.</p>
        <p>An official of French company said: "We're in the line of fire. They should be looking at the sulfur and the carbon monoxide coming from the local coking plant or from the chimney on every house." The Water Famed Rivers Become Sewers</p>
        <p>A fitting place to gauge what happens on land is in the water, and the main barometer is the Danube, the continent's grandest waterway, fed by myriad tributaries. The river is also the main transmission belt for waste, running the gantlet of discharge from eight countries as it sweeps through Central and Eastern Europe on its way to the Black Sea.</p>
        <p>Istvan Ijjas heads a regional study group and has been taking the Danube's pulse for several decades. Asked about changes in the past five years, he said Czech, Slovak and Hungarian tributaries were carrying smaller amounts of dangerous heavy metals because factories have slowed down or closed.</p>
        <p>"The drop is only small," he said. "We still have all the toxic heavy metals in the Danube." The run-off from fertilizer has diminished since its price was no longer subsidized, he said, but the load of detergents heavy with phosphates is growing.</p>
        <p>More troubling, he went on, was the Danube's rising level of bacteria and viruses. He blamed cities that have expanded sewage collection without building treatment plants. From Bratislava to the Black Sea, towns use the river as an open sewer, in the process contaminating ground water. Budapest alone, beneath its seven magnificent bridges, expels the raw waste of two million people, treating only 25 percent. In Western Europe, waste water treatment is mandated by governments.</p>
        <p>On the northern plains, rivers like the Oder and Neisse still move heavy with waste. German engineers said that the Elbe has improved since many old East German industries were closed. But the Vistula, Poland's main artery and principal dumping ground, is still deteriorating. Polish specialists said that because of the flushing of Silesian coal mines, the Vistula is now saltier than the Baltic Sea, into which it empties. The latest survey by the World Health Organization concluded that the water drunk in much of Eastern Europe is unfit for consumption.</p>
        <p>It also noted that the poor air and water quality contributed to the region's high rates of lung diseases like emphysema, asthma and tuberculosis, as well as hepatitis, lead contamination and low birth weight and birth defects. Acid Rain  Where Pollution Killed the Forests</p>
        <p>On the high plateaus where the German, Czech and Polish borders meet and tree stumps look as if they have been ravaged by fire, foresters have been planting new and hardy seedlings. Yet few young firs are surviving. In the valleys below, a phalanx of power plants and industries driven by brown coal are still spewing sulfur and soot, as they have done for more than three decades. This region, dubbed the Black Triangle, is one of the world's biggest makers of acid rain.</p>
        <p>These were once dense woods, but even the Soviet Army had to move its tanks and find new camouflage as the foul air killed the tree cover.</p>
        <p>In Berlin, Michael Roder, a Government environment official, recently recalled some curious Soviet-think. Instead of dealing with the pollution, he said, planners asked East German biologists to breed trees that were smoke resistant.</p>
        <p>"They experimented for 20 years," he said. "In the end, the sulfur always killed the trees."</p>
        <p>Along a 350-mile stretch, foresters are now trying to restore 300,000 acres of lost trees and prevent the rest from dying. They say these mountain forests are needed to retain water and snow, which now plunge down the hillsides, causing erosion and flooding in the spring and water shortages in the summer.</p>
        <p>Along the Erzgebirge, the mountain range that divides Germany and the Czech Republic, Czech workers are spreading calcium to balance the soil. Specialists say it has become so acid that even the aluminum trapped in the clay is released, further poisoning plant roots and groundwater.</p>
        <p>In Poland, Andrzej Szujecki, a former forestry professor and now deputy minister of environment, says he favors natural cleansing and regeneration. "But this will take decades," he said.</p>
        <p>While forest death so far had been worst in the southwest, he was now troubled that for the first time, trees were dying farther east, in the Beskid Mountains.</p>
        <p>In July, when the European Commission released its report on forest damage in 35 European countries, Czech and Polish trees headed the list, with over 50 percent of conifers and deciduous trees having lost more than one-fourth of their needles or leaves.</p>
        <p>The airborne sulfur not only kills the conifers, which normally live for a century. Doctors say the sulfur attaches to tiny soot particles that penetrate human lungs where it mixes with water to form a potent acid, damaging the tissues.</p>
        <p>According to the International Energy Agency in Paris, recent industrial decline has reduced energy demand by about 20 to 25 percent in the region and thus diminished the dust and fumes coming off the power plants. But specialists say the noxious load in the region is still enormous.</p>
        <p>The answer to many of the region's troubles, many agree, is to replace its filthy energy sources, but policies differ. In Germany, instructions have been clear: by 1996, the remaining coal-fired power plants in the industrial basin of former East Germany must either have devices to minimize sulfur emissions or close.</p>
        <p>In Poland the road is far longer. American aid has helped build a sulfur treatment plant near Cracow and Dutch utility companies have donated one at Belchatow. But once operating, these scrubbers will clean only a small portion of the coal that accounts for more than half the country's fuel.</p>
        <p>The Czechs, despite enormous and continuing controversy, aim to finish a Soviet-designed nuclear power plant at Temelin. Vladislav Bizek, deputy minister of the environment, said that in four years the country could obtain 40 percent of its energy from nuclear power instead of today's 20 percent. Today, 75 percent still comes from polluting coal and brown coal.</p>
        <p>Physicians and planners also worry about the coal pollution people generate in their homes. In winter, when a sour fog makes East European cities look like they belong in an old black-and-white movie, much soot comes from thousands of domestic heaters, stoves and boilers. While environment ministries everywhere signaled the need for a large-scale switch to natural gas, only a few towns have started.</p>
        <p>In any energy discussion, Western advisers hoist the banner of energy saving. Many reckon that simple measures could save between 10 to 25 percent. But achieving this is proving tough.</p>
        <p>The European Union is financing a center in Budapest to promote energy saving. It sends manuals to industry and practical hints to customers along with the meter readers. Its television spots, wrapped in rock music, say "You pay twice" -- for energy and for repairing the environment.</p>
        <p>Ian Brown, the Briton who heads the center, says changing people's habits is difficult because of a deeply rooted sense of entitlement.</p>
        <p>"Energy has always been extremely cheap and people see it as a social good," he said. "People have no notion that they are part of the problem, that they can do something. They think everything is up to the Government." In reality, governments may be as much a part of the problem. The Mindset  For Some, More Is Still Better</p>
        <p>How the missionaries of Western ways can run into obstacles is illustrated by the black eye that bankers recently suffered in Bulgaria. A team of specialists from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development spent almost a year on a plan to cut sulfurous brown coal fumes. Bulgaria, studies showed, could easily cut about 12 percent of its energy consumption by reducing waste in industry and power plants. The London-based bank, which uses Western government funds for projects in the former Eastern bloc, was ready to act.</p>
        <p>In July, a team from the bank, armed with the energy savings plan and a loan, called on Nikita Shervashidze, the Minister of Energy in Sofia. But the minister, indignant, said he would never sign such a plan, a team member recounted. He said Bulgaria needed more energy, not less. He wanted new transmission lines and a new power plant. The bank, in consternation, sent more envoys. In the end the team had to leave, a year's work lost.</p>
        <p>"That's the old-style thinking," the team member said, furious.</p>
        <p>At the minister's office, an assistant explained: "Mr. Shervashidze wants to sell more electricity so the utilities can make money. He wants to keep the coal mines open. We have 32,000 miners and the unions are very strong."  The Options Is East Europe Losing a Chance?</p>
        <p>The assumption among the Western bankers and business executives who are helping to shape the region's economic transformation is that the former East bloc should mimic the West. Most powers-that-be in the region agree, judging by their eagerness to seek membership in of the European Union.</p>
        <p>But many environmentalists -- scientists and economists among them -- question the race to simply catch up with the West and copy everything it has to offer. Already they worry that their culture and traditions are being swept aside by the new ideology of consumerism.</p>
        <p>"We have a lot of discussions about whether it is possible to avoid the Western model of overconsumption, whether we can avoid its excesses," said Vladislav Bizek, the Czech deputy minister of the environment. "We should at least get our consumers into good habits before they pick up the bad ones."</p>
        <p>Some Eastern Europeans even believe in a "third way" between Communism and capitalism. Specifically, they argue that the transition in Eastern Europe provides an opportunity to do things differently. For example, they say that Governments should now decide to build more railroads and fewer roads and license only products that can be recycled, contain the least chemicals or are otherwise the least environmentally harmful.</p>
        <p>They argue that the governments must act quickly because it is now that people are eager to buy new cars, photocopiers, washing machines and refrigerators. Once factories are churning them out to meet expanding demand, it will be far more difficult to impose new ecological standards.</p>
        <p>So far, however, this debate is at best theoretical. "The market is winning," said Zsuzsa Foltanyi, a Hungarian biochemist and coordinator of The Energy Club, a collective of environment groups. "There seems no room for laws that can shape the behavior of the producer or the consumer. Anything goes."</p>
        <p>In Prague, which brims with tourists, environmentalists complained of the garbage, the fancy new packaging, cans, plastics, foils and plastic foam that have produced a new kind of waste that may take a lifetime to decompose. The old Communist recycling systems for bottles, metals and paper have collapsed almost everywhere.</p>
        <p>Andras Lukacs, a geophysicist who heads the Clean Air lobby in Budapest is among those deploring the arrival of the West's car culture. In Hungary and Poland, freedom has brought 50 percent more cars, fulfilling longtime dreams of their owners but also clogging up the narrow streets, blowing leaded exhaust and thickening the haze.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lukacs said that in the cities, auto emissions, including lead and nitrogen oxides, are so bad that they are offsetting improvements gained by the drop in industrial pollution. Use of unleaded gas is not mandatory and despite pressure from environmentalists, even new cars are not required to have catalytic converters.</p>
        <p>The rush for the automobile is already eroding the vast network of trains, trams and buses, one of Communism's positive legacies. "It's one of our biggest frustrations," said Mr. Lukacs. "In every city the number of cars is growing and public transport is being reduced." In Budapest trams and buses carried 1.9 million passengers in 1989 but fewer than 1.5 million in 1993. In east Berlin, a tram ticket today costs 14 times what it did under Communism. Berlin had 300,000 cars in 1989. Today it has more than half a million.</p>
        <p>Green parties complain that as the East bloc turns its new leaf, Western donors and Eastern decision makers alike ignore well-known ways to recover like introducing renewable solar or wind energy or using less abrasive chemicals in agriculture.</p>
        <p>Hartwig Berger, spokesman of the Green Party in Berlin, was among the pessimists. "There was a chance for fundamental change in the East, a chance for a new beginning," he said, "but so far it has been squandered." Five Years Later</p>
        <p>Further reporting on Eastern Europe after communism will examine the lessons learned from the outbreak of ethnic violence that engulfed the Balkans. Previous articles explored the successes and pitfalls of introducing jcapitalism to countries long accustomed to state-run economies, and the challenge of forging a united Germany after years of enforced political and economic servitude in the east.</p>
