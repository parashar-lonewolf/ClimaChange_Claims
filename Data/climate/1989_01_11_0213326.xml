        <p>LEAD: To the Editor:</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The summary of my view of the relationship between the greenhouse effect and the 1988 heat wave and drought (''Scientists Link '88 Drought to Natural Cycle in Tropical Pacific.'' Science Times, Jan. 3) is misleading. It states that I agree with Kevin Trenberth's analysis relating the drought to equatorial Pacific temperatures, and implies that I believe the greenhouse effect is not yet a factor in heat waves and droughts.</p>
        <p>Every drought can be related to such climatic circumstances as the position of the jet stream, soil moisture, snow cover and ocean temperature patterns. That will be true even if the greenhouse effect greatly increases the frequency and severity of drought. Dr. Trenberth's analysis, relating equatorial temperatures, atmospheric waves and the position of the jet stream, is excellent and may have captured key factors influencing the 1988 drought pattern.</p>
        <p>Other climatologists will place greater importance on, for instance, ocean temperature in the North Pacific and antecedent soil moisture conditions. The ultimate test of theories about seasonal climate fluctuations will come when they are applied to seasonal predictions before the fact, not six months after.</p>
        <p>As I testified to the Senate during the 1988 heat wave, the greenhouse effect cannot be blamed for a specific drought, but it alters the probabilities. Our climate model, tested by simulations of climate on other planets and past climates on earth, indicates that the greenhouse effect is now becoming large enough to compete with natural climate variability.</p>
        <p>The model gives us a hot summer in the United States in the 1990's about 60 percent of the time, compared with 33 percent for 1950-79. By 1989 this probability has reached 50 percent in the model. Droughts in the United States increase similarly in the model. These are hard predictions, which will be tested in the next decade.</p>
        <p>We know from paleoclimate variations on earth that greenhouse gas changes have been a principal mechanism for large global temperature changes. Man-made greenhouse gases added to the atmosphere in this century are beginning to rival in amount the greenhouse gas additions associated with past climate changes from glacial to interglacial conditions. The observed global warming of 1 degree Fahrenheit in the last century is consistent with the expected warming from the growth of greenhouse gases in that time. I believe this empirical evidence, with the theoretical model studies, is ample justification for my testimony that the greenhouse effect is changing our climate now.</p>
        <p>There are many uncertainties in predictions of future greenhouse climate effects, but these do not alter the conclusion that large climate changes will occur in the next decades if we continue rapidly to emit greenhouse gases. I believe we should take steps now to reduce the greenhouse effect that would make good policy anyhow. Examples: phase out chloroflurocarbons (which destroy ozone and cause 20 percent to 25 percent of the greenhouse effect), improve energy efficiency (reducing dependence on foreign sources of energy and improving our balance of payments) and discourage deforestation (preserving the habitat for invaluable biological species).
