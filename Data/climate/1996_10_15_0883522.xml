        <p>The Archer Daniels Midland Company, long one of the country's most influential and politically powerful corporations, agreed to plead guilty to conspiring with competitors to fix the prices of two agricultural products and pay $100 million in fines, the company announced yesterday.</p>
        <p>The fine is by far the largest ever obtained by the Justice Department in a criminal price-fixing case, eclipsing the next highest by almost seven times.</p>
        <p>For Archer Daniels, the plea deal will bring to an end almost four years of investigation that began when Mark E. Whitacre, then a senior executive, agreed to act as a Government informer and secretly tape hundreds of conversations at the highest reaches of the company.</p>
        <p>But it will also push Archer Daniels and its chairman, Dwayne O. Andreas, into an unusual new position. After decades of being run as a virtual family fief under Mr. Andreas's iron-fisted control, Archer Daniels will be forced by the deal to provide evidence in the continuing investigation of Michael Andreas, the chairman's son and former heir apparent, and other executives.</p>
        <p>Lawyers for the company, based in Decatur, Ill., will enter the plea today in a Federal District Court in Chicago, Government officials and other people involved in the situation said. In the plea, Archer Daniels -- a food processing giant that advertises itself as the ''Supermarket to the World'' -- will admit that it fixed prices of lysine, a feed additive, and citric acid, an organic acid used in various foods and beverages.</p>
        <p>Under the deal, Archer Daniels will pay $70 million in fines for fixing lysine prices and $30 million for the citric acid case.</p>
        <p>The settlement resolves all of the criminal investigations of Archer Daniels, including accusations that the company fixed prices of high-fructose corn syrup and accusations that the company used cash payments and other illicit means to steal technology from competitors. Although the investigation of possible technology theft was also said to stem from recordings made by Mr. Whitacre, a Federal grand jury began looking into that matter only a few months ago, people involved in the case said.</p>
        <p>Justice Department officials declined to comment yesterday on the  agreement. Company executives did not return telephone calls, nor did the company's chief lawyer, Aubrey Daniel 3d.</p>
        <p>Since the time of Thomas Dewey -- the former New York Governor and Republican Presidential candidate who served as an adviser to Mr. Andreas when he was a lawyer in private practice -- Archer Daniels has been a strong political force.  With an ease that bred envy among other corporations, Archer Daniels navigated the shores between the Republicans and Democrats while helping to form this country's agricultural policies.</p>
        <p>Renowned for its generosity in political contributions, the company forged ties with politicians from Hubert Humphrey to Ronald Reagan to Newt Gingrich; in the 1972 campaign, it was $25,000 contributed to the Nixon campaign from Dwayne Andreas that ended up in the bank account of a Watergate burglar.</p>
        <p>Today, that influence remains. Robert S. Strauss, the former chairman of the Democratic National Committee who is still a political force to be reckoned with in Washington, is an Archer Daniels director, as is Brian Mulroney, the former Prime Minister of Canada.</p>
        <p>The company and the Andreas family have contributed heavily to the campaigns of President Clinton and Bob Dole. Mr. Dole is particularly close to the Andreas family: he has used company airplanes and when he vacations in Bal Harbour, Fla., he stays in an apartment he bought from Mr. Andreas.</p>
        <p>Through its close relationships to Washington's political elite, Archer Daniels has had a role in shaping Federal subsidies for grain exports and ethanol, a gasoline additive made from corn. Last year, the Cato Institute, a Washington research center, labeled Archer Daniels ''the most prominent recipient of corporate welfare in U.S. history.''</p>
        <p>Despite the prominence the company has achieved, some investors in Archer Daniels and lawyers for companies defrauded by the price-fixing said the admissions raised serious questions about its leadership.</p>
        <p>''The $100 million fine is shareholder assets that are being squandered to pay for criminal activity that never should have occurred,'' said James E. Burton, chief executive of the California Public Employees Retirement System, one of the nation's largest pension funds and an investor in Archer Daniels. ''Where was the board of directors?''</p>
        <p>The settlement's most burdensome aspect for company employees may well be the cooperation agreement. According to people with knowledge of the deal, any employee of Archer Daniels called by the Government to testify before the grand jury will be granted immunity with regards to price-fixing. Archer Daniels will be required to dismiss any employees who still fail to cooperate, these people said. Those terms apply only to those executives who have not already become targets of the prosecution, as Michael Andreas and other executives have.</p>
        <p>For Archer Daniels, many of whose executives have privately contended that the modern commodities markets are so competitive and open that price-fixing is impossible, having to back down and plead guilty  serves as the blackest mark for a company long used to getting its way in the corridors of power.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the company has long been successful in avoiding any admission of guilt on the accusations of price- fixing that have dogged its history. In 1978, the company pleaded no contest to charges that it conspired with two other companies to fix prices on contracts in the Federal Food for Peace program. In 1982, the Government filed an antitrust action charging the company had fixed fructose prices; a Federal judge dismissed that case for lack of evidence in 1991. And, in the last few years, the company has paid $1.5 million to settle class action suits contending that it fixed prices of carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>The company's financial power means that Archer Daniels will be able to pay its $100 million in fines -- as well as another $90 million it has agreed to pay to settle class action suits relating to the investigation -- without feeling much pain. The company has more than $1.3 billion in cash and liquid securities on hand; its profits last year approached $700 million and its businesses continue to boom.</p>
        <p>But the company of the future will be far different from the one that existed before the scandal, analysts said. Already, institutional investors have pushed Archer Daniels to open  its board to more outside directors, and another attempt to do so will take place at the company's annual meeting on Thursday. And, with no obvious successors in place for Dwayne Andreas, analysts expect the duties of company executives to change dramatically.</p>
        <p>''If there has been no process for succession up until now, these events will force one to be talked about,'' said Leonard G. Teitelbaum, an analyst with Merrill Lynch. ''There may be new titles created and job responsibility divided among new people. And there's certainly the opinion that some of these people who are new and brought in may not have the name Andreas.''</p>
        <p>The investigation began in 1992, when Mr. Whitacre, then the head of the Archer Daniels division that produced lysine, told agents for the Federal Bureau of Investigation about the conspiracy. He agreed to work as a Government informer, and for more than two years, Mr. Whitacre secretly taped thousands of hours of conversations and meetings in which price-fixing was said to have been discussed.</p>
        <p>But, after Mr. Whitacre's role as an informant was disclosed, Archer Daniels dismissed him, accusing him of stealing millions of dollars from the company in an elaborate embezzlement. Mr. Whitacre has said that he obtained the money as part of an illegal compensation arrangement, a charge the company denies.</p>
        <p>Regardless, his cooperation has proved fruitful for prosecutors. The Government in August obtained plea agreements from three Asian companies -- and three of their executives -- for their role in the price-fixing. Kyowa Hakko Kogyo of Japan and Sewon America Inc. have agreed to plead guilty; the Ajinomoto Company of Japan agreed to plead no contest.</p>
        <p>The Archer Daniels settlement serves as a cap on the career of Anne K. Bingaman, the aggressive head of the Justice Department's antitrust division, who will leave the department next month. Indeed, all of the 10 largest fines for price-fixing have been imposed by the Clinton Administration. After Archer Daniels, the second highest, for $15 million, was imposed just last month on Dyno Nobel Inc. for price-fixing in the commercial explosives industry.</p>
