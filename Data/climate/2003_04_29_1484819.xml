        <p>A man walking his dog in a Queens park yesterday afternoon interrupted a cold-blooded sunbather. It was at least three feet long. It was scaly. It had olive and brown stripes. It had sharp teeth.</p>
        <p>The man, Mike Georgatos, 53, called 911 to report an alligator on the loose.</p>
        <p>''It took me three times before they believed me,'' Mr. Georgatos said. His home, at 73rd Avenue and 224th Street in Bayside, is across the street from a busy section in the southern part of Alley Pond Park, a recreation area in eastern Queens with ball fields and a paved jogging path. ''The third time I said, 'This is where it is. Now, I'm no longer responsible.' ''</p>
        <p>The police arrived at the spot, roughly a quarter-mile away from one of the park's smaller ponds, and captured the alligator about 4 p.m. City parks officials identified it as an American alligator.</p>
        <p>It was turned it over to the Urban Park Rangers, who then took it to the Bronx Zoo Reptile House for examination.</p>
        <p>The city's parks commissioner, Adrian Benepe, said last night that the alligator was almost certainly abandoned by a pet owner.</p>
        <p>''We don't believe it's a sign of global warming,'' he said, ''but more a sign of the growing propensity of people to illegally abandon their exotic pets when they realize they're big enough to eat their child. It disrupts the ecosystem and is really a death sentence for the animal.''</p>
        <p>''It's just one more incident that reinforces the urban legend,'' joked Mr. Benepe, who promptly named the reptile Alley-Gator. ''There was no question about what to name it.''</p>
        <p>Tales of alligators roaming through New York City sewers have become an urban legend.</p>
        <p>And alligator have been caught in city parks before. In June 2001, a two-foot-long caiman was caught in Central Park, dispelling the myth that an alligator had been on the loose. And in 1997, Richard P. Murphy, the Queens parks commissioner, helped catch a four-foot alligator in Kissena Lake in Queens.</p>
        <p>Parks Department officials noted that the American alligator grows about one foot per year, up to a maximum of 15 feet long, but that this alligator was only about three feet long. However, as word of the alligator's presence spread through the park yesterday, the animal grew longer and longer in the telling.</p>
        <p>''I'd say it was four and a half, five feet -- yeah, five feet,'' said Mr. Georgatos, as his son, also a witness, stood behind him smirking and holding up three fingers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Georgatos said he came home from work at 2:30 p.m. yesterday and took his pit bull, Rambo, for a walk in the park. He began chatting with a U.P.S. worker on her lunch break and they both saw the gator sunning itself in the grass, he said. Rambo growled at the alligator, which countered by snapping his head around and hissing at the dog, Mr. Georgatos said.</p>
        <p>''That's when I said, 'Forget about it; It's too dangerous,' '' he said. He dialed 911 and a television news station, ''but they thought I was kidding too,'' he said. Then he returned to the park and stayed with the alligator when it tried to run, he said, for fear it might threaten the safety of Rambo and the children playing baseball nearby.</p>
        <p>The New York Police Department emergency services unit lassoed the alligator with a special pole and then taped its mouth shut.</p>
        <p>''They contained the reptile, caged it and handed it over to the park rangers,'' said Detective Kevin Czartoryski, a police spokesman. ''It's now residing in the Bronx Zoo.''</p>
        <p>The animal did not resist arrest, he said.</p>
        <p>''The alligator cooperated fully,'' he said.</p>
        <p>News of the alligator brought TV camera vans and news helicopters to the park. A troop of Brownie scouts from Floral Park screamed in unison -- some in fear, others in delight -- when told of the news by their troop leader.</p>
        <p>''It feels pretty cool that we have alligators in the park,'' said Paige McDermott, 6, a first grader in the troop.</p>
        <p>Mr. Benepe said it was uncertain whether one of the zoos in the city would adopt the alligator. ''I don't want to say alligators are a dime a dozen, but if this was Florida, it wouldn't have lived to see the light of day.''</p>
