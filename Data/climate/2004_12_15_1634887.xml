        <p>Fed Lifts Rates and Says More Increases Are Likely  The Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates for the fifth time this year and suggested that more rate increases were on the way. The quarterpoint increase, to 2.25 percent, pushed lending rates in the United States above those in Europe for the first time since March 2001.</p>
        <p>PAGE C1</p>
        <p>Warming as a Rights Issue  The Eskimos plan a legal effort to cast global warming as a human rights violation, which experts say could lead to suits against the United States or private companies.</p>
        <p>PAGE A3</p>
        <p>Martínez Says He's a Met  Pedro Martínez said in an interview that he had agreed to join the Mets, although the team has not yet confirmed it.</p>
        <p>PAGE C13</p>
        <p>Cargo Flights Added in Iraq  Responding to attacks on American ground convoys in Iraq, the Air Force is sharply expanding its airlift of equipment and supplies to bases inside the country.</p>
        <p>PAGE A18</p>
        <p>Retiree Benefit Costs Rising  Premiums for retirees who get health benefits from their former employers rose an average of 25 percent this year, a study says.</p>
        <p>PAGE A27</p>
        <p>3 People Attracted to the Gritty World of Boxing  Million Dollar Baby, a new film by Clint Eastwood, left, finds three people who grow close in a movie setting dating to the 1930s: the world of boxing, shown with a mix of sentiment and grit. This time, however, the boxer is a woman, played by Hilary Swank. A review by A. O. Scott.</p>
