        <p>The Ministry of International Trade and Industry said on Wednesday that it was increasing financial help to industries that must limit the use of substances that damage the earth's ozone layer. Ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons are to be phased out by the year 2000 and methyl chloroform by 2005 under an international agreement known as the Montreal Protocol.
