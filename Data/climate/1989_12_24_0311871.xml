        <p>LEAD:  THE FATE OF THE FOREST  Developers, Destroyers and Defenders of the Amazon.  By Susanna Hecht and Alexander Cockburn.  Illustrated. 266 pp. New York: Verso. $24.95.</p>
        <p>THE FATE OF THE FOREST  Developers, Destroyers and Defenders of the Amazon.  By Susanna Hecht and Alexander Cockburn.  Illustrated. 266 pp. New York: Verso. $24.95.</p>
        <p>FOR the past few years, much of the worldwide debate about global warming has centered on the devastation of the tropical forest of the Amazon. Already 10 percent of the forest has been destroyed, and its burning is now responsible for 10 percent of the world's carbon dioxide production. ''The Fate of the Forest'' is a journey into this devastation, the most senseless ecological disaster of our time. Written by Susanna Hecht, a botanist and ecologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, who has lived in the Amazon, and Alexander Cockburn, a British journalist who has been hailed by The Times Literary Supplement of London as ''probably the most gifted polemicist writing in English today,'' the book is not just about the forest itself but also about the greed of its destroyers and the fierce struggle of its supporters.</p>
        <p>To their credit, Ms. Hecht and Mr. Cockburn do not share the romantic and pastoral view held by the sort of ecological groups that defend trees more ardently than the human beings who starve under them. Nor do they take the paternalistic stand of the industrialized nations that, having burned their own forests, now think Brazil incapable of caring for the Amazon without some kind of international tutelage. ''The forest's fate,'' write the authors, ''will depend on the vision and the political sagacity of the people who live in it.''</p>
        <p>Without a doubt ''The Fate of the Forest'' is ambitious. It begins with the history of the Amazon - told with a few exaggerations - and includes a full and rather boring chapter on the intricate geography of the region. Then it offers a balanced description of the mechanism by which the delicate ecological equilibrium of the forest is being undone.</p>
        <p>''The Fate of the Forest,'' however, is primarily about the people who have left their marks on the Amazon. It leads the reader through a grandiose cast of characters - from American tycoons like Henry Ford in the 1930's and Daniel K. Ludwig in the 70's and 80's, who saw their expensive projects buried by the forest, to more modest actors such as the rubber tappers' union leader Chico Mendes, who lost his life a year ago while fighting the economic exploitation of the region and its people.</p>
        <p>Rightly, Ms. Hecht and Mr. Cockburn take straight aim at the culpable - the Brazilian elite. But in launching most of their attacks at the Brazilian military rather than the business elite, Ms. Hecht and Mr. Cockburn miss the mark. In Brazilian history, the destruction of the Amazon has gone on regardless of whether the military has been in power or not.</p>
        <p>The authors argue that the devastation of the tropical forest is a direct consequence of a geopolitical vision conceived by the Brazilian military - more specifically, by Gen. Golbery do Couto e Silva, who was the power behind three of the five generals who ruled Brazil from 1964 to 1985. It's true that the military did authorize depredations in the area. But the real force behind the destruction was and is found in the Brazilian business community, particularly the sector involved in the development of cattle ranching.</p>
        <p>In an effort to make connections that justify their scenario, Ms. Hecht and Mr. Cockburn practice what could be called ''orthopedic journalism'' - forcing facts into postures that suit their theories. For instance, the devastation of the Amazon forest, contrary to the authors' theory, continued after the military left power in 1985, so Ms. Hecht and Mr. Cockburn conveniently define the civilian government of President Jose Sarney as a ''nominal democracy,'' implying that it is a mere embellishment of the military. Wrong. Mr. Sarney's presidency is corrupt and incompetent, true. But it also represents the longest period of public liberties in Brazilian history.</p>
        <p>The authors also play fast and loose with the life of General Golbery, who lost his position in the Government in 1981. Golbery opposed some of the madder schemes for the Amazon, including the construction of a road, called the Perimetral Norte, that would have led nowhere. Since then, a derivative of this corrupt project, called the Calha Norte, has been started, and the authors contend wrongly that the General's ''shadow hangs over'' it. Golbery liked being perceived as a mysterious figure, and things were attributed to him whether he did them or not. But the authors of ''The Fate of the Forest'' have embroidered his biography a bit too much. He never fought in World War II - in either France or Italy - as they would have it, and when he actually landed in Naples the war was over.</p>
        <p>Other statements in the book are exaggerated or superficial, and still others lack adequate documentation. One cannot say that in 1492 there were 6 million to 12 million Indians living in the Amazon basin, or that ''it is likely'' that the figure may have been as high as 15 million, when a book cited in the bibliography refers to only five million Indians. Mistakes permeate all four centuries covered by the book. Even the current United States Ambassador to Brasilia, Richard Melton, is wrongly called Richard Murphy.</p>
        <p>Some errors in ''The Fate of the Forest'' derive from poor investigative reporting. Nonetheless, the authors are not intellectually dishonest. At a time when the international press and television praise Chico Mendes as a kind of Albert Schweitzer of the tropical forest, Ms. Hecht and Mr. Cockburn make it clear that his career as an environmentalist ''cannot be divorced from his active life as an extremely radical political militant.'' I suspect that the Hollywood producers who are now scurrying to turn Mendes's life into a multimillion-dollar script might feel uncomfortable when they learn about his past allegiance to the Communist Party of Brazil - an organization aligned ideologically with Stalinist Albania.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, ''The Fate of the Forest'' resembles some trees of the dying forest. It is impressive and colorful, but the roots are planted in barren soil.</p>
