        <p>LEAD: THE computer is becoming almost as common as the blackboard in the nation's classrooms, but most schools have yet to use it more inventively than they use the blackboard.</p>
        <p>THE computer is becoming almost as common as the blackboard in the nation's classrooms, but most schools have yet to use it more inventively than they use the blackboard.</p>
        <p>Although computers were introduced into the classroom more than a decade ago amid predictions that they would revolutionize education, experts say there are few classrooms where children are learning anything on computers they could not learn without them. Nor is there much evidence that the computer has dramatically improved student achievement.</p>
        <p>''So far what we've done is on the level of a disaster,'' said Alfred Bork, professor of computer science at the University of California, Irvine. ''The problem is how to get people away from the romance with the technology and how to get them to think about improving learning, and you can't do it without changing whole courses.'' Using the Imagination</p>
        <p>Still, experts say that where computers are imaginatively harnessed, once-passive children are directing their own learning and following their own enthusiasms. Computers are illustrating complex phenomena like black holes, DNA and the greenhouse effect in ways far richer than can be done with chalk. They allow students to leaf through large amounts of material in an instant.</p>
        <p>Since 1985, the number of computers in American elementary and secondary schools has doubled, to 2.25 million, or about 1 for every 20 schoolchildren, according to a survey by Henry Jay Becker, a Johns Hopkins University researcher.</p>
        <p>Some schools are tapping the computer to change what gets taught, experts say. Students in a thousand elementary schools are collecting acid rain samples and, with the help of sensors hooked to color computers, instantly graphing and mapping their data. Designed by Robert F. Tinker, scientific officer of the Technical Educational Research Center in Cambridge, Mass., the project allows students to predict how the flow of acid rain from industrial cities to woodlands affects the environment.</p>
        <p>The Bank Street College of Education in New York City has been testing an amalgam of a computer and a laser disk that allows students to explore an archeological site just as a curious tourist might. Operating a joystick that commands 70,000 film-like images of the Maya ruins at Palenque in Mexico, students can ''walk'' backward, forward or sideways through the site. They can ''call up'' an archeologist to tell them about a tomb or palace, view a text about Mayan hieroglyphics or hear the screech of the howler monkeys in the surrounding rain forest.</p>
        <p>''The computer is not in any way a substitute for a good teacher,'' said Karen Sheingold, dean of the Bank Street's Center for Technology in Education, but she believes it can pump vivid life into amorphous subjects like a Maya ruin. The Palenque program was developed by the center's Dr. Kathleen S. Wilson, a former teacher.</p>
        <p>Several Brown University courses use hypertext - a program that links hundreds of documents - to speed research while helping undergraduates grasp relations between literary, historical and social phenomena. The program allows students to call up, say, a biography of Tennyson, a Victorian timeline, an essay on Tennyson's technique or another discussing religious currents of the period and then to search more deeply in any of these areas.</p>
        <p>But in most schools there is little effort to overhaul the curriculum to tap fully the computer's talents. Instead, students will practice something like multiplication and have the computer instantly evaluate their answers. Indeed, studies show that most high schools use their computers merely teach students to operate and program a computer.</p>
        <p>One problem is that few teachers are adequately trained on computers. Many feel at home only with applications that mimic workbooks. That may be changing: the Chronicle of Higher Education reported last month that 23 states require some new teachers to demonstrate computer proficiency.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Judah L. Schwartz, professor of education at Harvard and designer of a program that allows students to make their own geometric theorems, thinks that computers are often misused. ''If someone thinks education is all about pouring knowledge into empty heads,'' he said, ''then you can pour it with whatever technology is available to them, with a blackboard or a computer.''</p>
        <p>And teachers may be uncomfortable with programs that emphasize independent work; it is difficult, after all, to test students who have learned different things.</p>
        <p>''The software available is relatively poor,'' adds Andrew R. Molnar, a technology official at the National Science Foundation.</p>
        <p>Computers have proved effective in teaching writing in the classroom, however. Young children often find the mechanics of penmanship laborious; word processing programs eliminate that difficulty, make a teacher's comments less invasive and simplify revision.</p>
        <p>So far, says Mr. Molnar, improvements in student performance have not been compelling enough to warrant an overhaul of education. But expectations of such a revolution may have been too starry-eyed. A more realistic assessment, Mr. Tinker said, would treat computers like a microscope. ''You can do biology without a microscope,'' he said, ''but it sure helps.''  IDEAS &amp; TRENDS</p>
