        <p>MOST of us, I suspect, still think of Antarctica as some faraway place having something to do with Adm. Richard Byrd, who in the 1920's established the first United States base there. But ''the kingdom at the end of the world,'' as it's sometimes called, is very much a major factor in the world's scientific and geopolitical concerns. This is the subject of ''Antarctica: The Last Continent,'' being broadcast tomorrow at 8 P.M. on Channel 13.</p>
        <p>Produced by Michael Tobias for the public-television station KQED in San Francisco, the documentary ticks off the relevant statistics. Antarctica is the coldest, highest, driest place on earth, spanning an area of millions of square miles. Under a treaty reached in the International Geophysical Year of 1957, 35 nations have researchers there, most of them studying the relatively unspoiled environment, which acts as a barometer for what has been lost on the rest of the planet. The treaty expires in 1991, and squabbling has already started on the terms of a new pact. For the moment, though, it is not unusual to find, say, American and Soviet scientists working together on a Polish base.</p>
        <p>The program begins in a harbor near the tip of Argentina's Tierra del Fuego. Carrying tourists, an Argentine icebreaker heads for Antarctica, the first step being a somewhat perilous 600-mile journey through the Drake Passage, where the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans meet. Reaching such key points as Esperanza and the United States' Palmer station, the documentary collects a nifty batch of travelogue images: sparkling waters, awesome glaciers, adorable penguins. Needless to say, we soon learn that there are serious problems in paradise. Documentarians are nearly always after something other than picture postcards.</p>
        <p>As the rest of the world impinges on the continent, the pressing problems of modern life can hardly be far behind. High on the list, of course, is pollution. The bases, with their scientific and technological equipment, are dumping garbage and chemical wastes into the waters. The tourists are often piggish and insensitive. The disastrous effects can already be seen on the surrounding plant and marine life. Of all the represented nationals, only the New Zealanders take their garbage home, according to the program.</p>
        <p>On a geopolitical level, Antarctica is enormously rich in natural resources - gold, silver, platinum, uranium, coal, iron and oil, not to mention the shrimp-like fish called krill, which some scientists see as the solution to any future specter of world hunger. Needless to say, several nations are already claiming a piece of this enormous pie. Argentina, with the largest number of bases, already has a considerable military presence and is pointedly hastening the process of colonization, talking all the time of Argentine ''sovereignty.'' Obviously, treaty negotiations in 1991 will be delicate.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, crucial scientific studies proceed. One segment of the program, seen several weeks ago on ''The MacNeil/Lehrer Newshour,'' describes how curious holes are appearing in the ozone layer of the atmosphere above the South Pole. It is a phenomenon that has been noticed only in the past two years. If something similar happened over the United States, we are told, the incidence of skin cancers could jump 80 percent.</p>
        <p>With Ken Ellis as executive producer and Robert Jimenez as narrator, ''Antarctica: The Last Continent'' doesn't just wring its hands about the increasing need for preservation. It presents with clear sympathy the proposal of Greenpeace, an environmental group, to make the entire continent a world park. Incidentally, the cost for an American couple wanting to take a trip on the Argentine icebreaker would be around $12,000.</p>
