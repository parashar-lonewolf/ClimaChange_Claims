        <p>LEAD: Two brothers have patented a new bottle for people who buy soft drinks in economical two-liter containers and want to drink them over time without losing the fizz. Working in their kitchen in Cherry Hill, N.J., Stephen and Robert Tullman have fashioned a bottle that they say keeps 68 percent of its carbonation several hours after being drained half empty, compared with about 19 percent for a conventional bottle.</p>

        <p>LEAD: Two brothers have patented a new bottle for people who buy soft drinks in economical two-liter containers and want to drink them over time without losing the fizz.

        <p>Two brothers have patented a new bottle for people who buy soft drinks in economical two-liter containers and want to drink them over time without losing the fizz. Working in their kitchen in Cherry Hill, N.J., Stephen and Robert Tullman have fashioned a bottle that they say keeps 68 percent of its carbonation several hours after being drained half empty, compared with about 19 percent for a conventional bottle.</p>
        <p>The key to the ''fizz factor,'' they said, is to prevent the soft drink's carbon dioxide from mixing with the air that flows in as the drink is poured out.</p>
        <p>The inventors drilled a 1/4-inch hole in the base of the bottle, inserted an ordinary plastic bag and sealed the bag's opening to the hole's rim so that liquid cannot leak out. When liquid is poured out of the bottle's mouth, the bag sucks in air to replace the lost volume but keeps the air separated from the remaining soft drink.</p>
        <p>Soft drink bottlers are still evaluating the idea, said the brothers, who have founded P.T.I. Inc. to commercialize their invention. The Tullmans received patent 4,881,666.</p>
