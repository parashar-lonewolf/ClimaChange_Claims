      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>To suggest that the Shoreham nuclear plant could have solved our energy problems [letter, May 6] is absolutely crazy. If Shoreham would have started, who knows what health and safety problems would have resulted? Long Islanders fought it because they did not want to live in the shadow of the nuclear menace and we knew that radiation causes cancer and reactors are complex machines that are not foolproof. The goal of those who opposed Shoreham was to ensure that we had safe, clean energy for our Island and this goal has yet to be realized.</p>
        <p>As a society we should be striving to produce power that is benign and renewable, not that is polluting and leaves a legacy of waste for hundreds of generations. Our environment is fragile and energy production is one of the most serious environmental, health and economic threats facing the citizens of Long Island. Our demand for electricity is growing beyond the current consumption and this is being used to advocate the construction of new gas-fired power plants. However, what we need most is long-range energy planning that looks to the future, not the past.</p>

        <p>Nuclear power was an experiment that was aimed at putting a positive spin on the atomic weapons program and providing peaceful uses for the atom. Long Island helped expose the foolishness of nuclear power and we can now lead the way towards cleaner, safer energy. Long Island has a sizable potential for energy savings from clean and renewable energy sources and we must aggressively tap it.</p>
