        <p>Editorial urges Florida to establish tougher building codes in wake of Hurricanes Charley and Frances</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Hurricane Amnesia is not the name of a storm. It's a form of memory loss that develops in the wake of a significant hurricane. The storm is remembered, especially for the very real suffering of its victims, but the lessons that should be drawn from it often are not. Thanks to Hurricanes Charley and Frances, Florida has had an unwelcome chance to rediscover things it has learned before. Preparing for a hurricane doesn't mean just boarding up windows and getting out of town. It means much tougher building codes, like the ones that several counties still have on the books. A tougher statewide code would mean tougher structures, and that would mean a better chance of standing up to hurricane-force winds.</p>
        <p>Every time a hurricane strikes Florida -- or any place else, for that matter -- it performs an instant analysis of construction quality. Nothing is foolproof, of course, but buildings designed to more demanding standards do stand up better to big storms.</p>

        <p>Hurricane Amnesia is not the name of a storm. It's a form of memory loss that develops in the wake of a significant hurricane. The storm is remembered, especially for the very real suffering of its victims, but the lessons that should be drawn from it often are not. Thanks to Hurricanes Charley and Frances, Florida has had an unwelcome chance to rediscover things it has learned before. Preparing for a hurricane doesn't mean just boarding up windows and getting out of town. It means much tougher building codes, like the ones that several counties still have on the books. A tougher statewide code would mean tougher structures, and that would mean a better chance of standing up to hurricane-force winds.</p>
        <p>Every time a hurricane strikes Florida -- or any place else, for that matter -- it performs an instant analysis of construction quality. Nothing is foolproof, of course, but buildings designed to more demanding standards do stand up better to big storms.</p>
        <p>And every time a hurricane strikes Florida, it creates a tsunami in the insurance business, spreading the costs to all the rest of us. Tougher standards mean slightly higher building costs, but that keeps the costs where they belong. Florida is a big target, and it sits right in the hurricane zone. That means it should be building in a way that is appropriate to the risk.</p>
        <p>Some people argue that global warming may lead to storms of greater strength and volatility in the near future. Florida cannot afford to wait to find out. It has already faced two hurricanes this year, and a third, Ivan, could be headed its way at the moment, with the potential of more storms to come.</p>
        <p>Damaging hurricanes have historically been intermittent enough in Florida to create an illusion of at least temporary safety, especially for a population that includes regular infusions of new residents who may never have experienced one. But it is not residents' responsibility alone to recognize that it is no longer good enough to rely on the illusion of safe enough for now. It's time for the authorities in Florida to start building for sooner or later.</p>
