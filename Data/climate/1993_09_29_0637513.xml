        <p>The four men and four women who lived in a huge greenhouse known as Biosphere 2 for two years finally emerged last weekend with a stronger claim to fame as a tourist attraction than as contributors to scientific knowledge.</p>
        <p>The vaguely defined goal of the $150 million experiment in Arizona, bankrolled by the Texas oil billionaire Edward Perry Bass, was to learn more about the earth's ecology and about how to establish self-sufficient colonies in space. The participants were to live almost wholly independent of the real world, breathing recycled air, drinking recycled water and growing their own food. Some half-million visitors to the project paid $12.95 apiece to watch them.</p>
        <p>But it didn't take long for the team to start cheating a bit, or sometimes more than a bit. A woman who cut her fingertip off and left for emergency surgery returned with a duffel bag of goodies. Oxygen had to be pumped in when breathing got difficult. A scrubber was used to remove lethal carbon dioxide. The hungry team members, who suffered severe weight loss and frayed tempers, were forced to raid a stockpile of food stored inside for emergencies.</p>
        <p>All that was understandable. Who hasn't gone camping only to realize in horror that the flashlight or matches were left at home, necessitating a sprint to the country store? But the biosphereans had a disconcerting tendency to hide many shortcuts until the press ferreted them out.</p>
        <p>With its reputation tottering, the Biosphere project commissioned an expert review last year and appointed a scientific director. But when the team emerged, the world was far more interested in the human drama than in anything learned. Were there any love affairs? (No one is telling.) Any babies? (Not yet.) How did the lady who abandoned her young child for two years fare? How much did participants fight? Would they have problems re-entering the real world?</p>
        <p>One interesting finding, mentioned in whispers but not publicly: Cockroaches and ants proliferated wildly. So maybe insects will inherit the world after all. But any apartment dweller in Manhattan could have told them that before they started.</p>
