        <p>LEAD: The world watching the Paris celebrations on television never knew: President Bush did not see the spectacular finale of a madcap parade in the Place de la Concorde shortly after midnight this morning, which is a pity for a politican who has so frequently expressed his reverence for the American flag.</p>
        <p>The world watching the Paris celebrations on television never knew: President Bush did not see the spectacular finale of a madcap parade in the Place de la Concorde shortly after midnight this morning, which is a pity for a politican who has so frequently expressed his reverence for the American flag.</p>
        <p>At the Champs Elysees entrance to the square and at its Tuileries exit, birthday-cake-like floats were bedecked with handsome Old Glories and with bubbly, make-believe American tourists waving tiny American flags and, in one instance, a sign saying, ''Hi Mom and Dad.''</p>
        <p>In a sassy boogie, the Florida A &amp; M Marching 100 - a band from Tallahassee, Fla. - pivoted around the obelisk to the sound of James Brown's ''Papa's Got a Brand New Bag.'' A fountain of fireworks erupted behind the wooden stands erected for the privileged few who could actually see the march-past of swiveling African dancers, Russians high-stepping under confetti snow sprayed by trucks painted ''Glasnost'' and British punks dancing under artifical rain.</p>
        <p>Although it was impossible to tell through the bulletproof shield on the balcony of the imposing Navy Ministry, the weary President of the United States had gone to bed. A Thrill on Television</p>
        <p>Yet those who watched the zany parade on television - by far the vast majority of French citizens, not to speak of millions elsewhere in the world - could have been forgiven for imagining Mr. Bush thrilled by the rippling Stars and Stripes, since television cameras had picked up the Marching 100 at the Arc de Triomphe end of the Champs Elysees well before they reached the Place de la Concorde.</p>
        <p>Like President Bush's pilgrimage through Eastern Europe before he got to Paris, the bicentennial of the French Revolution and even the summit of seven industrial nations that will conclude Sunday have the feel of events that have been choreographed not for people on the scene but for television watchers.</p>
        <p>There were a million people present along the Champs Elysees last night, according to the police, but only a small fraction of them actually got to glimpse the parade staged by Jean-Paul Goude, an advertising impresario who gives interviews with a baseball cap screwed backwards on his head. If anybody could translate America's television-driven culture into French it was Mr. Goude, who has an American mother and a French father.</p>
        <p>Yet President Francois Mitterrand, a 72-year-old man of letters who sometimes seems to have leaped straight out of the more serene 19th century, has shown himself to be no global-village slouch either. 'An Infernal Pace'</p>
        <p>''Francois Mitterrand is leading this kaleidoscopic event at an infernal pace, at once producer director and showman,'' wrote Serge July, editor of the daily Liberation, adding that the two-for-the-price-of one summit-bicentennial was a ''model of political Hollywoodism.'' ''The Americans, experts in this kind of patriotic orchestration, must be appreciating it as connaisseurs.''</p>
        <p>Mr. July defined this week as ''a gigantic television show'' and as ''a piece of theater in five acts that starts with 1789 and that ends with third world debt, drugs and the ozone layer, which is to say the great dramas of today.''</p>
        <p>By closing off swaths of central Paris to traffic - to protect his important guests - Mr. Mitterrand has created a giant pedestrian zone where tourists and Parisians stroll good-naturedly, but aimlessly, deep into the early morning hours. Yet, unless they repair to a television set, the only spectacle these latter-day sans-culottes can see are the fireworks that, Friday night and again tonight, criss-crossed and exploded in the black sky. Daily Stories in the Press</p>
        <p>The triumph of the televised image may not be a bad thing for this summit, which is afflicted, as drama goes, by an alarming degree of harmony on most issues and does not seem to be producing much of sensational substance. The European press has been doing its best to squeeze daily stories out of perceived or real snubs inflicted by Mr. Mitterrand on Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain, who had the bad taste of remarking before coming to Paris that the French Revolution didn't invent human rights.</p>
        <p>There was drama aplenty last Wednesday when President Bush appeared to speak at the Lenin Shipyard in Gdansk, the cradle of Poland's Solidarity movement. But then his media handlers realized that his speech was about to hit the local weather reports on the breakfast shows back in America; he was made to wait for four minutes so that he could hit the screens live.</p>
        <p>In real-life Gdansk, Mr. Bush's voice was silenced in English so that an interpreter could waft his words to a big Polish crowd in Polish; the American networks, though, relayed their President back home in English.</p>
        <p>Back home they never knew.</p>
