        <p>LEAD: Saving the planet is very much in vogue. It's also in Harper's Bazaar, Elle and Mademoiselle.</p>
        <p>Saving the planet is very much in vogue. It's also in Harper's Bazaar, Elle and Mademoiselle.</p>
        <p>It's the message on fashion runways, in marketing strategies, in jewelry and accessory designs, on shopping bags and totes, in advertisements and on price tags.</p>
        <p>A naked fashion model wearing a hat of birch branches and lichen, as shown in Vogue this month, may not be everyone's idea of environmental awareness. But the pervasiveness of ecological themes in the images and marketing of fashion is undeniable. It is also somewhat paradoxical.</p>
        <p>The fashion industry, whose driving philosophy involves encouraging consumers to discard the old (and sometimes still serviceable) and embrace the new (and presumably more stylish), is now trying to push itself to the forefront of efforts to conserve and preserve.</p>
        <p>The phenomenon goes well beyond apparel, to fashion in the wider sense. A SoHo furniture store sells only politically correct woods: tropical hardwoods are out. A Madison Avenue boutique stocks only cosmetics made from flowers or plants, including what it calls ''pure fume'' instead of perfume.</p>
        <p>This extraordinary convergence of commerce and ecology calls into question fundamental notions about consumerism, responsibility and, ultimately, fashion.</p>
        <p>Of 'Premeditated Waste'</p>
        <p>''The irony is that we're talking about a business based on premeditated waste,'' said Stuart Ewen, the chairman of the Communications Department at Hunter College. ''If you were to do a study of the history of product obsolescence,'' he went on, ''the model would be fashion. The first industry that built in disposability as a feature of economic survival was the ready-made clothing industry.''</p>
        <p>The environmental theme in fashion began as wispy touches and graphic exhortations in designer collections, not as some well-thought-out strategy of ''green'' marketing in which the environmental advantages of a product become part of the sales approach.</p>
        <p>Tendrils of ivy dangled from the ceiling at a Paris fashion show; a carpet of grass covered a runway in New York; models marched along in T-shirts or carrying signs all bearing slogans like ''Clean Up or Die,'' ''Save the Sphere,'' and ''Environmental Protection Agents.'' And for the last few seasons, there have been the new ''softer'' styles, to suit a gentler, less self-referential age.</p>
        <p>Leaves, Branches, Earth Tones</p>
        <p>Where once the symbols of conspicuous consumption reigned - black, gray and red the prevailing colors, broad shoulders and tapered waists the dominant silhouette, reflecting a culture anxious to project success, control and victory over one's surroundings - now Pan, with cloven hooves, was leaving his mark on the runway. There were dresses with leaves, accessories with branches, and, everywhere, earth tones.</p>
        <p>The environmental spin on fashion has now moved into the mass market, where ''clothes with conscience'' make an extra tug at the buyer's self-image.</p>
        <p>Apparel companies like Ellen Tracy, Esprit, Bonjour, J. G. Hook and Country Road Australia are now promoting efforts to preserve the environment either through their advertising, their licensing arrangements or their direct contributions to ecological causes.</p>
        <p>Bonjour, a jeans and sportswear company based in New York, has embarked on a program to ''change the individual's outlook toward saving the environment'' through educational tags. This summer, the first wave of what Bonjour executives said would be 50 million fashion items a year are to arrive in stores carrying tags with environmental tips from how to save water to how to reduce pollutants.</p>
        <p>''I don't know if our campaign will sell a single garment,'' said Charles Dayan, president of Bonjour International. ''But it's definitely not a fad.'' $90,000 Raised for Preservation Hermes, the French luxury goods manufacturer, has raised more than $90,000 for the Rainforest Alliance, a preservation group, at fund-raising parties in its stores around the country. Hermes, whose silk scarves are among the most popular symbols of conspicuous consumption worldwide, has declared 1990 the ''year of the outdoors'' and added a line of nature-inspired products, including a $175 signature scarf.</p>
        <p>Whether these tributes to nature will benefit the environment or even raise environmental awareness, with concomitant changes in individual behavior, is not clear. There is some skepticism.</p>
        <p>Professor Ewen says the new environmental symbolism should be viewed as part of an overall change in America's economy, from one built on industrial production of hard goods to one based on ''pure representation.''</p>
        <p>''Disembodied symbols, unconnected to material reality, whether we're talking about junk bonds, credit or information, are the primary product,'' said Professor Ewen, author of ''All Consuming Images'' (Basic Books, 1988). ''Going back to fashion, the environment has become a commercial cliche separated from real concerns. What can be attached to this year's fashion is merely the symbolism of environmental sanity.''</p>
        <p>Fake Furs on the Runway</p>
        <p>Green marketing is somewhat problematic in fashion. While a chemical company might introduce a line of more biodegradable packaging, apparel makers can offer little in the way of material improvement in their final products except to use natural fibers, and they go to great lengths to do so.</p>
        <p>Last week in Paris, Frederic Castet, a French designer, responded to the critics of fake fur, who say it is more environmentally destructive than real fur because of toxic chemicals used to make it. Working with a French textile maker, he showed the first faux fur fashions made from a biodegradable synthetic fur on the runway.</p>
        <p>''Some of these things are ridiculous,'' said Michael Leva, a New York designer who supports environmental causes. ''I don't see how you can design a collection that's kind to the environment.''</p>
        <p>Lester Brown, the president of the Worldwatch Institute, has one suggestion: ''If the interest in environmental matters translates into fabrics that can be washed instead of dry-cleaned, it would be a contribution.'' Some dry-cleaning processes use chlorinated solvents that are toxic.</p>
        <p>A Switch by a Master of Change</p>
        <p>But Mr. Brown added: ''We need to see some value changes that will weaken the effect of changing styles on people's purchasing decisions. To reduce the stress on the earth, perhaps we will see fashion move toward more durability and simplification.''</p>
        <p>The crux of the matter is not so much fashion's industrial processes as its underlying ethos of change. The more fashionable a garment is, the more likely it will soon be out of fashion. The influential Italian designer Giorgio Armani, whose New York store has sponsored ''Don't Bungle the Jungle'' benefit parties, is a master of such change.</p>
        <p>Mr. Armani, a proponent of wide sharp-shouldered ''power'' looks for men and women throughout the last decade, has reversed course in the past few years, removing the padding from his jackets. He is now moving instead toward the slouchy, more natural silhouettes of cardigan-like jackets for women and the Ivy League sack suit for men.</p>
        <p>It could be argued that if a man stuck with traditional tailoring for the last 10 years, he might have a closet full of serviceable suits rather than a group of outdated Armanis. But the fact that Mr. Armani is able to outdate himself so smoothly is the key to large-scale success in fashion. It thrives on change, but it must at least appear to be rational change.</p>
        <p>Lag in Clothing Sales</p>
        <p>Most designers and apparel executives, however, reject the idea that they consciously manipulate consumer tastes as part of a self-serving system of fashion change.</p>
        <p>''I don't do clothes to be influential,'' said Isaac Mizrahi, a leading New York designer. ''I do them because they're beautiful and I can't help it. When I picture the ultimate woman customer, she keeps everything she buys and donates the clothes at the end of her life to a museum.''</p>
        <p>Designers and manufacturers are already facing a fashion retailing landscape that has been slow for more than two years. Unit sales of most kinds of clothing are down, although price increases, based on the soaring costs of fabrics, especially silk and wool, have kept dollar volume high.</p>
        <p>''Things go out of style too quickly,'' said Norma Kamali, a designer who gave her most recent fashion show in Central Park, where models wore T-shirts reading ''Acid Rain Squad'' and ''Earth Children.''</p>
        <p>Emotions, Moods, Change</p>
        <p>''Fashion appeals to the emotions and moods of human beings,'' Ms. Kamali said. ''These change quickly. That's why we're in such trouble now.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Kamali suggested that there may be ''a whole new way of designing and presenting clothes'' that involves fewer designers and fewer stores - a shakeout, she said, that is already happening.</p>
        <p>Others doubt that environmentalism will inspire profound changes in fashion. ''You'll notice we're not pushing going back to the fig leaf and the Garden of Eden,'' said an executive at a leading New York fashion house, asking not to be identified by name.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mizrahi said, ''There will always be beautiful, luxurious clothes no matter how ecologically sound they are.''</p>
