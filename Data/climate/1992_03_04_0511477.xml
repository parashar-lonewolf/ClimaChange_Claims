        <p>THERE are occasions where it is possible to do well by doing good. This appears to be the case with Appliance Recycling Centers of America Inc. The company collects old refrigerators and freezers and removes the refrigerants before the chemicals can escape and attack the earth's protective ozone layer.</p>
        <p>In doing so, the Minneapolis company seems to have carved out a unique and profitable slice of the growing market for environmental services.</p>
        <p>The company, which had been closely held, floated an initial public offering of 675,000 shares last November at $4.50 a share. It has been drifting upward since, trading over the counter recently at more than $10 a share.</p>
        <p>By allying itself with companies willing to feed it old machines, Appliance Recycling has grown rapidly, albeit from a small base. From $1.6 million in 1988, sales increased to $5.3 million for the first nine months of 1991, the latest figures available. The company now operates six recycling centers in the United States and Canada, three of which opened last year.</p>
        <p>Earnings grew as well, to $428,000 in the first three quarters of 1991, from $25,000 in the comparable 1990 period.</p>
        <p>Recent scientific studies have indicated that the ozone layer, which shields the earth's surface from the sun's harmful ultraviolet rays, is deteriorating more quickly than previously thought. A family of chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons, or CFC's, is generally regarded as the culprit. The primary use for CFC's is in refrigeration, both as the liquid refrigerant and as a component of the foam insulation.</p>
        <p>Appliance Recycling's business is potentially a large one, although success is likely to draw competitors. Studies by the Environmental Protection Agency indicate that 32 million household appliances were discarded in 1990 and the number is expected to grow to 54 million by 2000. Not all of them contain CFC's, but most have to be processed in some way before scrap dealers will accept the metal for recycling.</p>
        <p>Recently the Bush Administration decided to support legislation that would phase out use of CFC's by 1996, even though an international agreement does not require ending production until 2000.</p>
        <p>Regardless of the deadline, the measure would affect only new production, not the millions of pounds of CFC's locked in refrigerators and freezers already in use. Until recently, CFC refrigerants were simply vented to the air as appliances were crushed by heavy equipment at landfills or when the devices were shredded to recover metal.</p>
        <p>The Clean Air Act of 1990 bans the venting of CFC's after July 1 of this year. Meanwhile, nine states either now or soon will ban the dumping of appliances in landfills, both to preserve scarce disposal space and to prevent mercury and toxic chemicals known as PCB's from contaminating the land.</p>
        <p>Appliances are not particularly welcome at incinerators either, because they are bulky, do not burn well and add to the ash that must ultimately be carted to a landfill.</p>
        <p>Enter Appliance Recycling Centers of America. Since 1976 the company has been collecting old appliances, mainly to separate out the 10 percent that are in good enough condition to be refurbished and sold. In the last few years, though, it has recast itself as an environmental services company, extracting CFC refrigerants from appliances before there is any danger of their being vented. (Some of the recovered CFC's are used in the appliances that are reconditioned.)</p>
        <p>It also removes mercury switches, as well as electronic capacitors containing PCB's, so that the residue left after the metals are recycled can be buried in an ordinary landfill. Under E.P.A. rules, materials even slightly contaminated by hazardous substances must be buried in costly hazardous-waste landfills.</p>
        <p>Appliance Recycling has been forging alliances with companies like Waste Management Inc. and Browning-Ferris Industries to dispose of the appliances it collects. The company has also formed links with such electric utilities as the Wisconsin Public Service Corporation, which are offering financial incentives to consumers to dispose of their old power-draining appliances.</p>
        <p>Now Appliance Recycling is going after another major source of CFC's, the foam insulation in walls of refrigerators, freezers and water heaters. CFC gas is used to convert liquid chemicals into the foam, where it slowly leaks out over time.</p>
        <p>Edward R. Cameron, the founder and chairman of Appliance Recycling, said there are no large-scale plants in North America to recover CFC from foam and no rules requiring their capture. But there are such operations in Europe, where concern about the fate of the ozone is more acute.</p>
        <p>Appliance Recycling has licensed a German process said to be capable of recovering 99 percent of the CFC in foam, and plans to install the equipment in its centers. The bet is that the company will be ahead of the curve if regulators ratchet CFC regulations tighter to include foam.</p>
