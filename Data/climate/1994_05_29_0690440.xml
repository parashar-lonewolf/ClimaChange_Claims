        <p>The panel set up to monitor international efforts to protect the environment has ended its first substantive meeting here acknowledging that much remains to be done to meet the goals set two years ago at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro.</p>
        <p>After two weeks of debate, the 53-nation Commission on Sustainable Development concluded on Friday that the international community was failing to provide the money and the know-how needed to foster environmentally benign development in poor countries and that rich countries should do more to restrict harmful consumption by their citizens.</p>
        <p>But the commission made no concrete decisions beyond agreeing to improve preparations for its next session, in 1995.</p>
        <p>It also made no critical evaluation of the reports submitted by regional organizations and governments, including that of the United States, on their environmental protection plans, despite hopes at Rio that the commission would become a kind of environmental world court. Resistance on Forests</p>
        <p>An attempt to pull together into a single plan various efforts to save the world's shrinking forests was blocked by Brazil, which appears determined to resist what it sees as outside interference with its management of the Amazon forest, the world's largest.</p>
        <p>In his summary of the meeting, the chairman, Klaus Topfer, Germany's Environment Minister, said he was encouraged that the two international conventions agreed to at Rio -- on fighting climate change and preserving the diversity of the planet's animals and plants -- had come into force and that a third convention, combating drought and the change of arable land into desert, would be agreed to "in a few weeks' time."</p>
        <p>But he said the world's efforts to finance the Rio summit's environmental goals had fallen "significantly short of expectations and requirements." He also called for "additional efforts" by industrialized countries to give poorer countries technology to raise living standards in environmentally sound ways.</p>
        <p>Mr. Topfer said northern industrialized countries in particular needed to take "additional measures" to change "those contemporary patterns of consumption and production which are detrimental to sustainable development." This implies a need for their citizens to reduce their energy consumption, for instance, and create less garbage.</p>
        <p>A major setback, in the view of many delegations, came when Brazil stymied an attempt by 17 environment ministers to start a coordinated campaign to save the world's forests.  Organizations Disappointed</p>
        <p>Private environmental organizations generally expressed disappointment with the meeting's outcome. "Results are middling at best and have not met the challenges of the follow-up to Rio," said Scott A. Hajost, international counsel for the Washington-based Environmental Defense Fund.</p>
        <p>"This is becoming another United Nations talking shop," said Maximo Kalau of the Green Forum, a Filipino group. "The ministers of economy and development who really count are not involved."</p>
        <p>Mr. Topfer echoed the view that by themselves environment ministers could do little to save a world threatened by the efforts of more powerful branches of government to promote industry, exports and jobs.</p>
        <p>At the Rio summit, heads of state and government from most of the countries in the world agreed that the program for cleaning up the planet and allowing poorer countries to develop their economies in an environmentally sustainable way would cost some $600 billion a year and require $125 billion annually in foreign aid.</p>
        <p>While rich countries promised "new and additional resources" and reiterated pledges to raise aid to 0.7 percent of their economic output, they have so far offered only $2 billion in new money over the next three years, through a fund called the Global Environmental Facility.</p>
        <p>Total aid remains at half the target figure, and little has been done to fulfill the vague Rio promise to help the developing world acquire environmentally friendly technology.</p>
