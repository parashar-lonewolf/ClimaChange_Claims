        <p>GLOBAL warming has no effect on the blizzard of Christmas albums, which starts with preliminary flurries as early as August and September and blankets the market in October and November.

At the same time, greatest-hits albums, quickie live recordings, reissues and compilations turn up to tempt holiday shoppers. Here, pop and jazz critics of The New York Times comment on this year's most notable holiday albums, along with a selection of hits, compilation and reissue albums. (Prices for the CD's range from $7.97 to $18.99.)</p>
