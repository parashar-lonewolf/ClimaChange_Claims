        <p>As expected, President Bush said today that he would join more than 100 other world leaders and attend the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro next month.</p>
        <p>"Today's environmental problems are global and every nation must help in solving them," Mr. Bush said in a statement. "As the U.S. has demonstrated over more than two decades, protecting the environment and encouraging economic growth can go hand in hand."</p>

        <p>As expected, President Bush said today that he would join more than 100 other world leaders and attend the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro next month.</p>
        <p>"Today's environmental problems are global and every nation must help in solving them," Mr. Bush said in a statement. "As the U.S. has demonstrated over more than two decades, protecting the environment and encouraging economic growth can go hand in hand."</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's decision came after months of internal Administration debate. For many months, Mr. Bush has been criticized by Democratic members of Congress, environmentalists and his likely Democratic opponent, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, for not embracing the Earth Summit and its ambitious envrionmental goals.</p>
        <p>Senator Tim Wirth of Colorado said the President "reflexively responds to the politics of an old world order while preaching the need for the new."</p>
        <p>Senator Al Gore of Tennessee, who has become an expert in environmental matters, criticized what he called the Administration's "policy of photo opportunities and symbols instead of real commitments." Treaty on Climate Change</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush said in the statement that he decided to go to the summit conference after top aides negotiated a treaty last weekend on global climate change that aims at, but does not set specific timetables for limiting emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases.</p>
        <p>White House aides said the President was advised to refrain from attending until conditions more favorable to United States industries were worked out.</p>
        <p>"Once the President committed to go he ran the risk of being presented with demands we would find unacceptable," said William K. Reilly, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, explaining the strategy. "The climate change treaty that we got owes a little bit at least to a desire that the President would attend and a concern on the part of other governments to make sure that the treaty language would be helpful to get him to Rio."</p>
        <p>Environmentalists said the treaty is a weak, but not worthless step toward stabilizing the output of gases they argue are rapidly warming the earth. Liz Barratt-Brown, a lawyer at the Natural Resources Defense Council in Washington said that much more aggressive steps would need to be taken to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other pollutants to prevent dangerous ecological disruptions. U.S. Given Wide Latitude</p>
        <p>The President's top environmental advisers, though, said the treaty set in motion a global process for stabilizing concentrations of gases at levels that were produced in 1990. The treaty also gives the United States wide latitude in deciding how to achieve those levels without injuring industrial development, Administration officials said.</p>
        <p>The Earth Summit, expected to be the largest gathering of world leaders ever, takes place in Rio from June 3 to June 14. The White House said today that the President's schedule had not been set. Mr. Reilly said the President was likely to attend the conference on June 13 to sign the climate change treaty and a separate treaty to preserve species that is under negotiation in Nairobi, Kenya.</p>
