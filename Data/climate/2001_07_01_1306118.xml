        <p>Michael R. Bloomberg says he supports the posting of surveillance cameras in New York City parks to fight crime, but thinks that another of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's more distinctive initiatives -- erecting pedestrian barriers to control jaywalking -- has not worked.</p>
        <p>The Republican mayoral candidate says that he would push for salary increases for teachers, police officers and some other public workers, and that layoffs will be among the last things he will consider should the city encounter tough economic times. Drawing a distinct if unstated contrast with the Republican mayor he is seeking to succeed, Mr. Bloomberg makes it clear that cutting taxes will not be a priority if he is in the corner office at City Hall. He declines, though, to rule out raising any taxes.</p>
        <p>Notwithstanding the fact that Mr. Bloomberg is seeking the Republican nomination for mayor, the candidate on display during a 70-minute interview at his sleek and spotless campaign headquarters last week appeared far closer to his Democratic rivals than to any Republican, including Mr. Giuliani himself.</p>
        <p>''I have little in common with them on a lot of the national issues,'' he said of the party he joined in anticipation of his first campaign for public office. ''But a lot of the local issues, you know, last I checked, most Republicans believe in taking care of others and being fiscally responsible.''</p>
        <p>Besides showing little appetite for building on Mr. Giuliani's tax cut plans (and saying that he, unlike Mr. Giuliani, would gladly meet with the Rev. Al Sharpton at City Hall), Mr. Bloomberg stressed his support for abortion rights, gay rights and gun control, as well as his opposition to the death penalty. And he said he disagreed with President Bush's push to drill for oil in the Arctic Circle and did not support Mr. Bush's decision to withdraw from the Kyoto treaty on global warming.</p>
        <p>At one point, Mr. Bloomberg even referred to himself as a liberal, as he said he disapproved of the suggestion by Alan G. Hevesi, a candidate for the Democratic nomination, that the city consider raising taxes to pay for improvements in the city's school system, should the economy go bad. ''I have a right to be a liberal; I pay a lot of taxes, and it's my money, and I'm happy to do so,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Through it all, Mr. Bloomberg dismissed suggestions that voters should choose a mayor based on ideology or political beliefs, pointing instead to his business experience. ''You either think that my background and my skills are what the city needs now, or you don't,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He spoke in a free-ranging discussion in a conference room at his expansive headquarters off Park Avenue, the latest in a series of interviews he has granted about his candidacy in recent days. The round of interviews is part of what his advisers say is a new phase in his campaign: an attempt by Mr. Bloomberg to fill in details about his political views and positions, many of which are unknown even to them. It is also part of an effort to present Mr. Bloomberg, who has had a very unsteady jump out of the gate these last few weeks, as being in command of issues that he will talk about again and again in the months ahead.</p>
        <p>All of his opponents are public fixtures in New York, and their views and records in office are comparatively better known. Alone among the six major candidates in the two parties, including his rival for the Republican nomination, Herman Badillo, Mr. Bloomberg decided against making the traditional announcement speech in which candidates typically lay out their campaign themes.</p>
        <p>He sipped coffee during the interview, attended by a single aide. He kept his jacket button fastened  throughout the discussion. He was expansive, though he spoke at a pace that was rapid even by New York standards. He grew animated at one point when the subject turned to criticism of his decision to forgo the city's campaign finance system and use his own money to pay for his campaign.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bloomberg, the former executive director of Bloomberg L.P., the giant financial information and media company, said he was prepared to spend a large amount of money, but he would not give a figure. His rivals say he has been spending close to $1 million a week on television advertisements. Yet he said he did not think it was possible to win with television advertisements alone.</p>
        <p>''You cannot buy an election,'' he declared. ''The statistics of self-financed candidates say three out of four lose. And the public is not that stupid.'' He added, ''What money does is buy you media access to get your message out.''</p>
        <p>Even with that, he continued, ''You have to be out there, talking to people, shaking hands, giving speeches, debating eventually.''</p>
        <p>In the course of the interview, he took pains not to criticize Mr. Giuliani, whose endorsement he is actively seeking, even as he suggested ways that he would be a different mayor.</p>
        <p>''I have a very different style,'' Mr. Bloomberg said. ''Look, I don't want to knock Rudy. Rudy is very good in a crowd. If I were him, what I would have done -- or what I will do -- is to focus an awful lot more on building bridges, if you will.''</p>
        <p>He did distinguish himself from the Democratic candidates in one area, saying he did not believe that police used racial profiling to identify suspects, though he acknowledged that many residents say such police abuses are widespread.</p>
        <p>''There is no question that they fear them, but as Rudy would say, the numbers show that they have no reason to fear them,'' he said. ''Rudy can make the case that not only have the police delivered lower crime, but they are under control. Having said that, it is also true that a vast, that a large percentage of the population does not feel as safe with the police, thinks that the police are too aggressive.''</p>
        <p>He said he was enjoying his first run for public office. ''The other night,'' he said, ''I was out there on Staten Island, and I thought, it will be really sad if you lose, because I love every minute of it.''</p>
        <p>But he expressed frustration with some aspects of New York politics, like candidates' tendency to talk about national and international matters.</p>
        <p>''Mayoral candidates should talk about what they can do in the city, with the money that is available, with the political clout, or the power given them by the City Charter,'' he said. ''And if they spent their time on that and let those we elected to the federal government focus on national issues, we'd all be better off.</p>
        <p>''I'm sure that Chuck and Hillary have opinions on traffic in New York City, but they should focus on immigration,'' he went on, referring to Senator Charles E. Schumer and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton. ''If you want to focus on immigration, run for federal office. If you want to focus on traffic, run for city office. Come on! It's easy to talk about somebody else's problem. That's why things don't get done.''</p>
        <p>Asked why, if those were his views, he visited with Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel here last week in a meeting that was announced on his daily campaign schedule, Mr. Bloomberg responded: ''He's a world leader, he's interesting. Why not go? Did I tell him how to run Israel's government? No.''</p>
        <p>His remarks reflected one major challenge he faces: to emphasize his Democratic views in a city that is overwhelmingly Democratic, without losing sight of the fact that he has to win an unpredictable Republican primary that involves a far smaller and more conservative segment of New York's electorate. Indeed, the state Conservative Party is about to begin broadcasting a 10-second television advertisement that mocks Mr. Bloomberg for suggesting last week that the job of a sanitation worker was more hazardous than that of a police officer.</p>
        <p>He left little doubt that his decision to switch party registration was born of pragmatism rather than philosophy, after he considered the chances of winning the nomination of the party he had belonged to for most of his life. ''I certainly looked at it very carefully,'' he said. ''An outsider would have no chance of getting through.''</p>
