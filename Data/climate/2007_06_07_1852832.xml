        <p>The presidents of nine universities in New York City promised yesterday to cut greenhouse gas emissions from their campuses by 30 percent over the next 10 years. The pledges, made during a news conference at Pratt Institute, came in response to a challenge by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who has set the same objectives for all city-owned buildings as part of his environmental sustainability plan for the city. According to a city study, buildings account for nearly 80 percent of the city's greenhouse gas emissions, which have been linked to global warming. The participating schools are Barnard, Columbia, Cooper Union, all 23 campuses of the City University of New York, Fordham, New York University, Pratt, St. John's University and the New School. Asked if the retrofits might require tuition increases, the president of one university said it was a possibility; others said they would seek other financing.</p>
