        <p>LEAD: President Reagan arrived here today on a cold and rainy day for his third summit meeting with Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and, as it happened, encountered a chilly reception on the subject of acid rain.</p>
        <p>President Reagan arrived here today on a cold and rainy day for his third summit meeting with Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and, as it happened, encountered a chilly reception on the subject of acid rain.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mulroney insisted that recent proposals by the Administration to spend $2.5 billion over the next five years on acid-rain research did not go far enough. He said the United States must agree to mandatory controls on the sulfur-dioxide emissions that contribute to the problem.</p>
        <p>''It is a fact of life that our mutual environment is being savaged and we are doing it,'' Mr. Mulroney said in an interview on Cable News Network. ''Of course you have to act.''</p>
        <p>The Prime Minister forcefully raised the acid-rain issue at his first meeting with the President this afternoon and once more pressed for stricter control on the sources of pollution, according to a Canadian Government official.</p>
        <p>Acid rain is the name given to air pollution, largely sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, given off by the burning of fossil fuels and changed chemically while traveling through the atmosphere, falling to earth as acidic rain, snow or dry particles. It has been found to destroy freshwater plants and wildlife and is suspected of damaging crops and threatening human health. Both Have Political Problems</p>
        <p>Acid rain is the paramount topic for the 24-hour meeting between the two leaders, both of whom have severe political problems and may see the encounter as a way to increase their popularity at home.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Reagan, who met with Mr. Mulroney in Canada in 1985 and in the United States last year, this is the first trip outside the country since the Iran-contra affair surfaced last fall, and it gives him a chance to act the role of a world leader.</p>
        <p>But a senior Administration official told reporters this would be a ''summit without drama,'' and without major agreements.</p>
        <p>The two leaders met late this afternoon for 35 minutes, and Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, described it as an ''intimate session between two old friends.''</p>
        <p>''They are expecting solid progress on several points,'' he added, ''including trade, acid rain, defense, health and other issues.''</p>
        <p>The two leaders committed themselves at the meeting to ''close collaboration'' in research on AIDS, acquired immune deficiency syndrome, the spokesman said.</p>
        <p>On acid rain, the spokesman defended Administration efforts on research and insisted, ''This is not a problem we take lightly.'' He said the Prime Minister's critical comments today indicated the ''openesss and honesty'' in the relationship between Ottawa and Washington.</p>
        <p>In his radio address on Saturday, the President said both countries ''continue to worry about the consequences of acid rain,'' but that comment understated the Canadian viewpoint.</p>
        <p>More than 4,000 demonstrators who gathered on Parliament Hill here focused on the issue, carrying signs that said, ''Stop Killing Trees'' and ''End Acid Rain.'' Trade a Major Issue</p>
        <p>Trade is also a major issue at this summit, with the two countries deeply engaged in negotiations to create a free-trade zone between them. Mr. Mulroney is a strong advocate of this goal, saying increased trade would be good for both sides. But critics are worried that a heavy flow of cheap American goods could cost Canadians jobs.</p>
        <p>At the state dinner tonight, Mr. Reagan said that ''much hard bargaining still lies ahead in the pursuit of a free-trade agreement.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mulroney has also asserted Canadian sovereignty over the Northwest Passage in the Arctic. ''That is ours,'' Mr. Mulroney said on the NBC News program ''Meet the Press.'' ''We own it, lock, stock and iceberg.''</p>
        <p>The Reagan Administration has rejected these claims, saying international rules of transit should bar exclusive control over such waterways.</p>
        <p>The two leaders could not escape the shadow of domestic politics, and Mr. Mulroney said he sympathized with Mr. Reagan's problems over the Iran-contra affair. He also rejected suggestions that his own plunge in popularity has been caused by his policy of improved relations with the United States.</p>
        <p>Among those traveling with the President are Secretary of State George P. Shultz; Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger; Lee Thomas, Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and Clayton K. Yeutter, the United States trade representative.</p>
