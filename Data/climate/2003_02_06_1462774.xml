        <p>Questions are reportedly being raised about whether insulating foam on shuttle Columbia was problem-plagued formulation that NASA was forced to use because of ban on foam containing ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons; NASA officials say not only was foam looking less and less like cause of accident, but piece that broke off Columbia was probably not the problematic formulation (M)</p>

        <p>Questions were raised yesterday about whether the foam that came off the shuttle Columbia's external fuel tank was a problem-plagued formulation that several years ago replaced the original insulating foam used on the shuttle fleet.</p>
        <p>NASA had sought a replacement because the original foam, called BX-250, contained a chemical, CFC-11, that was to be banned in 2001 because it harmed the ozone layer. The ban on chlorofluorocarbons, or CFC's, was required under an international treaty, the Montreal Protocol, and the Clean Air Act.</p>
        <p>Last night, some NASA officials and Republican Congressional staff members said that conservative and business groups were preparing to say that the shuttle disaster was caused by the ban, because the replacement foam was flawed.</p>
        <p>But NASA officials said there was no possible relationship, for several reasons. The foam was looking less and less like the cause, they said, and they still use it on the shuttle fleet. They said the piece that broke off and hit the wing of the Columbia was probably the old foam, not the new, more trouble-plagued material.</p>
        <p>When it had trouble with the replacement foam, NASA applied to the Environmental Protection Agency for an exemption from the CFC ban, saying ''no viable alternative has been identified.''</p>
        <p>It gained the exemption in 2001, and still uses that foam in a few spots on the shuttle fleet.</p>
        <p>Last year, NASA officials said, the agency shifted to a new formulation on most of the external tank, avoiding harm to the ozone layer and the problems experienced with intermediate foam formulas.</p>
        <p>Parker Counts, the senior systems manager for the shuttle program at NASA headquarters who previously supervised work on the external tank, said that more than 90 percent of the body of the external tank is now sprayed with the new foam in ways that avoid past problems.</p>
        <p>He added that it was ''highly probable'' in any case that the foam that hit the left wing on this launching was some of the original formula.</p>
        <p>Mr. Counts echoed other NASA officials in saying that it seemed clear now that the source of the fatal fault lay elsewhere.</p>
