        <p>FOR big money managers who hope to substitute an ''n'' for the ''d'' at the end of ''greed'' and still come out ahead, help has come from the United Nations.</p>
        <p>Secretary General Kofi Annan rang the bell recently to open the New York Stock Exchange, part of the public unveiling of six new rules of sound investing developed at the United Nations. The rules say that environmental and social costs should be measured and factored into investment decisions.</p>
        <p>Sixteen managers of public pension funds throughout the world promptly endorsed the new doctrine and shook Mr. Annan's hand.</p>
        <p>Why is feel-good investing newly attractive to people with a fiduciary duty to make a profit? What has changed?</p>
        <p>Not much. There has been a gain of about one degree in atmospheric temperature since shares of General Electric went on the market in 1892, and about 100 billion tons of carbon, more or less, have been added to the atmosphere. It has been hard for the public to grasp the consequences of those figures. But a growing number of investors are beginning to believe that climate change will have repercussions in industries from electric power to insurance. The forces that could move coastlines, they think, can easily move markets.</p>
        <p>There are hundreds of newcomers to green investing, like the seven-year-old Portfolio 21, which invests in companies that have made a commitment to environmental sustainability. The fund, with a global portfolio stretching from railways in Japan to cellphone makers in Finland to solar-cell companies in Silicon Valley, has matched or bested the Morgan Stanley World Equity Index. Its most recent figures show a one-year return of 19.36 percent, compared with the index's 18.61 percent. Since its start in 1999, its annualized return is 5.77 percent, compared with 3.34 percent for the index.</p>
        <p>Returns like this have yet to produce a stampede of imitators in mainstream financial markets, where climate-change metrics might as well be astrological charts. Still, environmentally and socially responsible funds like Portfolio 21, NorthStar Asset Management, Green Century Capital Management and the Calvert mutual funds have higher profiles than they once did.</p>
        <p>Environmental investing ''is long-term risk management,'' said Leslie E. Christian, president of Progressive Investment Management and co-founder of Portfolio 21. ''Environmental factors are the ones with the most critical risk for the planet, people and companies -- and the greatest opportunity for investors, companies and corporations.''</p>
        <p>Public and private investment money and venture capitalists are marshaling billions of dollars to pour into companies pursuing alternative energy -- renewables like wind or solar power -- or clean technologies, like pollution-control innovations that make conventional energy sources cleaner. There is also growing interest in new insurance models to manage the new risks.</p>
        <p>In February, the Silicon Valley venture-capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers announced that it was creating a $100 million fund for green technology investments.</p>
        <p>This month, a report by the Cleanteach Venture network and Environmental Entrepreneurs, groups that are promoting green investing, estimated that venture-capital investment in new businesses they called ''cleantech'' totaled $1.4 billion in 2005, up 43 percent from 2004. The green investment firm with the biggest celebrity clout, in financial and environmental terms, is Generation Investment Management, founded 18 months ago by Al Gore and David Blood, former chief executive of Goldman Sachs Asset Management, who serves as its managing partner.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blood brought two other senior Goldman executives to the London-based firm, which pushes its environmental analysts to think financially, and its financial analysts to think sustainably. A recent Wired magazine article reported the firm had $200 million under management.</p>
        <p>Some pioneers in the business have billions of dollars under management. Domini Social Investments has $1.8 billion in assets in a half-dozen funds; it created the Domini Social Index of 400 companies that meet its categories of social and environmental responsibility. Trillium Asset Management, a socially conscious fund, sets an entry investment bar of $1 million for individual investors, says its Web site.</p>
        <p>What a difference two decades makes. Julie Goodridge of NorthStar remembers that, ''When the social investment forum started in 1984, there were 18 of us.'' Now, she said, 500 people show up for a meeting, including corporate sponsors.</p>
        <p>A new financial infrastructure is growing around them, as some investment firms and nonprofit groups have spent years trying to do what the new United Nations-sponsored guidelines urge: develop benchmarks and measurements of environmental risk and environmental performance.</p>
        <p>''As you well know, Wall Street is profoundly slow,'' said Mindy Lubber, president of Ceres, a nonprofit organization that works with corporations, environmentalists and investors to develop initiatives on such investing. ''But now there are 20 Wall Street reports studying the financial risks of climate change.'' These have come out under the auspices of firms like Goldman Sachs, J. P. Morgan and Sanford Bernstein, among others.</p>
        <p>Ceres has developed indicators to help companies measure their environmental performance, and a private firm, Innovest, has developed a ranking system similar to Standard &amp; Poor's bond ratings.</p>
        <p>''We can attest that it's been slow and hard,'' said Innovest's president, Hewson Baltzell. ''Our whole modus operandi is finding value drivers among these different things we call intangible values.''</p>
        <p>For every investment category, Innovest rates companies from AAA to C. Mr. Baltzell said that his analysts looked at environmental issues with no financial analysis included. ''So what our partners or clients do is combine our ratings as an input factor in their models,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But as investment interest grows, the difficulty of defining companies as green or not becomes starker. Domini's index is a benchmark for some, and Ms. Christian of Portfolio 21 said she would not consider nuclear energy investments.</p>
        <p>Yet other firms with a green sense, if not a self-applied green label, do invest in what they see as the next generation of nuclear plants or technologies to clean up the pollutants emitted by burning coal.</p>
        <p>In October 2004, Paul Hawken, an ecologist and entrepreneur responsible for the Smith &amp; Hawken gardening firm, wrote a sharp critique of many of these funds, saying their definitions of ''socially responsible'' were opaque at best and dishonest at worst.</p>
        <p>Fred Krupp, the president of Environmental Defense -- which has been advocating for and developing partnerships with industry to improve practices -- is more interested in the growing willingness of businesses to account for environmental issues.</p>
        <p>''The crux of the problem,'' Mr. Krupp said, ''is the disconnect between markets and the idea of valuing nature.'' In the past, he said, there was little effort to assign a financial value to environmental impacts for which the company could not be held liable.</p>
        <p>''What we've been doing is inculcating real dollar values into markets,'' Mr. Krupp said. ''These things are creating investment opportunities, so dollars are starting to flow.''</p>

        <p>Correction:  June 30, 2006, Friday  An article in the special Business of Green section on May 17 about investors who are environmentally conscious misidentified the authorship of the Domini 400 Index, which some investors use to find companies that support the green approach. KLD Research &amp; Analytics Inc. created and owns the Domini 400 Social Index, not Domini Social Investments. (KLD licenses the Domini 400 Index to Domini Social Investments.) A representative of KLD pointed out the error in an e-mail on Monday.</p>
