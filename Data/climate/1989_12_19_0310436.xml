        <p>LEAD: WHAT began in the last century as a Christmas hunting contest has become an annual count of North American birds that provides scientists and conservationists with incomparable data about hundreds of species.</p>
        <p>WHAT began in the last century as a Christmas hunting contest has become an annual count of North American birds that provides scientists and conservationists with incomparable data about hundreds of species.</p>
        <p>Now in its 90th year, the annual Christmas bird count began last Saturday as the first of 42,000 volunteers went out to record sightings. Under the auspices of the National Audubon Society, and aided by dozens of local nature groups, bands of bird watchers across the continent will count all the wild birds they find in a day. They will separate into more than 1,500 groups, each of which will cover a circular area about 15 miles in diameter. Before the count ends on Jan. 3, experts expect to record more than 66 million birds.</p>
        <p>For most participants, the Christmas bird count is just a fun way to spend a winter day. But growing numbers of scientists and environmentalists are finding a wealth of important facts among the data generated by the winter bird watchers.</p>
        <p>More than 200 papers based on results of Christmas counts have been published, most in the last 15 years. And scores of studies are under way, all made possible by the recent computerization of 28 years of bird count data.</p>
        <p>One of the most recent studies, done last year at the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology, examined 20 of the 30 birds on a list of species that could become endangered. This early warning list was compiled by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. The Christmas counts indicated that 7 of the 20 species appeared to be declining rapidly, said Gregory S. Butcher, director of the laboratory's population studies. Pesticides Called a Threat</p>
        <p>For example, Dr. Butcher said, the loggerhead shrike, which once had a huge range over North America, is now declining drastically all over its range. While experts had expected this because the hedgerows, woodlots and brushy fields favored by the bird are shrinking, the population is declining much faster than anyone would have predicted. Dr. Butcher suggested that exposure to pesticides may be an important factor in its decline.</p>
        <p>He also found that the seaside sparrow, which breeds on Long Island and winters in salt marshes in Florida, is declining dramatically as humans encroach on its wintering grounds.</p>
        <p>In addition, the study raised concerns about the spotted owl and Henslow's sparrow, a species that favors abandoned agricultural fields. These species ''may be in the most danger of extinction and should be top candidates for special research programs and for conservation action,'' the study said.</p>
        <p>Such information is being used to alert agencies and groups like the United States Forest Service, the Nature Conservancy, the Bureau of Land Management and the National Park Service to the need for land management practices that would encourage the birds now in decline.</p>
        <p>''The idea is to get the word out and get something done about it before the species have totally fallen apart,'' Dr. Butcher said. For example, he explained, the state parks and national forests might start a mowing schedule that would provide a desirable place to breed for the Henslow's sparrow and other species that prefer grasslands. Some Species Show Increases</p>
        <p>At the same time, the study showed that two birds that had been on the early warning list, the trumpeter swan and the white-faced ibis, are now increasing significantly, and that the Harris hawk, which had dropped in numbers in the early 1980's, is also bouncing back.</p>
        <p>Terry Root, an ornithologist at the University of Michigan's School of Natural Resources, used 10 years of Christmas count data to produce ''The Atlas of Wintering North American Birds.'' The book, published last year by the University of Chicago Press, maps the distribution and abundance patterns for more than 250 species of birds.</p>
        <p>By superimposing maps of environmental variables like temperature, vegetation and precipitation over the bird distribution maps, she was able to show that the limits of some species were determined by temperature. Migration and Metabolic Rate</p>
        <p>''These species go only as far north as 2.5 times their basal metabolic rate,'' she said, meaning that to maintain body temperature in cold weather, the birds will not raise their rate of burning fuel more than 2.5 times their usual metabolic rate at higher temperatures.</p>
        <p>Dr. Root said she is now trying to use the bird count data on a continental scale to study the effects of global warming.</p>
        <p>''If temperatures rise, the species that are limited by winter lows will be able to move north rapidly,'' she said. ''But those limited by vegetation will have to wait until the vegetation they depend on grows up. This will tear apart existing bird communities and create new ones, to what effect no one yet knows.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Root said her data can also be used by conservationists as a guide to establish preserves to protect threatened species. Since the maps show relative abundance of a species in different parts of its range, conservationists can protect areas where a bird is doing the best, rather than the edges of its range.</p>
        <p>Although Christmas counts have been available for nearly a century, scientists have been wary of using the data, in part because they were regarded as unscientifically gathered. The experts were concerned that in a race for the most birds, the thousands of amateurs might overcount or misidentify species. More Reliance on the Count</p>
        <p>But attitudes changed recently as more stringent counting rules and data checks were introduced and scientists began to realize that the count is ''the most extensive, longest-term, continuous and most geographically comprehensive data set in American ornithology,'' as Susan Roney Drennan put it. Ms. Drennan, a mathematician, is editor of American Birds, the scientific publication of the National Audubon Society. The society corroborates, compiles and publishes the annual bird count data.</p>
        <p>Other scientists share her assessment and have come to rely on the data base, which is far larger and more comprehensive than any individual scientist could hope to gather even with an enormous research grant.</p>
        <p>Carl E. Bock, professor of biology at the University of Colorado in Boulder, said the Christmas count data are ''ideally preadapted to address questions of why certain birds appear in particular places some years and not others.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Bock and a graduate student computerized a decade of data, under a National Science Foundation grant. In analyzing the data, Dr. Bock found that wintertime ''eruptions'' in the United States of birds that normally live in the evergreen forests of Canada were driven by feed crop failures in the forests. When the trees failed to produce cones for reasons not yet understood, birds that eat the conifer seeds came into the United States for winter food. These birds include the red poll, pine siskin, evening grosbeak, purple finch, red-breasted nuthatch and crossbills.</p>
        <p>In comparing the North American bird counts with data from Europe, Dr. Bock found that the southern movements of birds from northern forests seem to be synchronized worldwide, suggesting that some global climactic changes may be involved.</p>
        <p>Dr. Bock, who has done two dozen other studies using Christmas counts, sees a bright future for what is unquestionably the largest data base in the animal kingdom.</p>
        <p>''The counts tells us two fundamental things about birds: their patterns in space and their patterns in time,'' he said. ''For no other kinds of animals do biologists have data like these.''  From Hunting To Counting</p>
        <p>IN the 19th century, teams of hunters traditionally competed on Christmas Day to shoot the largest number of wild birds and mammals. Disgusted by the killing, Frank M. Chapman, an ornithologist who spent 56 years at the American Museum of Natural History, organized a Christmas bird count as an alternative.</p>
        <p>On Dec. 25, 1900, 27 bird watchers in the first count covered 26 locations. Last year 42,671 volunteers counted birds in 1,563 locations (40 of them in Central and South America). The counting parties are organized to minimize the chances of misidentification and limit the possibility that any bird will be counted more than once. Unusual sightings or inordinately large numbers of birds are checked by regional compilers before the data are sent to the National Audubon Society.</p>
        <p>When scientists use the Christmas count data to calculate the size of bird populations, they try to standardize the figures by taking into account the number of observers in each party and how much time was spent in the field.</p>
