        <p>Editorial holds concerns, while worth raising, do not outweigh merits of plan by Long Island Power Authority to erect 40 windmills off Jones Beach in Long Island Sound</p>

        <p>The era of clean, renewable energy has always been an appealing abstraction, the hallmark of a not-too-distant future that is forever stuck on the blurry horizon. But the vision has become clearer lately. Soaring prices for oil and natural gas and growing anxiety about global warming have helped to focus our attention, and now a real plan -- by the Long Island Power Authority, to erect 40 windmills off Jones Beach -- is helping us to envision what life after fossil fuels might look like.</p>
        <p>It's hardly surprising that people are upset. The first public hearings were held last week on the LIPA project, which would anchor the turbines, each 440 feet tall, in an eight-square-mile grid about three to five miles offshore. The objections raised were familiar but intense: that the wind farm is an ill-considered boondoggle that would make hardly a dent in Long Island's power needs, that it would spoil the view from one of New York's grandest state parks, vex and perplex fishing boats and be a vertical Cuisinart for migrating birds.</p>

        <p>The era of clean, renewable energy has always been an appealing abstraction, the hallmark of a not-too-distant future that is forever stuck on the blurry horizon. But the vision has become clearer lately. Soaring prices for oil and natural gas and growing anxiety about global warming have helped to focus our attention, and now a real plan -- by the Long Island Power Authority, to erect 40 windmills off Jones Beach -- is helping us to envision what life after fossil fuels might look like.</p>
        <p>It's hardly surprising that people are upset. The first public hearings were held last week on the LIPA project, which would anchor the turbines, each 440 feet tall, in an eight-square-mile grid about three to five miles offshore. The objections raised were familiar but intense: that the wind farm is an ill-considered boondoggle that would make hardly a dent in Long Island's power needs, that it would spoil the view from one of New York's grandest state parks, vex and perplex fishing boats and be a vertical Cuisinart for migrating birds.</p>
        <p>These are concerns worth raising, but they don't outweigh the project's merits. Marine navigation and bird mortality are technical issues that can be solved or lessened.</p>
        <p>The aesthetic problem is tougher, since many people will never be convinced that a bristling lineup of towering blades -- faintly visible on clear days but not at all on hazy ones, officials insist -- will be anything but industrial blight.</p>
        <p>It might help the naysayers to think more broadly about blight, to frame the choice as between windmills and smokestacks, whose environmental sins go far beyond being ugly. If the tidy harbor village of Northport, on Long Island Sound, can come to terms with the its backyard power plant, one of the dirtiest in the Northeast, perhaps Long Islanders can learn to tolerate the much friendlier towers they squint at from the South Shore.</p>
        <p>In the end, necessity trumps aesthetics. The country urgently needs to wean itself from fossil fuels. An offshore wind farm can do a small part to place Long Island in the vanguard of a cleaner, greener future.</p>
