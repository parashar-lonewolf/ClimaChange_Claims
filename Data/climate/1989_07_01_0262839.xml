        <p>LEAD: Alarming amounts of acid rain and ozone have been found for the first time over the rain forests of central Africa. These are not industrial pollutants, as in the United States and Europe, but stem from the annual burning of thousands of square miles of grassland by African farmers.

        <p>Alarming amounts of acid rain and ozone have been found for the first time over the rain forests of central Africa. These are not industrial pollutants, as in the United States and Europe, but stem from the annual burning of thousands of square miles of grassland by African farmers. This may be yet another serious threat to the world's dwindling tropical forests, and a spur to the feared climatic warming known as the greenhouse effect.</p>
        <p>Thousands of fires are set to clear the Amazon forest, fires which Brazilian scientists estimate are the source of one-tenth of the global production of carbon dioxide, the principal greenhouse gas. A team of West German scientists now reports that burning of the African savannas generates three times more gases than all the fires set in South America.</p>
        <p>These include the gases that create acid rain and ozone, as well as carbon dioxide. The scientists estimate that burning and the natural decay of vegetation produce a third of the world's carbon dioxide. The rest comes from burning fossil fuels.</p>
        <p>It's too soon to know if the acid rain and ozone will destroy African forests. The levels detected are dismayingly high, but the past pattern of exposure is unknown, and possibly the trees are in part accustomed to such toxins.</p>
        <p>The savanna fires do not directly destroy the forest, unlike the fires in Brazil, which are deliberately set to clear the land. A mere 0.6 percent of Amazonia was deforested in 1975, a horrifying 12 percent - 600,000 square kilometers - by 1988.</p>
        <p>Most of the destruction is prompted by cattle-ranching, yet Brazil derives almost no real benefit from this assault on its national patrimony. Cattle-ranching in Amazonia is uneconomic. Without heavy government subsidies and tax credits, almost all ranches would fail. Brazil's attempt to develop Amazonia, partly for reasons of national security, is a misadventure. The Government would save money by canceling its many subsidies.</p>
        <p>Elsewhere the remedies are more complicated. Tropical forests are ancient and irreplaceable nurseries of life, with great biological benefits for mankind. Unlike temperate forests, they regenerate only in centuries, if at all. They grow on mostly poor soils, which do not support conventional agriculture.</p>
        <p>Yet institutional pressures to destroy forests of any kind are often hard to reverse. Even in the United States, the Forest Service subsidizes destruction of the Tongass National Forest in Alaska, losing 98 cents on every dollar's worth of timber sold to a Japanese timber company.</p>
        <p>The destruction of the world's tropical forests is just such a tragedy. Governments often underestimate the value of the forests if left standing, and overestimate or fail to capture the very limited rewards of destroying them.</p>
        <p>If the greenhouse warming is for real, these follies will be the world's concern. Industrial countries will have to confront their own burning of fossil fuels, and help others to preserve their forests. But even forgetting the greenhouse effect, the puzzle is why governments in Brazil, Africa and Indonesia are squandering so recklessly the natural treasures in their keeping.</p>
