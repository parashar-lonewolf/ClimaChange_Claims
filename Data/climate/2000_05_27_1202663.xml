        <p>In a harsh rebuke to the Pataki administration, a state judge ruled today that the state has ''failed to come anywhere close'' to complying with laws requiring that it catalog clean air requirements and violations for hundreds of major polluters like factories and power plants.</p>
        <p>The judge, Acting Justice Dan Lamont of the State Supreme Court in Albany, found that the Department of Environmental Conservation had dragged its feet in complying with the laws. He ordered the department to greatly accelerate the pace of its work and complete it within two years.</p>

        <p>In a harsh rebuke to the Pataki administration, a state judge ruled today that the state has ''failed to come anywhere close'' to complying with laws requiring that it catalog clean air requirements and violations for hundreds of major polluters like factories and power plants.</p>
        <p>The judge, Acting Justice Dan Lamont of the State Supreme Court in Albany, found that the Department of Environmental Conservation had dragged its feet in complying with the laws. He ordered the department to greatly accelerate the pace of its work and complete it within two years.</p>
        <p>The department and Gov. George E. Pataki's office said this afternoon that they had just received word of the ruling and had no immediate comment on it.</p>
        <p>In 1990, Congress amended the Clean Air Act to require that each state determine which sites came under the act, based on emissions of any one of a long list of pollutants. The states were then to issue a Clean Air Act permit for each site, listing the emissions rules to which the facility was subject. The states were also required to keep on file, along with those permits, data on each site's compliance with those rules.</p>
        <p>The 1990 law also allowed for ''citizen suits,'' so that anyone could sue polluters for Clean Air Act violations. That, combined with the record-keeping requirements, created a powerful set of tools that environmentalists and neighborhood groups could use in court to enforce pollution laws when they did not believe the states were doing so.</p>
        <p>''For many of these facilities, it has been just about impossible to find out whether they were under any kind of air quality requirements, and if they were, whether they were in compliance,'' said Keri Powell, an environmental lawyer with the New York Public Interest Research Group. ''This law was supposed to make it easy for anyone to find out.''</p>
        <p>A state law for carrying out the federal requirements took effect in December 1996 and gave the Department of Environmental Conservation three years to issue all the permits. The department has listed more than 500 polluters; most are factories and power plants, but they also include gasoline storage sites, waste incinerators and even big commercial buildings, like hospitals, that have generators or incinerators.</p>
        <p>By last December, when the three-year period was up, the department had issued permits to just 21 percent of the facilities, a figure that has since risen to 29 percent. When the three-year clock ran out, the New York Public Interest Research Group sued the state to force compliance with the law.</p>
        <p>In court papers, the state environmental agency argued that the three-year limit was not an absolute requirement, and that it was free to use its limited resources in better ways.</p>
        <p>Justice Lamont strongly disagreed. ''D.E.C. has failed to come anywhere close to completing the permitting schedule established by the statute and its own regulation,'' he wrote.</p>
        <p>The state law ''is crystal clear and mandates that D.E.C. shall ensure that at least one-third of such permits shall be acted upon by the department annually over a period of three years,'' he wrote. ''D.E.C. is not authorized to disregard the clear mandates of the Legislature in order to pursue other activities which it believes are more beneficial to the public.''</p>
        <p>The state had asked the court to give it four years to issue the remaining permits, about 400 of them. Even then, the state maintained, it was required only to issue preliminary permits. The judge, instead, accepted Nypirg's proposal for a two-year timetable for issuing final permits.</p>
        <p>''This is a huge win,'' Ms. Powell said. ''It means the law will finally be put to work. People will finally know the status of polluters and will have the information they need to bring citizen suits.''</p>
        <p>New York did not enact a law for carrying out the federal rules until 1993, under Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. When the Department of Environmental Conservation first submitted its plan for carrying out the state law, under Mr. Pataki, it was rejected as inadequate by the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
        <p>Under pressure from the E.P.A., the state submitted a new plan in 1996, which the federal agency accepted later that year, starting the three-year clock. But by then, New York was one of the last states to have its program approved by the federal government, and one of the last to start issuing Clean Air Act permits.</p>
        <p>That same year, in a separate action, the E.P.A. issued a report that said New York was not enforcing the Clean Air Act requirements against known violators and threatened to take over the enforcement program from the state. The state avoided that by adding to its enforcement staff, reversing some of the cuts that had started under Mr. Cuomo and accelerated under Mr. Pataki.</p>
        <p>In the last year, the governor has won praise from environmentalists on air pollution issues, imposing tough rules on old power plants, adopting emissions standards for new cars and trucks and, this week, signing into law a bill intended to reduce pollutants that contribute to acid rain.</p>
