        <p>LEAD: DESPITE some improvement in the last 15 years, haze caused by air pollution casts a concealing cloak over the entire Eastern United States, routinely reducing visibility by more than 80 percent in countryside and city alike, a federally sponsored study has found.</p>
        <p>DESPITE some improvement in the last 15 years, haze caused by air pollution casts a concealing cloak over the entire Eastern United States, routinely reducing visibility by more than 80 percent in countryside and city alike, a federally sponsored study has found.</p>
        <p>The haze ''is everywhere'' east of the Mississippi River, said John Trijonis of the Santa Fe Research Corporation in Minneapolis, the chief author of the study report. ''You fly all the way down to Florida, you fly up to Canada, you fly to St. Louis, and it's there,'' typically cutting rural visibility to 15 miles from the 90 miles and more that would be possible under natural conditions - and that is still possible in some parts of the American West.</p>
        <p>But there are also encouraging findings. After a steady increase from 1950 to the early 1970's, the study found, haze has been reduced in the Northeast and Midwest by about 10 percent in the summer and about 30 percent in the winter, for a year-round average reduction of about 20 percent.</p>
        <p>Problems in Southeast</p>
        <p>And after an even bigger increase in haziness over the Southeast from 1950 to the early 1970's, the haze has essentially stabilized in that part of the country. In the 1950's and 1960's, when average annual haziness increased by about 60 percent in the Southeast (and summer haziness by about 80 percent), that region caught up with the Northeast and Midwest, where haze had been a major problem for most of the industrial age.</p>
        <p>Dr. Trijonis attributed the more recent haze reduction in the Northeast to a decrease in the burning of coal, and the stabilization in the Southeast to a leveling off of emissions from coal burning. He said further haze reductions could be expected in future years in both regions as new provisions of the Clean Air Act take effect.</p>
        <p>Differing versions of the new clean-air legislation approved by the Senate and House of Representatives would both substantially reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide from coal-burning power plants. Sulfur dioxide gas, when converted to sulfate particles in the atmosphere, has long been the primary cause of Eastern haze.</p>
        <p>For now, said Dr. Trijonis, the Eastern United States remains covered by a ''large-scale haze blob on the order of 1,000 miles by 2,000 miles.'' Only in Europe and China, he said, can similar broad-scale haze concentrations be found. The blanket is so pervasive, he said, that the haze over big Eastern cities can scarcely be distinguished from the broader rural haze that has become a more or less permanent regional condition.</p>
        <p>The findings were based on a computerized analysis of nearly four decades of visibility records collected at 137 observation stations. They are contained in the final version of a report that is being prepared as part of the National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program, a vast Federal research effort to gauge the nature and extent of the acid rain problem. Airborne sulfates not only cause haze but are also the main constituent of acid rain.</p>
        <p>Dr. Trijonis's company does air-pollution studies for the Government and private consortiums that seek to deal with the problem. Other participants in the federally sponsored study were Robert Charlson of the University of Washington, Rudy Husar and Warren White of Washington University in St. Louis, William Malm of the National Park Service and Marc Pitchford of the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
        <p>Of all the effects of air pollution, scientists say, its effects on visibility are probably best understood.</p>
        <p>''When you look at a distant feature, what your eye receives is a mixture of light that's been reflected from the target and transmitted through the atmosphere to you, and light that's been scattered through the intervening atmosphere and that appears as a diaphanous curtain or veil between you and the target,'' Dr. White said.</p>
        <p>The scattering that produces the veil, or haze, occurs when light is deflected by atmospheric particles.</p>
        <p>As light-scattering particles like air pollutants are increasingly added to the atmosphere, less light reaches the eye from distant targets and more scattered light fills the intervening air, creating the grayish characteristics of haze. The result is not only a reduction in the distance at which objects can be seen but also a loss in the quality of whatever image is perceived.</p>
        <p>''On a hazy day you might be able to see the outline of an object,'' said John Christiano, chief of the air quality division of the National Park Service in Lakewood, Colo., ''but you don't see the colors, texture and contrasts with the surrounding terrain.''</p>
        <p>In the national parks of the East, increasing haze has sharply reduced the quality of scenic vistas. ''The bluish haze that gave the Smoky Mountains their name is now more white than blue,'' Mr. Christiano said. ''The white is the result of light-scattering by sulfur compounds.''</p>
        <p>In the East, said Dr. Trijonis, about 55 percent of the haze is caused by sulfates. The rest results from other products of burning, from cigarette smoke to some kinds of automobile exhausts to backyard barbecues and old-fashioned soot, along with soil dust and air molecules.</p>
        <p>Season of Haze</p>
        <p>Summer is the peak season for haze in the East, Dr. Trijonis said, because atmospheric conditions then are more favorable for producing light-scatteringsulfates from sulfur dioxide emissions. For instance, large, stagnant air masses are more common in the summer, allowing more haze to build up.</p>
        <p>In the West, said Dr. White, no one pollutant dominates, and in any case there is much less haze. This is so, Dr. Trijonis said, partly because fewer sulfur compounds are emitted in the West and partly because the climate there is less humid. The higher humidity of the East means that particles in the air attract more water to them, forming larger droplets that scatter more light.</p>
        <p>Average visibility in the East is about 15 miles, while in parts of the rural West it is more than90 miles, the study said. As a result of this difference in visibility, said Dr. Trijonis, ''brown clouds'' of pollution over Western cities like Denver and Phoenix create a false impression that the pollution is much worse than that in Eastern cities. In the West, the urban pollution stands in sharp contrast to the clearer air of the countryside. In the East, he said, ''There's so much other smog around the urban smog that you can't see it, but those cities are often worse than Western cities.''</p>
        <p>The biggest exception to the Western pattern is in California. Average visibility in the heart of the Los Angeles basin is eight miles. In the Central Valley, visibility matches the East's 15 miles.</p>
        <p>Sometimes, Dr. Trijonis said, cleansing storms and weather systems clear away haze-producing pollutants in the East and the air becomes temporarily clear. But it is haze, not clarity, that has become normal.</p>
        <p>In fact, said Dr. Trijonis, Eastern haziness has become so much the norm that ''it's hard for people to believe'' that if all human-made sources of air pollution were shut down, ''everything would clear out in three or four days and there would be, on the average, 90-mile visibility.''</p>
