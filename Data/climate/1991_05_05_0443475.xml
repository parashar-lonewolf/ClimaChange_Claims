        <p>DISTURBING THE PEACE: A Conversation With Karel Hvizdala, by Vaclav Havel. Translated by Paul Wilson. (Vintage, $11.) In interviews with a fellow playwright, Vaclav Havel talks about the absurd theater of life, in which a former dissident like himself can end up President of Czechoslovakia. Last year our reviewer, Robert Brustein, said this book is "the finest work this Czechoslovak artist has yet produced. . . . 'Disturbing the Peace' leaves no room for controversy about his place in the moral pantheon of our century."</p>
        <p>FAMILY PICTURES, by Sue Miller. (Harper Paperbacks, $5.95.) Lainey and David Eberhardt seem to be on the way to producing the perfect family; then their third child is born with autism. "Opening out from the kitchen, the dining room and the bedrooms of a single house in Chicago, Sue Miller's book is as spacious and encompassing as any respected American novel," Jane Smiley said here last year. It is "profoundly honest, shapely, ambitious, engrossing, original and true, an important example of a new American tradition that explores what it means, not to light out for the territories but to make a home, live at home and learn what home is."</p>

"Opening out from the kitchen, the dining room and the bedrooms of a single house in Chicago, Sue Miller's book is as spacious and encompassing as any respected American novel," Jane Smiley said here last year. It is "profoundly honest, shapely, ambitious, engrossing, original and true, an important example of a new American tradition that explores what it means, not to light out for the territories but to make a home, live at home and learn what home is."</p>
        <p>THE FARTHER SHORE: A Natural History of Perception, 1798-1984, by Don Gifford. (Vintage, $11.) A James Joyce scholar speculates on how the camera, computer and other devices of the modern age have changed the way we perceive the world. "To the reader's great pleasure, Mr. Gifford proceeds by anecdote, by leaps of intuition and by quirky insight," Christopher Lehmann-Haupt said in The Times last year. "By forcing one to stare across the stream of his centuries, he has heightened perception of where everyone now stands on the present crumbling shore of spacetime." Vintage has also republished THE FIVE SENSES ($10), in which the Mexican-born pathologist F. Gonzalez-Crussi writes about the mind's portals to the outside world. When these essays were published in 1989, our reviewer, Anna Fels, called them "a lively and erudite series of anecdotes and reminiscences."</p>
        <p>AN INCONVENIENT WOMAN, by Dominick Dunne. (Bantam, $5.99.) A billionaire Los Angeles banker is afraid his mistress knows too much about the murder he conspired to cover up. Last year our reviewer, Jill Robinson, said Dominick Dunne "takes his speculations about the dynamics of power that mask most American tragedies and turns them into his best novel."</p>
        <p>THE WORST YEARS OF OUR LIVES: Irreverent Notes From a Decade of Greed, by Barbara Ehrenreich. (Harper Perennial, $9.95.) Marked by the rise of the New Right and the new rich, Barbara Ehrenreich says, the 1980's was a time when the only value that seemed to count was every man for himself. "These essays really express something much more profound than ordinary political satire," H. Jack Geiger said here last year. "Ms. Ehrenreich is making an important and impassioned argument. She sees right through the Kinder, Gentler Thing and focuses instead on what might be called the Thousand Points of Blight."</p>
        <p>FIRST LIGHT, by Peter Ackroyd. (Ballantine, $8.95.) The unearthing of an ancient tomb in the English countryside causes a mysterious rearrangement of the heavens. In 1989 our reviewer, John Crowley, said Peter Ackroyd "is adept at enriching his narrative with complex connections and evocations."</p>
        <p>SOWING THE WIND: Reflections on the Earth's Atmosphere, by Louise B. Young. (Prentice Hall, $9.95.) The best way to deal with environmental problems, this book argues, is to cut through the hype and understand the science involved. "Taking exception to the 'crisis psychology' of climate Cassandras, Louise B. Young has written a concerned but straightforward summary of the current state of scientific knowledge of such issues as greenhouse warming, acid rain and the depletion of the ozone layer," Timothy Bay said in The Book Review last year.</p>
        <p>THEN SHE FOUND ME, by Elinor Lipman. (Washington Square/Pocket Books, $7.95.) A quiet Latin teacher, who takes pride in specializing in "something no one cares about," is confronted out of the blue by her birth mother, the host of a touchy-feely talk show called "Bernice G!" Last year our reviewer, Randy Cohen, said this first novel is "deft and amusing."</p>
        <p>INSIDE THE PLO: Covert Units, Secret Funds, and the War Against Israel and the United States, by Neil C. Livingstone and David Halevy. (Quill/Morrow, $13.) Despite Yasir Arafat's public renunciation of terrorism and his acknowledgment of Israel's right to exist, the authors say, the Palestine Liberation Organization continues to use violence as well as diplomacy in its anti-Zionist campaign. Last year our reviewer, Barry Schweid, called this book "a comprehensive history and analysis of the organization."</p>
        <p>NOT THAT KIND OF PLACE, by Frances Fyfield. (Pocket Books, $4.50.) In a quiet little town called Branston, Detective Chief Superintendent Geoffrey Bailey and Crown Prosecutor Helen West find their romantic idyll interrupted when the body of a local woman is found in the woods. "The author creates savage portraits of the sort of people who feel at home in Branston and softer ones of those who are too young or stupid to make a break for it," Marilyn Stasio said here last year.</p>
        <p>SAY YOU WANT ME, by Richard Cohen. (Ballantine, $4.95.) An artist who stays at home with his son while his wife works as an oil executive has an affair with the woman he meets at the playground. "It is to Mr. Cohen's credit that he steers clear of a predictable conclusion, even if the one he comes up with is rather depressing," Mason Buck said here last year.</p>
