        <p>The urge to venture afar] arises from the threefold nature of man. One motive is fame, for it is the nature of man to journey where there is great danger, and thus win honor and praise. A second motive is curiosity, for it is also man's nature to see the things he has heard about, and thus learn whether they are as he has been told or not. The third is the desire for gain, for men seek wealth wherever they have heard that gain is to be gotten. -- FROM "THE KING'S MIRROR," A 13TH-CENTURY NORSE TREATISE</p>
        <p>WHEN HUMANS FINALLY ACQUIRED the technology to travel to another planet, it  occurred to them that they didn't really want to go. A manned mission to Mars, the fantasy that had paid the mortgage for generations of science-fiction writers, lost its appeal as soon as NASA plotted the itinerary. The $400 billion price tag seemed absurdly high to a nation bored with the sight of astronauts lumbering around craters. We already had enough extraterrestrial rocks, thank you.</p>
        <p>Recently, though, an intriguing modification to NASA's Mars plan has been suggested: ditch NASA. Let private explorers, modern Vikings inspired by the Norsemen's third desire, seek wealth on Mars. The basics of the expedition have  been worked out by Robert M. Zubrin, who has his own research and development company, Pioneer Astronautics, in Denver. Since devising the technology for a simple and cheap mission to Mars, Zubrin has been traveling the globe giving passionate lectures about "our generation's New World." He tells audiences of the prizes offered by 15th-century Portuguese and Spanish rulers to entrepreneurs for venturing down the African coast and across the Atlantic. (Columbus's expedition was financed not only by Queen Isabella but also by private merchants who stood to gain trading concessions.) Zubrin thinks that if  the United States Government were to offer a Mars Prize of $20 billion -- four times what he estimates a private mission would cost -- entrepreneurs would take the bait. If they made it to Mars and back, pocketing the prize, they could turn a nice profit; if they failed, taxpayers wouldn't be stuck with the bill.</p>

A manned mission to Mars, the fantasy that had paid the mortgage for generations of science-fiction writers, lost its appeal as soon as NASA plotted the itinerary. The $400 billion price tag seemed absurdly high to a nation bored with the sight of astronauts lumbering around craters. We already had enough extraterrestrial rocks, thank you.</p>
        <p>Recently, though, an intriguing modification to NASA's Mars plan has been suggested: ditch NASA. Let private explorers, modern Vikings inspired by the Norsemen's third desire, seek wealth on Mars. The basics of the expedition have  been worked out by Robert M. Zubrin, who has his own research and development company, Pioneer Astronautics, in Denver. Since devising the technology for a simple and cheap mission to Mars, Zubrin has been traveling the globe giving passionate lectures about "our generation's New World." He tells audiences of the prizes offered by 15th-century Portuguese and Spanish rulers to entrepreneurs for venturing down the African coast and across the Atlantic. (Columbus's expedition was financed not only by Queen Isabella but also by private merchants who stood to gain trading concessions.) Zubrin thinks that if  the United States Government were to offer a Mars Prize of $20 billion -- four times what he estimates a private mission would cost -- entrepreneurs would take the bait. If they made it to Mars and back, pocketing the prize, they could turn a nice profit; if they failed, taxpayers wouldn't be stuck with the bill.</p>
        <p>The Mars Prize would be a bargain for the public, and not merely because it would cost so much less than a NASA mission. It would also have the wonderful consequence of making exploration interesting again. Unlike NASA's conservative  officials, entrepreneurs couldn't afford to bore everyone with meticulously plotted test missions executed by bland technicians. They would have to take chances, risking their lives (or at least their employees' lives) with one bold  venture, as explorers used to do. And because they would finance their mission by selling media rights and marketing tie-ins, they would have to appeal to the  public's imagination. They couldn't go to Mars just to perform arcane scientific experiments and drop off a plaque with politicians' names. They would have to turn Mars, once again, into a dangerous and romantic destination.</p>
        <p>The journey would be a multimedia entertainment package put together by someone like Joel Rosenman, one of the promoters of the original Woodstock festival and its recent sequel. Rosenman, whose venture-capital projects have included an expedition to salvage doubloons from a sunken Spanish galleon in the Caribbean, has no trouble imagining the commercial possibilities of a journey to Mars.</p>
        <p>"Under NASA, space exploration has been a low-yield cash hog," Rosenman says. "To make a Mars mission profitable, you'd have to create a global consciousness. People have to be eating Mars cereal, listening to Mars music, entering Mars dance contests, watching Mars pay-per-view TV shows, driving cars with technology from the Mars mission. You'd want to put a celebrity in the crew -- Harrison Ford would be perfect -- or at least turn the crew into celebrities. I'd set up a betting parlor on the Internet where people could bet on everything from the temperature of the spaceship to which astronaut will be the first to catch a cold. Sprint would have Candice Bergen offering free phone calls when Mars was in a certain apposition to the Earth."</p>
        <p>The Olympic Games, a three-week media event, currently generates close to $2  billion from television and marketing deals; packaged properly, the three-year Mars extravaganza might make considerably more. "A Mars mission could attract the largest global audience ever," says David Hill, the president of Fox Sports. "The Olympics are just the Olympics -- people running, jumping, throwing balls.  Mars has figured prominently in man's imagination for thousands of years. It's the Red Planet, the God of War. Now it's the next logical step in human endeavor. The crew would be on live television traveling through space at 200 million miles an hour, and they could die at any moment -- it's the world's greatest soap opera."</p>
        <p>A commercial Mars mission may sound impractical and undignified, but that's only because our thinking has been warped by NASA, which is an anomaly in the annals of discovery: the wilderness has not usually been conquered by bureaucrats. The best models for a Mars mission are provided by the kind of explorers who early this century raced to the North and South Poles -- regions that seemed as remote, inhospitable and useless as Mars does today. Forget all those cautious mission planners speaking NASA jargon to emotionally repressed astronauts. We need explorers with flair, adventurers like . . . Amundsen and Shackleton.</p>
        <p>The Amundsen Approach</p>
        <p>ZUBRIN IS BORROWING HIS MARS strategy from the greatest of the polar explorers, Roald Amundsen, the first man to reach the South Pole and the first to sail the Northwest Passage. Before Amundsen started his trip through the Arctic ice in 1903, dozens of expeditions had unsuccessfully tried to traverse the Northwest Passage from the Atlantic to the Pacific. The British Navy, the NASA of the 19th century, kept sending armored ships with scores of sailors and  tons of salted meat, but the massive ships always ran aground or got blocked by  ice, and when the food ran out the men would give up.</p>
        <p>Norway, Amundsen's homeland, didn't have a grand navy; Amundsen had to pay for his own expedition. He spent his inheritance on a tiny old fishing boat and  hired a crew of six. "Amundsen's expedition was by far the smallest one ever to  attempt the Northwest Passage," Zubrin says. "He didn't go into the Arctic with  300 tons of salt pork. There wasn't enough room in his boat or his budget. As an expedition done with private money, it had to be, we might say, a pork-free mission." Amundsen was prepared to live off the land. When his ship got frozen in at the same spot where British sailors had perished, he and his men survived  by using local Inuit techniques. They built igloos, wore fur underwear and hunted caribou from dog sleds. Eating heartily, the men proceeded all the way through the Bering Strait.</p>
        <p>The Amundsen approach, as Zubrin calls his strategy for Mars, is nothing like the $400 billion Battlestar Galactica approach proposed by NASA engineers. NASA's ship, according to the 1989 plan, would have carried enough fuel for the  round trip and was so big that it would have had to have been assembled at a space station. Zubrin prefers an expedition that would travel light and live off the land -- or, more precisely, the atmosphere, which would supply the Martian equivalent of Amundsen's caribou: carbon dioxide. The expedition would bring machines for converting Mars's carbon dioxide into liquid oxygen and methane to  power the spaceship home. This local fuel would also power the utility vehicles used to drive around the Martian surface. Because the ship wouldn't have to lug so much fuel to Mars, it could be launched from Earth with rockets that have already been built and tested. Instead of NASA's 1,000-ton space liner, Zubrin proposes a pair of 120-ton ships; instead of a 30-year timetable,  he thinks he could get there in as few as 6.</p>
        <p>NASA was skeptical of the plan when it was drawn up six years ago by Zubrin and David Baker, both of whom were then engineers at Martin Marietta Astronautics. But once it became obvious that NASA's Mars scheme was unaffordable, the agency studied Zubrin's plan and provided $47,000 for him to build a prototype of the machine for converting carbon dioxide into rocket fuel. NASA's engineers, concluding that the Amundsen approach was technically feasible, drafted their own version of Zubrin's plan. NASA estimates that its mission would cost $55 billion -- a big improvement over $400 billion, but Zubrin thinks NASA could trim the budget to $30 billion by making do with less equipment and more spartan accommodations.</p>
        <p>Even greater economies, though, would come from bypassing NASA's bureaucracy, which is why Zubrin and others have been urging incentives for space entrepreneurs. (Last weekend, the privately financed X Prize Foundation announced a $10 million prize for the first manned, completely reusable spacecraft that can take off on its own, rocket 62 miles above Earth and safely  return to make another flight.) Zubrin figures that private explorers could get  to Mars cheaply by cobbling together off-the-shelf equipment (like Russia's low-priced booster rockets), renting a launch pad and subcontracting NASA to perform some tasks, like tracking the spacecraft. He estimates that the whole mission could be done for $5 billion.</p>
        <p>That's not much money by NASA standards -- the Apollo program cost 20 times as much -- but it's a daunting figure for private investors. To compete for the  Mars Prize, explorers will need creative financing. To pay for the Amundsen approach, they'll need to learn from Ernest Shackleton, a charismatic Anglo-Irishman who became the greatest polar salesman.</p>
        <p>The Shackleton Sell</p>
        <p>ON JUNE 11, 1909, AS HIS SHIP approached the Italian port of Brindisi, Shackleton was pacing the bridge and talking to himself. He was returning to Europe from a failed and nearly fatal expedition. Poor planning had forced him and his men to stop about 100 miles short of the South Pole. Stumbling into ice  crevasses, desperately sick and malnourished, the frostbitten men made it back to their ship by taking hourly doses of cocaine-laden "forced march" tablets.</p>
        <p>If Shackleton had worked for NASA, he would have faced the scrutiny of Congressional committees and journalists. NASA's officials would have been advising him to be quiet. But as it was, the self-employed Shackleton was eagerly preparing for the European press corps clustered on the dock, muttering  phrases in search of what he called the right "catchword."</p>
        <p>"I've got it at last!" he finally cried out. "Death lay ahead and food behind, so I had to return."</p>
        <p>A true pioneer: a man in 1909 searching for the right sound bite. Shackleton  couldn't afford to be unquotable: he paid for his expeditions by mortgaging profits from media ventures. Before leaving for Antarctica, he auctioned off the news and picture rights to London newspapers; upon returning, he dashed off a book that was immediately translated into nine languages. Shackleton turned his  expedition ship into a museum and charged admission. He sold special postage stamps with a cancellation mark from the Antarctic. He went on a 20,000-mile lecture tour, mesmerizing audiences with poetry and harrowing tales. Using the new media of his day, he made a phonograph record and showed the first movie of  the Antarctic. Other explorers had similar commercial instincts -- Peary designed a brand of Peary North Pole snowshoes and outerwear -- but no one could match Shackleton's verve.</p>
        <p>His hustling taught him a lesson that NASA hasn't yet learned: if you want to explore a place with no intrinsic value, you must create value. You need compelling characters and drama -- the kind of risk that NASA can no longer take. Manned missions have become tedious and prohibitively expensive because the agency's bureaucrats must take every possible precaution: one more accident  like the Challenger explosion would doom their careers, perhaps the whole space  program. A failed Government mission is always treated as a public scandal. When men died on a United States Army expedition to the Arctic in 1884, The New York  Times dubbed it "The Shame of the Nation" and demanded that America stop financing this "folly." The paper's crusade helped force the Government to cease Arctic explorations -- and then, two decades later, The Times itself proudly underwrote Peary's expedition.</p>
        <p>Folly somehow becomes acceptable if your own money is at stake. In fact, it can be an excellent career move. Shackleton's audacious misadventures in 1909 made him an international idol. His next expedition, when he was marooned in the Antarctic after ice crushed his ship, turned into an even more glorious failure  -- perhaps the most astonishing survival epic ever told (and, of course, sold). The worst trips make the best stories. Apollo 11 was a marvel of technical precision; "Apollo 13" grossed $337 million worldwide.</p>
        <p>Certainly no sane explorers would wish for disaster on the way to Mars. But whatever happens, they must have a Shackletonian knack for media exploitation. While Mars may be a more expensive goal than the Antarctic ever was, today's global markets offer much bigger returns to the explorer who can seductively package the trip.</p>
        <p>Mars: The Sales Pitch</p>
        <p>THE FIRST VOYAGERS TO MARS WOULD spend six months getting there, two years exploring its surface and six months coming home. In selecting the explorers, the natural temptation is to ask: Who has the best chance of pulling through the three-year ordeal? That's the wrong question. That's how NASA produced all those scintillating astronauts. The first question should be: Who has the best chance  of pulling the audience through the three-year ordeal?</p>
        <p>Fortunately, the market has already come up with answers, starting with the optimum size of the crew. The most successful television shows about isolated groups -- "Gilligan's Island," "Star Trek" and "Lost in Space" -- all enjoyed long runs with rosters of seven or eight people. Sending a family to another world offers classic sitcom opportunities, as demonstrated each week on the new  hit "Third Rock From the Sun," but the crew should also include unattached adults.</p>
        <p>The Mars expedition leader must ignore the advice of Michael Collins, a former astronaut and the author of "Mission to Mars," a 1990 book proposing a crew of married couples. "An element of stability, of old-shoe comfort, would be introduced by having one's husband or wife to fall back on," Collins argues. "Certainly a singles-bar atmosphere, a charged mixture of sexually unattached competitors, would be a disaster." A disaster for whom? Take a look at the ratings for "Friends."</p>
        <p>Each crew member needs the talents of an explorer -- physical stamina, emotional fortitude, technical resourcefulness -- and the charisma of a performer. Call it the Bright Stuff. To find the right candidates, and to generate publicity, the expedition leader can stage televised competitions around the world, testing candidates' physical, mental and telegenic skills: "American Gladiators" meets "Jeopardy" meets "Star Search." Finalists will spend a winter of competition in the Antarctic, the closest equivalent to the frozen plains and mountains of Mars. There, they'll hone their exploration and media skills while living in a model of the mobile home that will carry them through space and shelter them on Mars.</p>
        <p>"The habitation module's design is inspired by the Bumble Bee tuna can," Zubrin says. "It's a can 27 feet in diameter and 16 feet tall, divided into two  decks. The upper deck is laid out with rooms for the astronauts, a laboratory, an exercise area, a galley and a food-storage area that would double as a solar-flare storm shelter. The lower deck is more of a cargo hold, workshop area and garage for the rover that would explore Mars."</p>
        <p>Whether they're traveling through space or living on Mars, the explorers will always be in front of cameras feeding live images back to Earth, which would reassure the audience of the mission's integrity. Unlike some exploring "heroes" -- Peary and Byrd -- the Mars adventurers won't be able to come home with tales  of places they never reached. They'll have to make their money honestly. But at  least they'll have lots of opportunities for profit. A few possibilities:</p>
        <p>Corporate sponsorship. "Mars is a compelling platform for what we in the business call borrowed imagery," says Jay Coleman, the chief executive of the E.M.C.I. marketing company and an expert in special-event promotions. "If you're AT&amp;T, it's a great way to align your brand with high technology and the future. When you see companies like Coca-Cola spending $40 million just for the  right to say it's an Olympic sponsor, and then hundreds of millions more to buy  time to advertise that fact, you have to assume that they'd pay a lot to be associated with Mars."</p>
        <p>Marketing tie-ins. "I'd have a ball marketing the apparel, creating a whole new Mars look, selling the first sneaker to touch down on Mars," says Brandon Steiner, whose New York company is one of the leading sports marketers. "There'd be a collectibles market -- you could break a Mars rock into tiny pieces and mount each one inside a glass case. I'd love to see the spaceship going up with  a Nike logo on it. Of course, a model of the spaceship is going to be a great toy, and Mars would be happening for kids in cartoons. If you do everything right, you could net maybe a billion every year of the mission."</p>
        <p>Video games. Besides being lucrative -- their grosses exceed movie box-office sales -- video games create celebrities now that CD-ROM's feature real actors filmed on movie sets. The first Mars game, filmed during the explorers' training period, would come out well before the launch.</p>
        <p>"Millions of kids will pay to play the game and start to think of the astronauts as their friends," says Tom Zito, the president of Digital Pictures,  which has been filming members of the "Star Trek" and "Baywatch" casts for its popular science-fiction games. "Kids will be eager to follow the real mission when it starts on television -- especially if one of the astronauts looks like Cindy Crawford. Then you use video clips from the mission itself to make more games. The ultimate cool thing would be to put a robot with a camera on Mars, so you could send it commands and go out exploring the planet yourself, searching for treasures hidden by the astronauts. At the end of the game, you'd find a statue of Elvis."</p>
        <p>Name that peak. Shackleton sensibly affixed the names of his patrons to the geography of the Antarctic. For about $34,000, William Beardmore got his name on a 100-mile-long glacier. What would Rupert Murdoch pay to put his on Mars's 2,800-mile-long canyon? How much for an 18-mile-high volcano named Mount Gates?</p>
        <p>Mars on line. Technophiles pay to watch a Martian sunset, join the explorers  in chat rooms or track the data streaming back to Earth, like the readings from  the machinery converting carbon dioxide into methane. If the converter is running properly, the explorers should have enough rocket fuel to get home; if not . . . well, let's take a look at the crew members' pulse rates.</p>
        <p>Mars TV. "The networks won't want to pay for access to the mission," says Av  Westin, the producer who developed "Close-Up" and "20/20" at ABC. "But once cable pays and the public gets interested, they'll find a way. They'll probably  save the purity of the news divisions by getting their entertainment divisions to put up the money. You want the astronauts doing a weekly news update show --  you know, 'Live from Mars, it's Saturday Night.' Then you want occasional documentaries. You need to produce a sense of drama, the way Geraldo did when he opened the Capone vault on live television, although you'd like it to turn out better than that. You could do a live show with a payoff at the end. You start out asking: 'Is there water underground on Mars? Are there fossils down there? Tonight we'll drill below the surface strata. . . .' "</p>
        <p>The most popular television program, though, might be an extraterrestrial version of "The Real World," MTV's weekly documentary chronicling the personal lives of a bunch of young narcissists sharing a living space. To a casual observer, the footage of roommate squabbles seems dreadfully tedious, but it's one of the highest rated programs on MTV, a testament to the strange allure of real-life soap operas.</p>
        <p>"The mission gives you a $5 billion set for a drama," says Rosenman, the venture capitalist. "You might even think about giving the explorers scripts, although with the right crew, the reality might be more compelling. We could become riveted to this thing developing between Florence and Greg when she was supposed to be sweet on Homer -- a timeless story of a love triangle, or of someone whose conscience is being tested for elasticity. Once you have a devoted band of addicts, everyone will start to care if Greg and Florence and Homer make it to Mars and back."</p>
        <p>The uncertainty of the mission will complicate financing, of course, since investors will be leery of a project that could end at any moment. But if investors take the truly coldblooded, long-term view, they'll realize that even  an utter failure -- the loss of all eight explorers on the way to Mars -- wouldn't necessarily mean financial ruin. Like the failed expeditions to the poles, a Mars disaster would fascinate the public, sell books and movies and inspire sequels. New competitors would be tempted by Mars's deadly glamour. Billionaires bored with mountain-climbing expeditions and America's Cup yachts could race one another to Mars. But to succeed commercially, Rosenman says, a Mars mission must at least seem to be grander than a sporting event.</p>
        <p>"You can't trivialize this massive effort to reach another planet," he explains. "The ancillaries fizzle if the audience thinks you're doing it just for the heck of it. You need a larger reason to get there -- a Hollywood twist like the Mars mission as the only way to divert an Earthbound asteroid, or chemicals in the Martian soil believed to cure cancer. As with my salvage operation in the Caribbean, the entrepreneur has to ask: What is the motivation? What is the Martian equivalent of those Spanish doubloons?"</p>
        <p>That's a difficult question. Mars, at first glance, seems to have nothing of  value. But Zubrin is ready with an answer. His plan comes complete with doubloons.</p>
        <p>Our Favorite Martians</p>
        <p>ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS PASSAGES IN science fiction is the conclusion of Ray  Bradbury's "Martian Chronicles," published in 1950. It describes a family that has fled a holocaust on Earth. Their spaceship reaches Mars, uninhabited because its civilization of gentle extraterrestrials was wiped out by previous human invaders. The family lands and emerges from the spaceship next to a canal:</p>
        <p>"I've always wanted to see a Martian," said Michael. "Where are they, Dad? You promised."</p>
        <p>"There they are," said Dad, and he shifted Michael on his shoulder and pointed straight down.</p>
        <p>The Martians were there. Timothy began to shiver.</p>
        <p>The Martians were there -- in the canal -- reflected in the water. Timothy and Michael and Robert and Mom and Dad.</p>
        <p>The Martians stared back up at them for a long, long silent time from the rippling water.</p>
        <p>The dream of colonizing Mars, so popular for so long, today seems as quaintly anachronistic as the canals that previous generations of astronomers thought they saw on its surface. But Zubrin, as usual, has a new plan. He and Chris McKay, a planetary scientist at NASA's Ames Research Center, propose to release  chlorofluorocarbons into the Martian atmosphere. They figure that CFC's could jump-start a runaway greenhouse effect, warming the planet, melting its polar caps and thickening the atmosphere with carbon dioxide released from ice and soil. Humans could then walk around the surface without pressurized suits, and as trees and plants produced oxygen the atmosphere would eventually become breathable.</p>
        <p>"Relative to the technology we have today, Mars is no more hostile to us than America was to Europeans in the 1600's," Zubrin says. "Granted, the transportation costs are higher -- back then a middle-class person could pay for the passage by liquidating his assets. But the costs will come down quickly once somebody makes the first trip. If a developer could persuade a research station  to sign up as an anchor tenant, he could start a small settlement with its own greenhouse and build from there."</p>
        <p>To advance his theory, Zubrin likes to quote Frederick Jackson Turner's classic essay on the American frontier. "To the frontier the American intellect  owes its striking characteristics," Turner wrote in 1893, arguing that the "stubborn American environment" nurtured creativity because it offered "a gate of escape from the bondage of the past."</p>
        <p>Zubrin sees only one new frontier capable of providing that escape again. "Mars is far enough away to free its colonists from intellectual, legal or cultural domination by the old world," he says. "It's rich enough in resources -- water, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, metals -- to give birth to a new world. Having a planet of refuge could be of enormous social use. It would reinvigorate civilization on Earth with its new ideas, just as America reinvigorated Europe.  In human history, free dynamic societies have existed only during the four centuries of frontier expansion in the West. Without a new frontier, our civilization is doomed to stagnation."</p>
        <p>Mars as the new America, Mars as the only hope of civilization: here are some serious doubloons. Here is sufficient motivation to ennoble any Mars mission. And if the Mars-as-America analogy later turns out to be wrong -- if a Mars colony isn't practical during the next few centuries -- the mission will have served a fine purpose anyway. Posterity will enjoy a new exploration saga, probably more stirring than the Vikings', maybe even as good as Shackleton's.</p>
        <p>The Antarctic's recent history, in fact, may be the best guide to Mars's future. Although it failed to become a hot spot of colonization after being charted by the polar explorers, Antarctica has nonetheless been a boon to humanity. Government scientists, taking advantage of the risky trailblazing done by private explorers, have set up research stations that have yielded vital data for today's environmental debates. And another group of people has followed the  explorers. Arriving in cruise ships during the Antarctic summer, clad in identical bright red parkas, these visitors clamber on the white cliffs and take pictures of one another posing with penguins.  Mainly wealthy and elderly, they  fatten up on buffet dinners along the shores explored by Shackleton. In his direst moments, stumbling in the snow and popping cocaine tablets, Shackleton probably never imagined that he was risking his life to make a continent safe for geriatric tourists.</p>
        <p>If the destiny of Mars, too, is to be an adventure-travel package, an exotic  segment of the entertainment industry, then the first humans to land will experience something quite like the famous moment in "The Martian Chronicles." When the explorers disembark in front of a television camera and address the audience back home, they won't have to imagine what future Martians will be like. They'll see the Martians staring back from the monitor of their own camera: local guides showing foreign customers the sights, standing next to an interplanetary tour bus as they pursue the Vikings' third and most enduring desire.</p>
