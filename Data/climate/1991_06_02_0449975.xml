        <p>With BRAIN CHILD (Morrow, $20), a gripping, disturbing exploration of what it means to be human, the Australian George Turner joins a handful of writers -- names like Stanislaw Lem and J. G. Ballard spring to mind -- whose works transcend national and genre boundaries and deserve to be known by readers who would not ordinarily pick up a book labeled science fiction.</p>
        <p>Mr. Turner's 1988 novel "Drowning Towers" was a grim yet paradoxically heartening vision of survival in a world threatened by global warming. The theme of "Brain Child" is simply stated: Frankenstein brought up to date. In the first decade of the 21st century, scientists tinkering with the human genome create three groups of mutant clones whose mental abilities are demonstrably superior to those of normal Homo sapiens; in fact, no one knows exactly what their limits are.</p>
        <p>When the most advanced group of clones, known as Group C, commits collective suicide, the so-called Nursery Project is aborted, its very existence hushed up. The other clones seem content to pursue their incomprehensible interests away from public scrutiny, until one of them contacts his illegitimate son, David Chance (conceived during an uncharacteristic adolescent indiscretion), and persuades him to undertake a curious errand. According to persistent rumor, just before they ended their lives the Group C children had discovered the secret of immortality, which they left behind in coded form; unless David can get to it first, this dangerous information may fall into the hands of powerful and unscrupulous forces.</p>
        <p>Peering over David's shoulder as he noses into the history of the Nursery Project, we become privy to the slowly unfolding truth about the mutant children. Mr. Turner's rock-solid prose provides the sure footing needed to follow the investigation through all its twists and turns. David himself, an ever-surprising double agent named Jonesey and a malign bureaucrat named Armstrong are not only perfect foils for the mutants but also strong, believable characters whose conflicting desires drive the narrative toward a brilliantly staged conclusion that is both emotionally and intellectually satisfying.</p>
        <p>Wisely, Mr. Turner never gets too explicit about the mental processes of his unlovable supermen and superwomen. What comes across most clearly is their suffering, which is as irremediable as that of Dr. Frankenstein's original monster. It is through their doomed attempts to understand the world into which they have been so rudely thrust that we come to appreciate their alienness -- and our own.</p>
        <p>Back before mass-market paperback books, the short story was where the action was in science fiction. Heinlein, Asimov, Bradbury, Clarke -- all made their mark with stories that took off from a single clear premise with a minimum of narrative baggage and boosted the breathless reader into uncharted territory.</p>
        <p>FULL SPECTRUM 3 (Doubleday, Cloth, $20; Paper, $12.95), the third in a series of anthologies edited by Lou Aronica, Amy Stout and Betsy Mitchell, contains 23 previously unpublished stories by authors ranging from the little-known to the world-famous. Mr. Aronica declares in a brief introduction that the editors had no theme or thesis to guide their selections; their only goal was to "represent excellence" in contemporary science fiction and fantasy.</p>
        <p>My reaction to the book as a whole was mild disappointment. For all their stylistic variety, there are too many (I counted at least 10) stories that read like parables, designed to drive home some accepted moral truth. To be truly memorable, a parable must explore the unfamiliar ramifications of a society's moral code; it is difficult to build a good story out of earnest reminders to preserve the environment or cooperate with the neighbors. But not impossible: David Zindell's "When the Rose Is Dead" succeeds with a meta fiction about a monstrous crime, a terrible expiation and the healing power of storytelling itself. The entire story is constructed to give multilayered meaning to Rose's poignant cry: "Don't take away the painful memories, Doctor, they're all I have."</p>
        <p>"Newton's Sleep" by Ursula K. Le Guin also deals imaginatively with guilt and loss. Having escaped a hell on earth, the inhabitants of an antiseptic space environment are compelled to re-create the messiness of their old lives in order to feel alive at all. In "Fondest of Memories" Kevin J. Anderson squeezes an astringent moral from our tendency to edit the past to suit our predilections. In "Matter's End" Gregory Benford draws on quantum theory to fashion a fresh cautionary tale about our relation to the universe we call home.</p>
        <p>"Snow on Sugar Mountain" by Elizabeth Hand strikes just the right note of unwearied wonder when a young runaway with a shape-changing amulet meets an aging astronaut still bitter over the fact that he never set foot on the moon. "Black Glass" by Karen Joy Fowler is a funny feminist romp with a nicely observed male protagonist, a Federal narcotics agent who falls afoul of Haitian vodun and accidentally calls up a gargantuan reincarnation of the tavern-busting Carry Nation. The dead also come to life in "Loitering at Death's Door," translated from the German of Wolfgang Jeschke by Sally Schiller and Anne Calveley, in which science is called upon to satisfy an all-too-human desire that is better left unsatisfied.</p>
        <p>In "Rokuro," Poul Anderson cleverly adapts the form of a traditional Noh play to address the question of whether an artificial intelligence can have a soul; less successful is his effort to blend archaic diction -- "Please, misunderstand me not" -- with modern techspeak -- "So he built a scanner that copied his consciousness into a program that he then put into his computer."</p>
        <p>Other contributors whose ambitions at least suggest a direct line of descent from the Golden Age of the science fiction short story are Michael Bishop, Barry N. Malzberg, Ted Chiang, Marcos Donnelly, and Mark L. Van Name and Pat Murphy.</p>
        <p>In A REASONABLE WORLD (Tor/Tom Doherty, $17.95), Damon Knight, the prolific critic, editor and author who published his first science fiction story in 1941 at the age of 19, has written a discursive utopian novel that does not ask to be taken too seriously. Storywise, it completes the trilogy begun with "CV," in which a telepathic entity of presumably extraterrestrial origin, dredged accidentally from the ocean floor, established a symbiotic relationship with thousands of human beings. Once in place, the symbiont refused to let its hosts commit any violent or destructive acts. How the world changes as this "infection" spreads is the burden of a reasonable world.</p>
        <p>Discursive utopias (unlike the more single-minded tracts such as Sir Thomas More's original and Edward Bellamy's "Looking Backward: 2000-1887") run the risk of seeming to be no more than a list of the author's likes and dislikes. As if to thumb his nose at this risk, Mr. Knight offers lists of milestones culled from a history of the 21st century: "a new class of antinarcotic neurotransmitters, introduced into food and water in the remaining large cities," wipes out drug abuse; the invention of "a totally effective contraceptive method for both men and women" is followed by the emergence of "sexual intercourse as a performance art form," and so on.</p>
        <p>A little of this goes a long way. More intriguing are Mr. Knight's efforts to grapple with the moral predicament that confronts his nonviolent symbionts: is a little violence today justifiable to prevent a lot more violence tomorrow? In the end, however -- and this is a fate shared by utopianists of every sort -- the only readers who will remain enchanted with Mr. Knight's book from beginning to end are those who share his likes and dislikes down to the last quirk and crotchet.</p>
