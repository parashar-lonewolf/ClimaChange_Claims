        <p>Nearly 370,000 Cambodian refugees in border camps in Thailand are preparing to return home on United Nations buses.

        <p>La Paz Journal: At a federal courthouse, women arrive with swollen eyes and bruises to seek the modest protection of the state.  A4  ZAIRIANS BLAME U.S.</p>

        <p>Foreign Minister David Levy, brooding about his faction's decline within Israel's governing party, said he was stepping down. Even if he stays in the party, he has left it divided before an election campaign.  A6</p>
        <p>Israelis assail Germany's leader for welcoming Kurt Waldheim.  A6  THE EAST GERMAN VISE</p>
        <p>A dissident of the former East Germany will lead an investigation of its 40-year Communist dictatorship and how it held on to power.  A7  FEELING TRAPPED IN PALERMO</p>
        <p>Italy holds national elections next month, but few in Sicily expect fundamental change to reach easily into the Mafia's heartland.  A7  Another humiliating election day for France's governing Socialists.  A7  National A8-15  WELFARE PLAN'S SMALL CHANGE</p>
        <p>A 1988 law to improve the nation's welfare system has not achieved the major change that its supporters hoped for, a report found.  A1  BIG FEARS FOR BANKS</p>

        <p>Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado, a Democrat who has been mentioned as a Vice Presidential candidate, has found political success "by absolutely telling it straight," even if it annoys the President.  A8  THAWING OF A COLD WARRIOR</p>
        <p>William Colby, the former spymaster who was branded a war criminal on antiwar posters, has emerged as a leading advocate of deep military budget cuts and an adviser to Eastern European intelligence services trying to adjust to democracy.  A10  A WAY OF LIFE FELLED</p>
