        <p>IT was meant to be simple -- messy to administer, perhaps, but simple to sell to Congress. But now President Clinton's proposed levy on energy is in political trouble, and for reasons that apparently have a lot to do with the Administration's haste to raise maximum revenue with minimum political pain.</p>
        <p>The President may yet be able to build a winning political coalition for the levy. But tinkering will not save Mr. Clinton from the interest group collision he hoped to avoid.</p>
        <p>The reasoning behind the proposal, pieced together by analysts sympathetic to the Administration, went something like this:</p>
        <p>Tens of billions of dollars would be needed to meet the President's budget goals, and there were limits to how much more could, or should, be squeezed from income taxes. Energy, by contrast, would make a fecund cash cow. And since overall consumption would not change much in response to modest price increases, producers would not squawk because they would be able to pass the tax through to users the way retailers pass on general sales taxes.</p>
        <p>Besides, there would be brownie points to score with environmentalists, who never met a tax on fossil fuels they did not like. An energy levy might even take some wind out of Ross Perot's sails, since he favored a stiff gasoline tax.</p>
        <p>The most neutral energy tax is one on the heat content of fuels -- a B.T.U. tax. But the tax really need not be neutral, the reasoning went, because coal and oil do more environmental damage per B.T.U emitted. The surcharge on coal did not survive: Coal was already scheduled to take a hit under the Clear Air Act of 1990, and coal-state Democrats served notice they would not sit still for another. But the surcharge on oil did, doubling the proposed tax per barrel. All told, the Administration estimated, the typical family would pay a mere $300 a year more to save the future from the debt sins of the fathers.</p>
        <p>So what went wrong? Technical glitches, such as a loophole that would have given foreign oil refiners a cost advantage over domestic competitors, were easily plugged. And a few interest group objections, including the prohibition on listing the tax as a separate line on utility bills, were easily accommodated. But there was no comparable repair for the Administration's misconception that the tax would be spread so thin that no one would bother to make a Federal case of it.</p>
        <p>Actually, gasoline does fit the Administration's model. Since the price of gasoline per B.T.U. is very high, the tax amounts to just 7 percent of the cost at the pump. And since there are no ready substitutes, consumers would no doubt hunker down and pay.</p>
        <p>But the heavy heating oil used in industrial boilers is a different story. The price per B.T.U. is relatively low, so the tax amounts to a quarter of the current price. And unlike gasoline, heavy heating oil competes in the marketplace directly with natural gas and coal.</p>
        <p>Indeed, notes Philip Verleger of the Institute for International Economics, many utilities routinely switch from fuel to fuel to save their customers a few pennies a month. And since the B.T.U. tax would add just 5 percent to the price of natural gas, heating oil producers would have to eat most of the cost to stay in the game. "It's a tax on heavy oil from California, Mexico and Venezuela," said Mr. Verleger -- one that ironically "works to the advantage of light oil producers including Libya and Algeria."</p>
        <p>Or consider farmers, whose fuel-hungry machines make it possible for a single family to cultivate thousands of acres of grain. They could not pass through the extra tax to buyers because grain prices are set by world markets. Nor could long-haul truck drivers, who must compete for freight with far more energy-efficient railroads. Thus, even if the President muscles the bill through the House, he will face determined special interests in the more hostile Senate.</p>
        <p>The easiest way out, says Larry Goldstein of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, would be to drop the surcharge on oil, perhaps recapturing the revenue with a higher rate on all fuels. That would disarm the interests most at risk from the tax on oil products.</p>
        <p>A better way, Mr. Goldstein argues, would be to recognize the B.T.U. tax for what it is: a flawed method for raising a lot of money in a hurry. He would pass an energy levy now, with the proviso that within two years it be folded into a broad-based tax on consumption -- something on the order of a national sales tax or value-added tax.</p>
        <p>Such a tax is probably in the works anyway, he notes, since the Administration will have to find $50 billion to $100 billion a year as a reliable source of revenue to cover the cost of national health insurance. The politics of the switch, of adding a percentage point or two to the consumption tax in order to jettison the B.T.U. tax would, at worst, be a wash.</p>
