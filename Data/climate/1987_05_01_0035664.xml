        <p>LEAD: A conference on protection of the earth's protective ozone layer has reached an agreement in principle to freeze and ultimately to reduce production and consumption of chemicals thought to deplete the ozone.</p>
        <p>A conference on protection of the earth's protective ozone layer has reached an agreement in principle to freeze and ultimately to reduce production and consumption of chemicals thought to deplete the ozone.</p>
        <p>Dr. Mostafa K. Tolba, the executive director of the United Nations Environment Program, which is sponsoring the 31-nation meeting, announced the progress today. He said it marked a substantial step toward ''a meaningful international agreement to protect the ozone layer.''</p>
        <p>Such an agreement could be concluded by September after further consultations, he said. A 1978 Ban on Aerosol Use</p>
        <p>The stratospheric ozone layer that protects life from harmful ultraviolent radiation has been endangered, according to many scientists, by chlorofluorocarbons and other industrial chemicals that interact destructively with it, causing depletion of the layer. Chlorofluorocarbons are used as solvents, propellants in aerosols, refrigerants, in plastic foams and in fire extinguishers.</p>
        <p>The United States and Canada banned the use of chlorofluorocarbons in aerosols in 1978, but they are still widely used for other applications.</p>
        <p>Dr. Tolba said delegates had agreed to back a freeze at 1986 levels of production beginning in 1990 and to follow with a 20 percent reduction in production and consumption of the chemicals within one to two years after that.</p>
        <p>The draft agreement also includes two options for a further 30 percent reduction, to be agreed upon later. Compliance With Agreement</p>
        <p>When asked about enforcement, Dr. Tolba indicated that nations that signed the agreement would be expected to adopt legislation or regulations voluntarily putting it into effect.</p>
        <p>But he and other delegates said several questions remained unresolved. They included the ultimate amount of the reduction in production of chlorofluorocarbons, as well as the precise substances that would be covered by a protocol to the 1985 Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer and the timetable for putting the reductions into effect.</p>
        <p>''There was no dissent at all about the fact that we are facing a real problem of depletion of the ozone,'' Dr. Tolba said. ''But because of economic factors, industry needs to have lead time to adjust to changes.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Tolba said he was confident such a protocol could be appended to the Vienna convention during a subsequent meeting of the scientific experts in Brussels in June and a diplomatic conference on the issue scheduled in September in Montreal. Coverage of Accord Widened</p>
        <p>He noted that the delegates had agreed to broad coverage of several types of chlorofluorocarbons to prevent users from switching from one type to another. He added that they ultimately expected to discuss halons, similar chemicals that are used less but have greater ability to deplete the ozone layer.</p>
        <p>''We want no loopholes in a treaty,'' Dr. Tolba said. Environmentalists observing the conference hailed the move as a breakthrough. Dr. Tolba also drew praise from the environmentalists for committing his agency to calling a special conference if scientific studies scheduled for later this year found that a hole the size of the continental United States in the ozone layer above Antarctica had significantly widened.</p>
        <p>A key element in the meeting this week was a shift in strategy by European nations, notably Britain and other members of the European Community, away from a longer timetable for the freeze and reduction.</p>
        <p>The European nations endorsed the tighter schedule proposed by Dr. Tolba and the United States, and they are to consider the additional 30 percent reduction at a meeting in May. U.S. Softened Position</p>
        <p>The United States had proposed a near-term freeze at 1986 levels to be followed by a reduction of chlorofluorocarbons of nearly 95 percent, but it appears to have softened that position.</p>
        <p>Although the American representative, Richard Elliot Benedick, refused to comment, delegates quoted United States officials as telling the conference the United States welcomed the compromise proposal but needed to consult with Washington before accepting it.</p>
        <p>Some delegates said a 50 percent reduction in chlorofluorocarbon production could in effect begin a retreat from the use of the chemicals in industrialized countries, since they would become less profitable to produce.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists say an agreement to begin reducing chlorofluorocarbon production and use in the industralized world will not only reduce the chlorine content of the atmosphere but also continue to spur development of substitutes.</p>
