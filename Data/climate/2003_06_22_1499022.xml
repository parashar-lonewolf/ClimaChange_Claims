        <p>WHEN environmentalists unveiled a plan to lower auto emissions in New Jersey last year, they thought it would zip through the state Legislature.

        <p>The plan has taken a strange path. For instance, the measure has faced opposition from some Democrats who are normally protective of the environment, yet it has found support from Republicans who are often more sympathetic to the interests of business.

        <p>WHEN environmentalists unveiled a plan to lower auto emissions in New Jersey last year, they thought it would zip through the state Legislature. Instead, some quick maneuvering by opponents has forced them to push the proposal through the State House like a gas guzzler running on empty.</p>
        <p>The plan has taken a strange path. For instance, the measure has faced opposition from some Democrats who are normally protective of the environment, yet it has found support from Republicans who are often more sympathetic to the interests of business. And although a majority in the Senate and the Assembly has signed on in supporter of the measure, it has nonetheless had trouble moving out of committee.</p>
        <p>A primary opponent of the measure, state Senator Joseph Suliga, the Democratic cochairman of the Environment Committee, made it clear during the winter that he had no intention of releasing the bill. Yet Mr. Suliga, whose district in Linden embraces a large General Motors plant, insists that he is not trying to stop the bill, even though he will not let it out of his committee. And the governor, who supported the notion of strict emissions standards during his election campaign, says he has been too busy fighting for his budget to enter the argument.</p>
        <p>''Everything that has happened has been a cynical ploy to appease us but not let the bill pass,'' said Jeff Tittel, director of the New Jersey chapter of the Sierra Club. ''It has really been lobbyists for the auto industry and a couple of key legislators holding this up.''</p>
        <p>The environmentalists' proposal comes as the state is trying to decide on the level of pollutants that new cars will be allowed to spew into the atmosphere. On average, New Jersey has some of the dirtiest air in the country, violating federal health standards for more than 20 carcinogens. Under federal law, every state has to pick one of two plans -- the federal rules established by the Environmental Protection Agency, or somewhat stricter standards adopted by the state of California.</p>
        <p>For their part, environmentalists in New Jersey are pushing legislators to adopt the California plan, which would go into effect in 2006, while opponents, primarily business groups, have urged the state to rely on the federal rules, which would start in 2004.</p>
        <p>California's program, which was imposed in 1968, predated the creation of federal standards by two years. Four other states --New York, Massachusetts, Vermont and Maine -- have adopted the California regulations, according to Jerry Martin, spokesman for the California Air Resources Board.</p>
        <p>To Dena Mottola, executive director of the New Jersey Public Interest Research Group, the choice is a simple one. ''New Jersey has the second-worst air toxins problem in the country,'' Mr. Mottola said. ''In terms of smog, we are third worst. The biggest risk to our health and to the environment is in the air.''</p>
        <p>Business groups who have opposed the plan, including auto makers and the New Jersey Business and Industry Association, contend that there is only a small difference in results between the California plan and the federal plan. But they say that the California plan forces additional costs on car makers and auto dealers.</p>
        <p>''This is a bad bill because it does not provide any realistic improvement to the environment,'' said Jim Sinclair, first vice president of the New Jersey Business and Industry Association. ''This is more about raising funds and politics than it is about helping or improving the environment.''</p>
        <p>While both sides agree that California's standards are stricter as far as the amount of toxins leaving the tailpipe, they disagree over the effect on the environment. Business groups cite studies conducted for auto manufacturers, as well as an opinion from the Environmental Protection Agency that says there is a minimal difference between the California plan and the one put forward by the environmental agency.</p>
        <p>''The E.P.A. agrees that there is virtually no benefit,'' said Gregory Dana, vice president for environmental affairs at the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers. ''We are not opposed to cleaning up New Jersey's air, but we think it is going to happen a lot easier than they think it is going to happen.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Martin said that while it was hard to measure the effect of California's program, he said cities like Los Angeles had seen improvements in air quality over the past 20 years as measured by high pollution days, known as first-stage alerts.</p>
        <p>''Los Angeles, which has the dirtiest air in North America, in the late 1980's had first-stage alerts 120 to 150 times a year,'' Mr. Martin said. ''Now, they rarely have one a year.''</p>
        <p>Other environmentalists also said that analyses by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and by a consortium of regulators in Northeastern states found substantially greater benefits with the California plan.</p>
        <p>''New Jersey will benefit from adopting the California motor vehicle standards not just in the near term but over the long term as well,'' Coralie Cooper, transportation program manager for a consortium of northeastern environmental regulators, testified at a Senate committee hearing this year.</p>
        <p>Ms. Cooper testified that by the year 2020, the California program would result in a 25 percent greater reduction of airborne toxic chemicals than the federal program and a 3 percent greater reduction in carbon dioxide. While she said the federal standards have tightened in recent years, she noted that ''the California program still offers cleaner cars than the federal program.''</p>
        <p>Up until now, both sides have also invested substantial political effort in winning the fight. Lobbyists for business groups have worked the halls of the State House, and industry experts have flown in to speak with legislators. Environmental groups have flexed their considerable political muscles as well, not only in the State House but through door-to-door campaigns. For example, a recent flyer put out by a coalition of some of the state's largest environmental organizations said, ''This bill has become the defining moment on the environment for the legislature this term."</p>
        <p>The bill to adopt the more stringent California standards was first introduced in June 2001, said State Senator Thomas H. Kean Jr., a Republican, who was one of its original sponsors. As it moved through the legislature it picked up support, and by January of this year the bill had the clear backing of a majority of both houses.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Ms. Mottola of the New Jersey Public Interest Research Group said that 50 of the 80 members of the General Assembly had signed on as co-sponsors, along with 27 of the 40 state senators.</p>
        <p>''We could pass the bill tomorrow if they would post it,'' she said last week.</p>
        <p>Getting the bill onto the floor for a vote has been the problem. Except in unusual cases, bills must first pass through a legislative committee before they can be posted for a vote in either house. And moving the emissions bill through those committees has been difficult.</p>
        <p>State Senator Suliga said he planned to hold the bill in his committee until the end of the year because he believed legislators needed more time to study California's program.</p>
        <p>In a recent interview, Mr. Suliga cited the federal environmental agency's report, and questioned whether the California standards would provide any appreciable benefit for air quality. Like other legislators, he also expressed some reluctance to surrender New Jersey's regulatory power to decisions made by the California legislature. Under federal law, if New Jersey adopts the California standard, it also accepts any changes that California makes in the future.</p>
        <p>''If California changes, the regulation changes,'' Mr. Suliga said. ''It is not a great policy when you are at the whim of another state.''</p>
        <p>After Mr. Suliga blocked the proposal, supporters of the bill, including John Bennett, the Senate's Republican co-president, rewrote the measure and sent it through the Transportation Committee in May. The senators on that panel approved the bill, but added another twist; they attached a spending provision to provide extra cash to enforce the new standards. At that point opponents cried foul, since the spending rider forced the bill into the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee, which was already jammed with bills dealing with state finance.</p>
        <p>''It was just a maneuver to provide another barrier,'' Ms. Mottola said.</p>
        <p>The General Assembly followed a similar pattern.</p>
        <p>The measure passed through the Environment Committee, but Speaker Albio Sires, a Democrat, referred it to the Appropriations Committee. Joseph Donnelly, a spokesman for Mr. Sires, said questions arose about the bill's financial effect.</p>
        <p>Yet Ms. Motolla says the nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services issued a report that concluded the bill would have no financial effect on state government. But Mr. Donnelly -- who said the report was issued after the referral -- said legislators also wanted to find out whether it would increase costs associated with government vehicles.</p>
        <p>''We wanted to examine what financial impact, if any, the bill might have on state, county and local governments,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Some observers have attributed the delays to legislators who do not want to cross the state's powerful environmental groups during an election year. Scot Mackey, a lobbyist representing the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, said, ''I think there is a concern that the environmental community is out there, pushing this bill and saying, 'This is great for our environment.'''</p>
        <p>One of the people who has disappointed supporters of the bill so far is Governor McGreevey, who signed on as an early supporter of the California plan. Still, supporters of the measure have complained that the governor has done little to fight for the measure.</p>
        <p>''If the governor truly supported this initiative, I think things would have been freed up enough for it to pass,'' Senator Kean said.</p>
        <p>But Micah Rasmussen, the governor's spokesman, said Mr. McGreevey supported the bill, he has had other issues to fight for this session.</p>
        <p>''We are pushing our smart growth agenda, the budget, car insurance,'' Mr. Rasmussen said. ''We have had other fights to fight.''</p>
        <p>Still, he said the governor would sign the California emissions plan if the Legislature approved it.</p>
        <p>''Clearly, it is something he would like to sign,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Whether the bill will even get that far is uncertain. Last week, supporters were struggling to push the measure out of committees in both the Senate and General Assembly. If successful, they will still face a floor vote in both houses before the end of the session, now scheduled for June 30.</p>
        <p>''We are very confident,'' David Pringle, campaign director of the New Jersey Environmental Federation, said last week. ''There has always been consistent, overwhelming support for this bill.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Pringle said if the committees released the bill, a vote would come quickly.</p>
        <p>''The toughest part is bringing the bill up for a vote,'' he said. ''The easy part is winning.''</p>
