The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.2 percent -- its biggest one-day gain in almost three years. The other major benchmarks also rose 2 percent or more. [Pages A1 and C1.]</p>
        <p>QUESTIONS ON APPLE OPTIONS Apple Computer said that it had uncovered irregularities related to stock options awarded from 1997 to 2001, raising questions about whether a large grant made to the chief executive, Steven P. Jobs, was properly disclosed. [C1.]</p>

        <p>ANTI-EMISSIONs EXPERIMENT An experiment by Royal Dutch Shell in the Netherlands to limit emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas blamed for climate change, illustrates a fundamental shift in the oil industry that offers glimmers of hope for the future. [C1.]</p>
        <p>U.S. AUTOMAKERS TRY NEW TACK Detroit auto companies, which have lagged behind their Japanese rivals in selling hybrid vehicles, are taking a new environmental direction, by focusing on flexible-fuel vehicles, which can run on gasoline and another type of fuel like ethanol. [C1.]</p>

Experts say the rapidly graying city is leading one of the greatest demographic changes in history, one with profound implications for all of China. [A1.]</p>
        <p>CERVICAL CANCER VACCINE A federal advisory panel voted unanimously to recommend that all girls and women ages 11 to 26 receive a new vaccine, made by Merck, that prevents most cases of cervical cancer. [A12.]</p>
        <p>SHIFT IN KPMG CASE Defendants in the government's mammoth tax-shelter case against 16 former employees of the accounting firm KPMG are quietly embracing separate defense strategies, a shift that could reshape the case. [C3.]</p>

        <p>TENET SETTLEMENT Tenet Healthcare has reached a $900 million settlement with federal officials to end investigations into accusations of overbilling of Medicare.

The company also plans to sell about a dozen hospitals to regain its financial footing. [C3.]</p>
