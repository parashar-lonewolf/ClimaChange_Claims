        <p>Dr. Jeffrey W. Runge was not what one might have expected as the Bush administration's top auto safety regulator.</p>
        <p>If officials in the administration are often stereotyped as siding with corporate interests, Dr. Runge did not fit the mold.</p>
        <p>In January 2003, he angered auto executives in Detroit by saying that he would not let his child drive a vehicle that received no more than two stars in government rollover ratings even if it were the last one ''on earth.''</p>
        <p>Auto executives considered the comment an attack on the rollover proclivity of sport utility vehicles. Though Dr. Runge eventually dialed down his tone, he got his way, and automakers have started to change their S.U.V. designs.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, the Transportation Department said he would step down after four years as head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Dr. Runge, who was not available for comment Friday, will become the first chief medical officer at the Department of Homeland Security.</p>
        <p>For many in the auto industry, Dr. Runge, who treated many car-crash victims as an emergency room doctor in Charlotte, N.C., will be remembered for his push to make vehicles safer. But environmental groups have generally been dismayed at his performance in the other aspect of his job, regulating fuel economy.</p>
        <p>He is the latest in a line of administrators, Republican and Democrat, who have not been able to curb the nation's oil use.</p>
        <p>On the safety front, he cajoled automakers into agreeing to work jointly to make sport utilities less dangerous to passenger cars. He has set in motion modifications to side-impact crash tests that would essentially require automakers to start equipping vehicles with side airbags that protect people's heads. He also spent considerable effort focusing on driver behavior and increasing use of one of the oldest and most effective safety devices, the seat belt.</p>
        <p>''He alerted people to the dangers of S.U.V.'s,'' said Joan Claybrook, the president of the consumer group Public Citizen who led the safety agency under President Jimmy Carter. ''He tried to listen to both the public interest, consumer groups and industry.''</p>
        <p>Not that she always agreed with him. Ms. Claybrook is backing language in a highway funding bill before Congress that would lay out timetables for several new highway safety regulations, including standards to make vehicle roofs sturdier.</p>
        <p>Dr. Runge has objected to ''inflexible mandates.''</p>
        <p>Eron Shosteck, a spokesman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, said ''as a physician, he's a man of science, so he was able to bring to his position an awareness of the need to base policy on sound science.''</p>
        <p>At the same time, officials of some environmental groups are upset that even a war in the Middle East has not led to significant toughening of fuel-economy regulations.</p>
        <p>''Basically, I think he did half a job,'' said Daniel Becker, the Sierra Club's top global warming strategist. ''Runge sure didn't cut our reliance on the Persian Gulf.''</p>
        <p>While he did preside over a modest increase in fuel-economy regulations for S.U.V.'s and other light-duty trucks, the average fuel economy of new vehicles continues to stagnate. New cars and trucks today consume more gas, on average, than they did nearly two decades ago.</p>
        <p>The agency's most ambitious project remains undone, the first overhaul of fuel-economy regulations for light-duty trucks.</p>
        <p>Though Dr. Runge will remain through August, when the specifics of the administration's new fuel- economy plan are expected to materialize, his successor will have much work left to do in carrying through a final rule. Whether the new plan improves fuel efficiency will depend on the details.</p>
        <p>But the primary interest of Dr. Runge, 49, has been saving lives, not gasoline. He spent two decades practicing emergency-room medicine, and in an interview in 2002, he recalled an accident that took place just two months before he came to Washington.</p>
        <p>A teenager on the way to school was brought to the emergency room after her Mazda 626 was struck by a Ford Explorer. Dr. Runge did not treat the teenager, who died, but remembered seeing her friends waiting for news of her condition.</p>
        <p>He recalled the accident as a textbook case of the flaws in S.U.V. design that allow the vehicles to pose dangers to cars because of their ground clearance. In accidents, the front ends of S.U.V.'s often do not engage with the sturdiest parts of cars they hit.</p>
        <p>''This was a clear case of override, where the S.U.V. rode over the hood of the car and killed her instantly,'' Dr. Runge said. The case, he said, ''crystallized why I was here.''</p>
