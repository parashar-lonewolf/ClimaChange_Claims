        <p>8 P.M. (Turner Classic Movies) FOR LOVE OF IVY -- (1968). When a Long Island family's maid (Abbey Lincoln) wants to go back to school, their hippie son (Beau Bridges) decides a fix-up is in order, and his father (Carroll O'Connor) is there to guarantee that it happens. Sidney Poitier (above, with Ms. Lincoln) stars in this, Hollywood's first real attempt at portraying grown-up love between a black man and woman, and the follow-up to another first, ''Guess Who's Coming to Dinner,'' shown on TCM at 6. The Mamas and the Papas swing on the soundtrack.</p>
        <p>7:30 P.M. (BET) ACCESS GRANTED -- Watch 'em here first. Tonight's show takes its cameras behind the scenes of the new video for T. I.'s ''Live in the Sky,'' featuring Jamie Foxx, and, at 8, Snoop Dogg's ''Vato,'' with Pharrell Williams and B Real of Cypress Hill.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (13) JEWELS FROM THE PARIS OPERA BALLET -- The muse behind George Balanchine's ''Jewels,'' the story goes, was not some ethereal ballerina but rather the gems in the cases at the New York jewelers Van Cleef &amp; Arpels. In this ''Great Performances'' presentation, the Paris Opera Ballet lushly interprets this plotless three-act work created for New York City Ballet in 1967, and gives it a French couture twist, with costumes and backdrops designed by Christian Lacroix.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (Fox) BONES -- Dr. Temperance Brennan (Emily Deschanel), television's prettiest crypt keeper, begins a new season of rummaging through fishy-smelling remains, starting with a train wreck that includes the bodies of a senator and a high-profile businessman. Meanwhile, there's tension back in the lab, where her new boss, Dr. Camille Saroyan (Tamara Taylor, above right), seems to have eyes for the object of Brennan's affections, Agent Seeley Booth (David Boreanaz). Ouch.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (Fox) JUSTICE -- Jerry Bruckheimer, the executive producer of CBS's ''C.S.I.'' and ''Without a Trace,'' tries out his Midas touch on this new legal drama about a Los Angeles dream team with an aptitude for forensics. Victor Garber plays the firm's slick-as-an-oil spill public persona; Rebecca Mader is the brilliant clinician whose radar is set to search and destroy.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (ABC) LAST DAYS OF EARTH -- Scare tactics? In this new ''20/20,'' scientists like Stephen Hawking explain seven of the deadliest threats to our existence: black holes, artificial intelligence, supervolcanoes, asteroid strikes, nuclear war, disease and climate change.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (FX) 30 DAYS -- Er, make that 23 days. In this season finale of his reality show, Morgan Spurlock (left), who bulked up on -- and nearly blacked out from -- McDonald's food in his 2004 film ''Super Size Me,'' tries to stomach a month of serving time in a</p>
        <p>Richmond, Va., county jail.</p>
