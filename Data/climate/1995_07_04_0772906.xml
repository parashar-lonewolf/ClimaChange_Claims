        <p>NO one has yet shown how life originated on Earth, and the chance that science will ever unlock all the details of the process seems vanishingly small. But as molecular biologists discover how nature may have built unaided the maze of tiny bridges that led from inanimate chemicals to living creatures, hopes brighten that the ancient pathway to life may one day be at least dimly revealed.</p>
        <p>The latest news about the quest comes from Dr. Stanley L. Miller of the University of California at San Diego, a pioneer in the reconstruction of "prebiotic" chemical reactions -- the primeval chemistry of the young Earth that is presumed to have given rise to life. Dr. Miller and a colleague, Dr. Michael P. Robertson, report in a pair of papers that they have found a way that nature could have created several vital building blocks that had seemed beyond the reach of prebiotic chemistry.</p>
        <p>The achievement, they believe, strengthens the theory that the first living creatures were able to synthesize protein and reproduce without the help of the DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) that makes up the genes of advanced organisms, including human beings. Instead, scientists theorize, primitive viruses and one-celled organisms may have depended solely on RNA (ribonucleic acid) to guide and catalyze their growth and reproduction. According to this theory, which has been gradually accepted during the last 20 years by most biologists, the early "RNA world" evolved into the present system, in which both RNA and DNA play important roles in life processes.</p>
        <p>Speculation that the primitive earth was an RNA world arose in 1982, when Dr. Thomas Cech of the University of Colorado disclosed the discovery (for which he was later awarded a Nobel prize) that RNA molecules alone, without the help of outside enzymes, could induce themselves to split up and splice themselves together in new arrangements. This meant that primitive forms of life (like the single-celled tetrahymena animals with which Dr. Cech experimented) could have come into being without any need by nature to invent complex protein enzymes.</p>
        <p>Since a landmark experiment Dr. Miller performed in 1953 with the late Dr. Harold C. Urey, the discoverer of deuterium, Dr. Miller has devoted his life to the quest for life's origins. In the Miller-Urey experiment, a sealed flask was filled with a mixture of methane, ammonia, carbon dioxide, hydrogen and water vapor -- all substances presumed to have been rich in the Earth's early atmosphere. Through this mixture an artificial lightning bolt was passed for several weeks, at the end of which a brownish sludge that formed in the flask was found to contain amino acids of the kind necessary to build proteins. Since then, experimenting with different mixtures of simple gases and conditions, Dr. Miller has created 13 of the 20 amino acids essential to life.</p>
        <p>But one problem the theory has had to confront was a possible shortage in the primeval oceans of two key pieces in the structure of an RNA molecule, known as cytosine and uracil. Dr. Miller and Dr. Robertson believe they have solved the difficulty.</p>
        <p>In companion pieces in the journals Science and Nature , the two scientists report that both substances might have been produced by the lifeless young oceans in ample quantities by a process involving the evaporation of sea water in tropical lagoons, the freezing of sea water in polar regions and the mixing of their products in the open ocean.</p>
        <p>The freezing part of the process could have increased sea water concentrations of hydrogen cyanide, Dr. Miller believes. Cyanide is a deadly poison to animals, but it was an essential precursor to many of the molecules from which primitive life arose.</p>
        <p>The evaporative part of the process, Dr. Miller said, could have concentrated the traces of urea that accumulate in sea water as a result of reactions in the atmosphere caused by lightning flashes. In experiments, Dr. Miller and Dr. Robertson showed that when the concentration of the simple chemical urea in sea water is high enough, it reacts with another quite common component of sea water that also owes its formation partly to lightning bolts. Under these conditions, the scientists found, the reaction between urea and the second chemical, known as cyanoacetaldehyde, yields fairly large amounts of cytosine, which is one of the nucleotide bases (or "letters") the DNA and RNA molecules use to spell out the genetic "words" controlling protein production and the growth and reproduction of organisms.</p>
        <p>A bonus of this discovery is that cytosine, which is itself an essential component of both DNA and RNA, reacts in the presence of water to form uracil, one of the four essential "letters" in RNA. (Uracil is not an ingredient of DNA, which utilizes another nucleotide base, thymine, in its place). Relatively large amounts of two other essential bases in the four-letter alphabets of DNA and RNA, adenine and guanine, are believed to have formed in ample amounts from the polymerization of naturally occurring ammonium cyanide in a slightly alkaline solution.</p>
        <p>Because of the new experiments, it now appears plausible that all four RNA nucleotide bases could have been created in nature by ordinary atmospheric, oceanic and geological processes from simple, naturally occurring ingredients.</p>
        <p>In another series of experiments, Dr. Miller and Dr. Robertson have carried the discovery a step further.</p>
        <p>One of the many chemicals that lightning bolts are believed to have created as they ripped through the early Earth's atmosphere is formaldehyde, which presumably rained into the primeval oceans. When uracil reacts with formaldehyde it forms an important intermediary substance known as hydroxymethyluracil, which in turn can react with a large variety of chemicals that biologists assume to have been present in the primeval oceans. The results, Dr. Miller and Dr. Robertson report, are molecules that incorporate "side chains," molecular branches connected to chains of atoms, that are also found in most of the 20 amino acids used by organisms to make proteins.</p>
        <p>This coincidence implies, the scientists said, that the catalytic activity of RNA -- its ability to promote the synthesis of many different kinds of protein -- may have been much greater in the infant Earth than had been assumed. The RNA world may therefore have been much richer in variety than scientists had supposed.</p>
        <p>But a daunting array of problems still blocks understanding of the origin of life. One of these concerns the origin of the molecular backbone of RNA -- a current concern of Dr. Miller's.</p>
        <p>The backbones of RNA and DNA are both sugar phosphates containing five-sided rings of carbon atoms, but there is a slight difference between them. In the case of DNA, double strands of pentose sugar are wrapped helically around each other and connected by pairs of nucleotide bases. The backbone of RNA, however, is a single strand of ribose phosphate -- a pentose sugar containing an additional oxygen atom. To this backbone are attached the four nucleotide bases.</p>
        <p>The problem in imagining how RNA got started, Dr. Miller said, is that ribose is unstable, particularly when it is warm.</p>
        <p>Dr. Miller said he is preparing a new paper describing experiments that show that half of any quantity of ribose decays in a little over an hour at the boiling point of water. Even at the freezing point, the half life of ribose is only 44 years. This, he said, implies that high-temperature settings, including a primitive earth heated by the impact of an asteroid, seem less plausible as cradles of life, if it is assumed that early life came about in an RNA world -- one in which the creation and survival of the ribose-phosphate backbone was crucial.</p>
        <p>Some scientists, including Dr. Francis Crick, co-discoverer of the double-helical structure of DNA, have suggested that life had too little time to originate on the primitive earth, given only a "prebiotic soup" of simple chemicals. They have proposed that life might have reached the earth in the form of spores sent out from some distant planet.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Miller and most other molecular biologists regard this idea, called "panspermia," as begging the question; the origin of life on that hypothetical distant planet still must be explained somehow.</p>
        <p>Dr. Christian de Duve, a Belgian microbiologist awarded the 1974 Nobel prize for his investigation of the structures of cells, dismisses the panspermia notion as unnecessary.</p>
        <p>"If you equate the probability of the birth of a bacterial cell to that of the chance assembly of its component atoms," Dr. de Duve wrote in his textbook, "A Guided Tour of the Living Cell," "even eternity will not suffice to produce one for you. So you might as well accept, as do most scientists, that the process was completed in no more than one billion years and that it took place entirely on the surface of our planet."</p>
        <p>The hard part, he wrote, was getting from the simplest chemicals to the first specialized cells, after which "it took no more than 150,000 generations for an ape to develop into the inventor of calculus."</p>
        <p>As to whether some guiding hand was needed for the process, Dr. de Duve commented:</p>
        <p>"The answer of modern molecular biology to this much-debated question is categorical: chance, and chance alone, did it all, from primeval soup to man, with only natural selection to sift its effects. This affirmation now rests on overwhelming factual evidence."</p>
        <p>But the succession of chances that created life did not operate in a vacuum, he said. "It operated in a universe governed by orderly laws and made of matter endowed with specific properties. These laws and properties are the constraints that shape evolutionary roulette and restrict the numbers that can turn up. Among these numbers are life and all its wonders, including the conscious mind."</p>
