        <p>CONSIDER the strawberry.</p>
        <p>It is the most perfect of fruits: alluringly red, subtly perfumed, shaped like a heart, sweet as a smile. It is an emblem of summer, the most fulfilling of seasons. The English essayist William Butler got it right 400 years ago when he wrote, ''Doubtless God could have made a better berry, but doubtless God never did.''</p>
        <p>It is also the most frustrating of fruits: difficult to grow, vulnerable to disease, costly to harvest, dauntingly perishable. Until the development of railroads in the middle of the 19th century, strawberries had to be eaten where grown, as soon as they were picked. Their fleeting season was a season of celebration.</p>
        <p>Hence the strawberry socials that flourished long ago in small town America, often in churchyards picturesquely decked with Japanese lanterns. Hence Zola's Nana, a city girl, ecstatic at her first sight of strawberry fields, squatting in the mud and plucking the ripe, juicy fruit as the rain pelted down.</p>
        <p>Escoffier thought strawberries a sufficiently royal delicacy to name a dessert he invented -- strawberries macerated in orange juice and curacao, served in a crystal bowl with creme chantilly -- after the Russian royal family, the Romanovs. In England, brimming bowls of strawberries during the Wimbledon tennis matches still epitomize the summer social season.</p>
        <p>But today winter strawberries are taken for granted by consumers in New York and Philadelphia and Chicago, who have no idea how much ingenuity, technique and labor have been lavished on the project of growing them out of season and getting them to market.</p>
        <p>They are never quite as satisfying as the ones snatched from the garden in June and drenched in cream, any more than trucked-in sweet corn ever quite matches the succulence of home-grown. But they are more than reasonable facsimiles, and miraculous, if you think about them, sitting perkily there on the market shelf while arctic air swirls outside.</p>
        <p>Almost all the strawberries consumed in the eastern half of the country during the winter come from farms within a 50-mile radius of Plant City, a little Florida town with lots of strawberry-red signs, just east of the urban sprawl of Tampa. This is the Winter Strawberry Capital of the World, the local chamber of commerce says, and it seems never to have occurred to anyone to challenge the claim.</p>
        <p>Why here? The local soil is sandy, which is good, but other places have sandy soil. More important, Plant City is about as far north (and therefore as close to the winter-bound urban markets) as practical, given the berries' susceptibility to frost damage. It also got an early start, in the 1880's, when Henry B. Plant brought the railroad across the peninsula from Jacksonville to Tampa, with a stop here. Many modern growers are great-grandsons of the strawberry pioneers, who named their town for the railroad man.</p>
        <p>Nowadays, the berries travel by refrigerated truck. Picked by hand at 8 in the morning, deposited by the picker directly into a pint basket sitting with 11 others on a cardboard flat, that flat sitting with 111 others on a pallet, a ripe strawberry goes straight from the field to a broker's chiller, a boxcar-size room that takes the fruit down to about 36 degrees, and from there directly into a refrigerated truck. By 2 P.M., the truck will be out on Interstate 4, headed north, and 48 hours after that, with any luck, the berry will be on sale in a supermarket somewhere in the snow belt.</p>
        <p>By then -- and here is the problem, for all the hybridization and advances in cultivation and transport methods in recent years -- the berry will already be halfway through its useful life, even if harvested at the optimum moment and handled with care.</p>
        <p>Strawberries cannot be picked green, like bananas, and ripened artificially; they must be picked when they are fully ripe, and they remain at peak flavor for only four or five days after that. If they are mishandled -- if, for example, they are washed or their green caps are removed too soon, and not just before they are eaten -- they will deteriorate much sooner.</p>
        <p>The berries' shelf life can be increased slightly by wrapping whole pallet loads in stout plastic bags and replacing the air inside with carbon dioxide, which retards spoilage. But that increases the price.</p>
        <p>Other things being equal, strawberries picked toward the end of the season tend to be sweeter. Other things being equal, those that have ripened during moderate weather tend to be sweeter than those that have been subjected to too much heat or too much cold. But other things are not always equal, as Erin Best of the Florida Strawberry Growers Association readily concedes.</p>
        <p>''Once they get to the retailer, who knows how long they sit in the warehouse?'' she asked. ''Are they kept in coolers until they go on sale? Are they displayed in refrigerated cases or not? All that matters.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Best's tips: choose berries with bright green caps; brownish caps mean old fruit. Look for uniformity of size and color; if the bottom layer differs from the top, that's a sign that the picker is cutting corners. And if you are not going to eat the berries almost as soon as you get them home, spread them out on a cookie sheet and put them into the refrigerator that way.</p>
        <p>T HIS is a high-investment, hard-labor, drive-you-crazy business,'' said Billy Simmons, 46, a fourth-generation strawberry farmer, who tried office work but gave up the security of a paycheck for the precarious pleasures of tilling the soil.</p>
        <p>Each year, he said, brings some new trial.  A couple of years ago, the growers spent weeks watching temperature gauges and listening for alarms each night, talking nervously with their neighbors on a radio-telephone network, ready to spray their fields with water to coat the strawberry plants with protective shields of ice.</p>
        <p>Last year, there was no frost. But 10 days of rain left many berries unappetizingly soggy. This year, robins are the enemy.</p>
        <p>Yes, lovable old robin redbreasts, in their thousands. As Mr. Simmons stood alongside one of his fields, explaining cultivation methods to me, his son Shad, 18, raced from one corner of the property to another, hopping out of his truck to fire his 12-gauge shotgun into the air and scatter the birds. But no matter what he or others in the nearby fields fired, whether blanks that banged impressively or shells that whistled noisily, the robins flew just a few yards before alighting on another tempting row.</p>
        <p>''Sounds like World War III,'' Mr. Simmons said. ''I've got two guys blasting away, 12 hours a day, for all the good it does.  It's the worst case of robins in 10 years, 500-600 in one field. You have to laugh.''</p>
        <p>He didn't.</p>
        <p>Why not cover the plants with nets? asked the visiting weekend gardener. Money, Mr. Simmons answered; covering a few rows of strawberries in a family plot is simple, but protecting Plant City's crop would take 253 million square feet of netting.</p>
        <p>COMICALLY primitive as the gunfire may seem, it holds the losses down. But it is the only thing primitive about growing strawberries in winter, which is in all other respects a prime example of modern, capital-intensive, technology-assisted agriculture.</p>
        <p>The plants are grown in raised beds -- long hillocks of mounded earth, two feet wide, formed and compacted by a shaping device towed through the fields by a tractor. The shaper is then unhooked and another device hitched up. It buries plastic tubing in the hillocks and covers the rows with black plastic sheeting. The tubing carries water and fertilizer directly to the plants' roots; the sheeting retains heat and moisture and inhibits the growth of weeds.</p>
        <p>When planting time comes in October, the plants are set by hand, mostly by Hispanic workers, some of them migrants, through holes punched in the plastic. Most of the plants come from Nova Scotia or Quebec. Summers are cooler there, Mr. Simmons explained, which means the tender seedlings are less subject to ''bugs and blights.'' The last season he used Florida-grown plants, he said, he lost almost two-thirds of them to one disease or another.</p>
        <p>That was no insignificant loss. Hybrid strawberry plants cost $80 a thousand, and an acre holds about 20,000 plants. Since Mr. Simmons farms more than 30 acres, about average for the 150 growers in the area, he spends about $50,000 every fall on seedlings. It takes 100 million plants to fill the fields  around Plant City, which produce close to 20 percent of the nation's strawberries.</p>
        <p>The first fruit appears on the plants after roughly 35 days, and it keeps coming, so the berries must be picked manually and individually, like grapes for a beerenauslese wine. At any given moment, a plant contains tiny, immature, white berries, half-grown green berries and big, mature red berries, so glossy they look almost as if they had been coated with enamel. The pickers work the same row 30 to 50 times before the season ends in April or May, when the weather gets too hot (and California strawberries flood the market).</p>
        <p>VIRGINIA strawberries grow wild in the Eastern United States; the cooking writer Edna Lewis mentions picking them along streams and fence rows in her Virginia childhood. For two centuries, they were the world's favorite. Then in 1712, a French engineer brought another species, the Chilean strawberry, back from a voyage to South America; his name, incredibly enough, was Frezier, pronounced like ''fraisier,'' which means ''strawberry plant.'' A cross of the two New World varieties on the Plougastel peninsula in Brittany produced the garden strawberry now cultivated everywhere, in a wide number of hybridized varieties.</p>
        <p>Two-thirds of Mr. Simmons's strawberries are Sweet Charlies, and a third are Camarosas. Camarosas are California-bred, but Sweet Charlies are Florida natives, developed at the nation's only research lab devoted to strawberries, the Research and Education Station of the University of Florida, located near Dover, just a few miles down the road from the Simmons properties.</p>
        <p>Every year, scientists there produce 100 to 150 experimental genetic crosses. Seeds taken from them are germinated, and 10,000 to 15,000 plants are set out in trial beds each year. The scientists consider themselves lucky if 1 in 10,000 shows promise.</p>
        <p>''This center has released two varieties in 10 years,'' said David D. Dunigan, a plant virologist on the Dover staff. ''We have a couple now that we're keeping a close watch on. This is no work for people in a rush.''</p>
        <p>Strawberry hybridization is a kind of balancing act. Obviously, bad-tasting strawberries won't sell, so those are eliminated. The goal is a juicy sweetness, balanced by a slight undertone of acid, in a berry that is soft, with no hint of woodiness, but still firm enough ''to make it to Montreal in the back of a semi,'' in Dr. Dunigan's words.</p>
        <p>Looks and size do not affect taste, but they affect sales. Everyone knows that perfectly symmetrical scarlet jumbos can taste like polystyrene. The very best strawberries I ever tasted came from the village of Dalat, in the mountains of Vietnam -- phenomenally sweet little things, bursting with juice, the essence of strawberrydom. They were also mottled and misshaped, just the kind of thing American consumers scorn.</p>
        <p>In addition to flavor, glamour and road-worthiness, Dr. Dunigan and his colleagues look for good plant architecture. If the berries develop underneath the leaves, they are hard to pick efficiently, so the scientists choose varieties whose berries stand apart from the foliage.</p>
        <p>Yet another attribute the breeders seek is disease resistance, which is one of the reasons they are so partial to Sweet Charlie, which was named for the late Dr. Charles Howard, the hybridizer who came up with it. Sweet Charlie is naturally resistant to Colletotrichum acutatum, a highly dangerous fungus that attacks strawberry plants.</p>
        <p>No variety is perfect, of course. And even the best varieties require the most finicky kind of care throughout the growing season.</p>
        <p>''You have to be out there in the fields with them every single day,'' Dr. Dunigan said. ''It's nothing like planting corn and  hanging around, waiting for the harvest.  Growing winter strawberries is the most technical and the most intensely managed system of agriculture that I know of.''</p>
        <p>Which is to be expected, I suppose, when the result is another out-of-season treat for the pampered shoppers of 20th-century America.</p>
        <p>STRAWBERRY SOUR CREAM SHORTCAKE</p>
        <p>Time: 1 hour</p>
        <p>2  cups sifted all-purpose flour</p>
        <p>3  teaspoons baking powder</p>
        <p>1/4  cup sugar, plus additional for sweetening berries and sour cream</p>
        <p>3/4  teaspoon salt</p>
        <p>3  ounce package cream cheese</p>
        <p>2  tablespoons chilled butter</p>
        <p>1  large egg</p>
        <p>About 1/2 cup milk</p>
        <p>1  tablespoon butter, melted</p>
        <p>1  quart fresh strawberries, hulled and thinly sliced</p>
        <p>1  cup sour cream.</p>
        <p>1. Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Into a large mixing bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, 1/4 cup of the sugar, and the salt.  Add the cream cheese and 2 tablespoons chilled butter. Using a pastry blender or two knives, cut the cream cheese and butter into the mixture until it resembles coarse cornmeal.</p>
        <p>2. Break the egg into a measuring cup, and beat lightly with a fork. Add enough milk to make 3/4 cup. Pour the egg mixture into the flour mixture, and stir. Knead the dough inside the bowl just until it is blended and cohesive, about 20 seconds.</p>
        <p>3. Shape half of the dough into a flattened ball, and place in a greased 8 round cake pan. Pat the dough flat to the edges of the pan. Brush the top of the dough with the melted butter. Shape the remaining dough into a flattened ball, and place in the pan on the buttered dough, patting flat to the edges.  Bake until golden brown, about 17 to 20 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool.</p>
        <p>4. Place the sliced strawberries in a mixing bowl, add sugar to taste, and mix well. Place the sour cream in a small bowl, and add sugar to taste, mixing to blend well. To serve, remove the cake from the pan, and use a knife to help pry the layers apart; they should split naturally where the dough had been buttered. Place the bottom layer on a serving plate, and top with sweetened strawberries. Place the second layer over the strawberries, and top with sweetened sour cream. Serve immediately.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 servings.</p>
        <p>STRAWBERRY POTS DE CREME  Adapted from ''Roast Chicken and Other Stories''  by Simon Hopkinson (Ebury House, 1996)  Time: 1 hour 15 minutes, plus 6 hours' chilling</p>
        <p>8  ounces strawberries (7 or 8 large berries), hulled</p>
        <p>3  tablespoons superfine sugar</p>
        <p>4  large egg yolks</p>
        <p>1 1/2  cups heavy cream</p>
        <p>1 1/2  tablespoons Cointreau.</p>
        <p>1. Preheat oven to 275 degrees. In the container of a blender, combine strawberries, sugar and egg yolks. Process until pureed.</p>
        <p>2. Bring a kettle of water to a boil. Pass  strawberry mixture through a fine sieve into a bowl. Add 1 cup cream and Cointreau. Mix well. Divide mixture evenly among four 1-cup ramekins. Place ramekins in a baking dish, and add enough boiling water to come halfway up the sides of ramekins.</p>
        <p>3. Place baking dish in the oven, and bake until the custard is just set, about 1 hour. Remove from the oven; place ramekins on a rack, and cool. Cover with foil or plastic wrap, and refrigerate at least 6 hours. To serve, pour 1 or 2 tablespoons of cream on top of each custard, so that each time a spoonful is eaten, cream fills the hole.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
