        <p>A Chevron television advertisement broadcast in Russia whimsically pokes fun at Europe's efforts to diversify its sources of energy away from fossil fuels.</p>
        <p>A breeze picks up on the streets of Paris, scattering leaves and newspapers and blowing a man's bowler hat down a boulevard in a mighty gust. A voice-over explains: ''As a source of energy wind power alone cannot do it all. Just to power a city like Paris would need 20,000 wind turbines.'' The camera pans up to show the Eiffel Tower converted into a huge lumbering windmill.</p>
        <p>Chevron ran the advertisement on NTV television, a station owned by Gazprom, from March 24 until April 17, according to TNS Gallop AdFact, an ad tracking agency in Moscow. Statoil of Norway also ran ads on NTV.</p>
        <p>It just so happens that Chevron and Statoil are two of several companies seeking business with Gazprom, the Russian natural gas monopoly. Analysts and company officials say that foreign companies are so eager to do business with Gazprom that they are trying to win favor or at least notice by running advertisements on Gazprom-owned media in Russia.</p>
        <p>Chevron and ConocoPhillips of the United States, Statoil and Hydro of Norway and Total of France are now in talks with Gazprom to join a consortium to develop the Shtokman offshore gas deposit estimated to hold 3.7 trillion cubic meters. All of the companies except Conoco have run ads in Russia during the negotiations, according to TNS Gallop.</p>
        <p>Though they have limited retail business here, the companies have run at least 33 television spots and 86 print advertisements in Moscow from January 2005 until this April, roughly the period of negotiations for the project, according to Gallop.</p>
        <p>Chevron said its ad was shown earlier in other countries and broadcast as part of a worldwide campaign to encourage debate about energy issues. A Chevron spokesman in London, Michael R. Barrett, said the timing of the placement in Russia was coincidental and not intended to raise Chevron's visibility during the Shtokman talks.</p>
        <p>Paul A. Floren, a spokesman for Total, said in a telephone interview that any advertising in Russia was part of a worldwide campaign unrelated to Shtokman.</p>
        <p>''Gazprom is on an expansionist drive and they've been snubbed in Europe,'' said Ivan N. Mazalov, an energy analyst at Prosperity Capital Management in Moscow. ''This is why Gazprom wants to get some PR services.''</p>
        <p>The Statoil spots on NTV profile the company's new Snoehvit platform in the North Sea off Norway, a structure with technologies similar to those needed to develop the Russian deposit, according to Statoil.</p>
        <p>Kai Nielsen, a spokesman for Statoil, said that his company often ran advertising timed to enhance its image during negotiations or large energy conferences and that this was common practice in the industry.</p>
        <p>''It's quite normal,'' he said. ''We've seen it in other countries. Even though we are famous in Norway, we have to realize that we are not famous all over the world.''</p>
        <p>The intended audience, he said, ''is not the man in the street'' because Statoil has limited retail business in Russia. ''It's the decision makers and the people around them we target.''</p>
        <p>Asked why Statoil chose NTV for its advertising, Mr. Nielsen said an external publicity agency in London advised his company to place ads on that channel.</p>
        <p>Simon Blakey, a Paris-based analyst of European natural gas markets for Cambridge Energy Research Associates, said talks on the 40-year $20 billion development would not hinge on questions of image. Dividing risk and capital costs are crucial in negotiating such big energy deals, he said.</p>
        <p>Gazprom this year budgeted $124 million for public relations. But, as the Chevron ad suggests, Western energy companies are also helping by speaking well of a potential partner and rich source of reserves in an era of ever tighter global supply.</p>
        <p>Just last month, the German energy companies BASF and E.On both publicly supported Gazprom's expansion plans in Europe. E.On's chief executive called criticism of the Russians ''completely exaggerated and overblown.''</p>
        <p>While Mr. Mazalov at Prosperity Capital said it was unlikely there was an expressed quid pro quo for the good press, a number of energy companies that do business with Gazprom or hope to do so have become vocal in Gazprom's support recently.</p>
        <p>BASF on April 27 obtained just under 25 percent in a big Siberian gas field in an asset swap with Gazprom while E.On is now negotiating for a similar share.</p>
        <p>Hydro and Statoil ran advertisements profiling the companies' technical prowess in offshore drilling, reflecting these companies' expected roles in the Shtokman consortium. To highlight its expertise in underwater engineering, Hydro ran a print ad showing the open surface of the ocean with text that said, ''the next oil and gas platform in Russia may look like this,'' or entirely submerged.</p>
        <p>Lars Bjelvin, a spokesman, said the ads were intended to reinforce Hydro's position in the talks by highlighting what the company does well.</p>
        <p>An official with a German company working closely with Gazprom executives said the ads were noticed. He did not want his name used because of his company's business with Gazprom.</p>
        <p>''Will it get Chevron brownie points? Will it get them closer to a role in Shtokman? I don't know,'' the official said. ''At least it won't hurt.''</p>
