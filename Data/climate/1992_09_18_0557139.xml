        <p>Experiments in Switzerland on a simulated rain forest suggest that the rising carbon dioxide content of the earth's atmosphere may eventually be even more damaging to plant life and crops than many scientists had believed.</p>
        <p>In a report being published today by the journal Science, Dr. Christian Korner and Dr. John A. Arnone 3d of the University of Basel, Switzerland, say that although carbon dioxide is essential to the growth of plants, their experiments suggest that excessive amounts of it may actually impair plant health.</p>
        <p>In less than 100 years, Dr. Arnone said in an interview, the world's atmosphere may be so heavily laced with carbon dioxide that the photosynthesis by which plants create and store their fuel could be impaired, possibly reducing some food crops. Worries About Warming</p>
        <p>Environmentalists are already worried about rising carbon dioxide levels for another reason: its role in the so-called greenhouse warming effect. Many scientists believe that an excess of carbon dioxide, partly the result of such human activities as burning fossil fuels, will produce widespread changes in climate. Some projections suggest that the United States might one day have a hot, arid climate like that of present-day northern Mexico, and that crop production in this country would fall catastrophically.</p>
        <p>Some scientists who challenge this view contend that a richer content of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere might offset the negative effects of a warmer, drier climate by providing more carbon as nourishment for plants. It might be, they say, that crops able to utilize the extra carbon dioxide could continue to yield good harvests.</p>
        <p>But the new results by Dr. Korner, an Austrian, and Dr. Arnone, an American, appear to throw cold water on this supposition.</p>
        <p>In photosynthesis, energy from sunlight is absorbed by green chlorophyll in plant cells called chloroplasts. Chemical reactions in the cells convert carbon dioxide and water into sugar and other carbohydrates used by plants as building materials. Using Identical Ecologies</p>
        <p>For their experiments, Dr. Korner and Dr. Arnone built identical sets of greenhouses and recreated complete rain-forest ecologies in each, including 15 species planted in typical rain forest soil and maintained at appropriate temperatures and humidity levels. The placement of individual plants was carefully replicated in each test greenhouse.</p>
        <p>In one set of greenhouses, the carbon dioxide content of the air was maintained at 340 parts per million, a level very close to that in the earth's present atmosphere. In the other set of greenhouses, the carbon dioxide content was increased to 610 parts per million, a level the earth's atmosphere will reach well within the next century, if carbon dioxide continues to increase at its present rate.</p>
        <p>Both sets of plants grew vigorously, Dr. Arnone said, but the high-carbon-dioxide group produced no more weight of vegetation than the other group. Moreover, plants exposed to high carbon dioxide formed "massive" amounts of starch grains in their uppermost leaves, he said.</p>
        <p>"Starch can slow photosynthesis," Dr. Arnone said. "If starch grains accumulate in the chloroplasts, it disrupts their function. Just how toxic this may be to plants we do not know, but if leaves build up too much starch they behave abnormally."</p>
        <p>The scientists also found that increased doses of carbon dioxide produced increases in the fine-root structure of plants, leading to a doubling of the amount of carbon dioxide given off by the soil in which they grew. The soil also lost nutrients at the high carbon dioxide level.</p>
        <p>"We find it alarming," the scientists said in their report, "that carbon dioxide fertilization can produce losses of soil carbon and the release of nutrients." Even today, they said, the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere "may already represent a massive carbon dioxide overload to some ecosystems."</p>
        <p>In the history of life on earth, primitive plants probably had to cope with a wide range of carbon dioxide levels, including some much higher than today's. But modern plant ecologies are very different from those of the distant past. Before the rise of the dinosaurs, for example, there were no flowering plants or grasses. Modern plant ecologies may be more susceptible to damage by rapidly increasing levels of carbon dioxide than were those of the remote past.</p>
        <p>Although other scientists have studied the effects of elevated carbon dioxide levels on single plants, Dr. Arnone said, the Basel experiments were the first in which entire ecological systems were reproduced. The two scientists have already begun a series of experiments on different ecologies, including one for tropical plants and another for alpine plants. "Results of these, so far, point in the same direction as our rain forest study," he said.</p>
        <p>The experiments suggest not only that food production could be reduced by increased carbon dioxide, but also that the world's plants may not be able to remove as much carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as would be needed to check or reduce the greenhouse warming effect. Plants may already be near a saturation point, Dr. Arnone said, beyond which they cannot remove carbon dioxide from the air any faster than they do now.</p>
