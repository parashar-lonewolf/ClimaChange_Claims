        <p>More than shimmering rings and a smoggy moon the size of a planet set Saturn apart in the solar system. It also has an unusual hot spot at the tip of its south pole.</p>
        <p>Astronomers using the Keck Observatory in Hawaii reported last week that new infrared images showed the warmest temperatures on Saturn existed in the southern polar region, particularly at a compact hot spot at the pole. They said the warm polar vortex, a large-scale weather system like an atmospheric whirlpool, was unlike anything ever observed in the Sun's family of planets.</p>
        <p>Polar vortices are found on Earth, Jupiter, Mars and Venus, but they are colder than their surroundings. On Earth, the Arctic polar vortex is located over eastern North America in Canada and carries cold air to the northern Plains. A polar vortex over Antarctica traps air and is responsible for a gaping hole there in the Earth's protective ozone layer in the upper atmosphere.</p>
        <p>The astronomers were not surprised to see relatively warm temperatures at Saturn's south pole. Because of the planet's tilt and orbit, the pole has been exposed to nine years of continuous sunlight, and previous observations showed hints of a warming. But they did not expect the pattern of warming they see, or the presence of the highest temperatures on the planet to be at the pole.</p>
        <p>''If the increased southern temperatures are solely the result of seasonality,'' said Dr. Glenn S. Orton, an astronomer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, ''then the temperature should increase gradually with increasing latitude, but it doesn't.''</p>
        <p>He said, ''We see that the temperature increases abruptly by several degrees near 70 degrees south latitude and again at 87 degrees south.''</p>
        <p>On Saturn, warm is a relative term. Temperatures in the stratosphere inside the 70-degree boundary are minus 189 degrees Fahrenheit; at the pole, minus 188 degrees. But it is much colder outside the vortex.</p>
        <p>Dr. Orton was leader of the team that conducted the research and described it in the current issue of the journal Science and in an announcement by the Keck Observatory.</p>
        <p>More revealing details are expected in coming months. The Cassini spacecraft, orbiting Saturn, is to focus its heat-sensing instruments on the planet's south polar region, starting in March. Later, Cassini will examine conditions at the north pole.</p>
