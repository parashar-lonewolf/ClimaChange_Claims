        <p>ONE day last February, an astronaut on the Russian space station Mir was preparing to make a batch of life-giving oxygen when the candle-type generator he was using caught fire. Almost instantly, flames were shooting out one to four feet, and chunks of molten metal were flying through the air, splattering a nearby bulkhead. Sparks erupted like fireworks, and smoke billowed through the station, clouding vision and making the air unbreathable.</p>
        <p>Dr. Jerry M. Linenger, an American astronaut on board, grabbed an emergency mask, but no oxygen came out. He seized another while struggling to free fire extinguishers that were still attached to bulkheads with the heavy bolts that had secured them for the launching.</p>
        <p>''I was talking out loud to myself,'' Dr. Linenger recalled in a recent interview. '' 'Jerry, you need to get this fire out. There's no way out of here. Keep your head about you.' ''</p>
        <p>Dr. Linenger and a Russian astronaut emptied three extinguishers on the white-hot flames -- to no avail.</p>
        <p>Finally, 14 minutes after the fire erupted, it went out, largely, Dr. Linenger says, because it smothered in combustion wastes that hung weightless in the air.</p>
        <p>Everyone heaved a sigh of relief, but the crisis was a turning point. Fire in space was no longer considered an abstract possibility, something to ponder as time and budgets allowed. Now, it is getting rapt attention. The more scientists probe fire's mysterious behavior in weightlessness and hunt for better ways to block and fight its dangers, the more surprises they find, like eerie blue flame balls and ghostly white vapor clouds.</p>
        <p>''We are continuously surprised'' by the fire experiments done in spacecraft, said Dr. Howard D. Ross, a combustion official at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. ''It shows that there's still much to be learned.''</p>
        <p>The studies are all the more pressing because of the advent of the international space station, whose construction is scheduled to begin next year. Planned for completion by 2003, it is to be the size of a football field, hold up to seven astronauts  and, like any spacecraft, can tolerate no serious fires.</p>
        <p>Lessons from the Mir crisis are already promising to improve its safety, scientists say. For instance, experts are carefully scrutinizing the foibles and hazards of candle-type oxygen generators, which, at least for the moment, are still planned as backups on the new station despite their nearly undoing Mir.</p>
        <p>''You make things a little bit safer each time you learn something,'' said Dr. Michael D. Pedley, director of space station materials and processes at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston.</p>
        <p>Dr. Pedley added that incremental progress in orbital fire research over the years had been at least as important as the Mir crisis in illuminating risks and improving safety.</p>
        <p>''We had a false impression when we did all our testing on Earth,'' Dr. Pedley said in an interview. ''Now we realize we don't have the margin we once thought we had.'' Some fires, he said, burn all too readily in space.</p>
        <p>A tragic, early lesson came in 1967 when a fire fueled by on-board oxygen supplies destroyed an Apollo capsule on the launching pad, killing three astronauts. After that, pure oxygen in Apollo capsules was replaced with less volatile breathing gases, and new emphasis was put on making spacesuits and capsules out of flame-resistant materials.</p>
        <p>With such safeguards in place, many experts assumed that space travel would be reasonably safe; they reasoned that any fires would quickly go out on their own. That logic was rooted in how flames behave on Earth and the expectation that weightlessness would inhibit them.</p>
        <p>When a candle burns on a birthday cake, the air near the wick heats up, decreasing its density and causing it to rise above the cooler surrounding air. This upward flow is known as convection. Fresh air is continuously drawn to the wick, replenishing the oxygen needed for the fire even as soot and inhibiting wastes are carried up and away.</p>
        <p>But no such flows occur in space. A dense gas acts the same as a light one -- both have no weight, so gases of differing density float side by side.</p>
        <p>A candle burning in weightlessness, experts reasoned, would snuff itself out quickly. With no air currents near the wick, waste gases like carbon dioxide would collect, slowing combustion and soon extinguishing it.</p>
        <p>But experience showed that fire can burn quite nicely in weightlessness -- if very differently -- than on Earth. The surprises include blue flame balls, apparently akin to glowing spheres of ball lightning. The spherical flames can easily burn in  hydrogen, which is widely used as a fuel on piloted spacecraft.</p>
        <p>''I think some could burn for 10 hours,'' said Dr. Paul D. Ronney, an aerospace engineer at the University of Southern California who studies flame balls. To date, they have burned experimentally in orbit for more than eight minutes.</p>
        <p>The first fire experiments of the space age were conducted in drop towers that artificially create a few seconds of weightlessness on platforms that fall like runaway elevators. In 1975, the tests moved to space; astronauts aboard the American Skylab station lit a few blazes inside special chambers designed to contain any dangers.</p>
        <p>It turns out that flames in weightlessness overcome the lack of air currents by simple diffusion, or natural mixing. Flames can spread through oxygenated fuel and often adopt spherical forms. Diffusion is less efficient at mixing gases than air currents, so the flames often burn cooler, cleaner and longer. The lack of soot often makes them blue, and the lack of air currents often makes them uncannily steady.</p>
        <p>Fire studies grew in number and got more detailed as the space shuttles picked up the pace of orbital exploration. NASA's aim was not only fire safety but basic research on combustion, which is far easier to do in weightlessness than in the turbulent flows on Earth.</p>
        <p>In October 1990, a shuttle crew started several fires in a metal chamber, recording the action with cameras and other sensors. The tests showed that flames spread readily across paper and plastic.</p>
        <p>In 1992, shuttle astronauts lit polyurethane foam, showing that it easily smoldered with little exposed flame. The hidden flames produced much higher levels of carbon monoxide than smoldering fires do on Earth, implying a greater risk for humans.</p>
        <p>Also in 1992, the crew studied a major danger: hot wires. In normal gravity, hot air rises during convection and cools off a wire, helping to block overheating. But no such cooling occurs in weightlessness, and each shuttle is innervated by hundreds of miles of wires.</p>
        <p>The flight tests showed that the plastic coverings of wires burned quite readily, but only when a ventilator fan was blowing, driving oxygen into the flames. Such fans are a common way to cool spacecraft wiring in the absence of convection.</p>
        <p>Dr. Ross, of the NASA Lewis Research Center in Cleveland, which runs the agency's orbital fire research, said that switching off fans in an emergency was now being adopted by the international space station as a main way of fighting fires.</p>
        <p>The question of how long fires might burn in weightlessness was tested in 1996 by Dr. Shannon W. Lucid, an American astronaut who has spent more time aboard the Mir station than any other American. She used birthday-sized candles, which burn on Earth for 5 or 10 minutes. In space, she found, they cast heat and light for up to 45 minutes.</p>
        <p>This simple experiment revealed unexpected things about the behavior of fire in space.</p>
        <p>When Dr. Lucid turned on the lights after the experiment, she saw a perfectly round white cloud where the flame had been, only the cloud was two or three times larger.</p>
        <p>''It was just hanging there,'' said Dr. Ross, of the Lewis center. ''What we later realized is that the hot candle wax and wick kept vaporizing and condensing fuel in a fog. It was a fascinating finding that we didn't expect.''</p>
        <p>He added that the finding was important for safety. Firefighters in space now have to think about the steady vaporization of flammable material even after a fire is out.</p>
        <p>The Mir blaze erupted amid this series of studies, catching astronauts and scientists by surprise. Even so, its novel feature -- pure oxygen kindling flames into a blinding frenzy -- was exactly what killed the Apollo crew three decades ago.</p>
        <p>Just days after the crisis, Dr. Linenger, a Navy captain and medical doctor, began his own NASA fire study aboard Mir. His aim was to discover exactly how changes in air flow affected the spread of flames.</p>
        <p>''I took that research very seriously,'' he recalled in a hushed tone. ''I think it's going to save lives.''</p>
        <p>By coincidence, NASA's biggest effort to probe the mysteries of fire in space began just weeks after the Mir blaze, when the shuttle Columbia flew in early April, its crew prepared to set as many as 200 small blazes. The mission was brought down prematurely by a power-supply problem but flew again in July.</p>
        <p>Among the surprises was that some flames grew twice as long as similar ones on Earth. Other flames emitted soot faster than expected. Soot production in weightlessness, or the lack of it, is considered a prime factor in designing smoke detectors for shuttles and stations.</p>
        <p>''We're trying like mad to solve problems,'' said Dr. Gerard M. Faeth, an aerospace engineer at the University of Michigan who does soot studies. ''A lot of what we're doing is finding the way for people coming after us, who will have more time and resources, especially when station is up there.''</p>
        <p>The goals of fire research are expanding, said Dr. Ross of the Lewis center. In the beginning, the work centered on basic research and astronaut safety. Now, he said, it increasingly includes things like learning how soot forms so pollution on Earth can be curbed.</p>
        <p>For space exploration, Dr. Ross said, a new focus is Mars, where NASA would like to send astronauts early in the next century. The long trip, with no possibility of quick escapes back to Earth, would require much new thinking about fire safety.</p>
        <p>And flames might burn quite differently in a spacecraft resting on the surface of the red planet, he added, compared with blazes in the weightlessness of orbit or those convulsed by terrestrial tugs.</p>
        <p>''There's some residual gravity'' on Mars, Dr. Ross said, ''but it's nothing like on Earth. So it's a different problem.''</p>
