        <p>LEAD: As if responding to a prophet crying in the wilderness, experts, supporters and others trooped to the Kansas prairie this weekend to give and take advice on agriculture and its environmental problems.</p>
        <p>As if responding to a prophet crying in the wilderness, experts, supporters and others trooped to the Kansas prairie this weekend to give and take advice on agriculture and its environmental problems.</p>
        <p>It was a symposium billed as ''The Marriage of Ecology and Agriculture.''</p>
        <p>David Pimentel, a professor of entomology at Cornell University, asserted that up to $200 billion of the $700 billion worth of food and fiber the country produces each year is negated by waste. The costs of that waste come from losses such as eroded soils that wash or blow away and pollute the nation's lakes and streams or from the side effects of chemicals that make their users ill and poison the groundwater.</p>
        <p>Wendell Berry, the Kentucky novelist, poet, professor and farmer, and Donald Worster, a specialist in Western history at the University of Kansas, were there to put the problems and the goals in memorable language. Others, like Rhonda Janke from the Rodale Research Center in Kutztown, Pa., offered the 70 participants information about substitutes for pesticides and fertilizers.</p>
        <p>But attention soon focused on the voice in the wilderness that brought them together: Dr. Wes Jackson, who founded an unusual research and educational center, The Land Institute.</p>
        <p>Dr. Jackson's thesis is that much of modern agriculture has been a mistake. It is all right, as he sees it, to cultivate land that is flat, fertile, well watered and not subject to erosion. But the pioneers who ripped away the virgin sod of the prairie to plant wheat and corn committed sacrileges for which man has yet to atone, and the penalties have been erosion, droughts and dust bowls.</p>
        <p>His aim is to mimic nature on the prairie and develop food-producing perennials that could grow intermingled in plots like plants on the natural prairie. Such plants would grow year after year without replanting and, like the vegetation of the wild prairie, would resist insect predators and disease, as well as often providing their own nitrogen.</p>
        <p>His subjects are plants like the wild Illinois bundleflower, a plant with a high-yielding, high-protein seed that is edible but is bitter. But his greatest visible progress has come with a cross between grain sorghum, an annual crop, and Johnson grass, a weed that farmers hate. The result shows promise of developing a root system that would permit it to flourish perennially. Whether the grain it produces will be edible is another question.</p>
        <p>To find the answers Dr. Jackson, a 53-year-old Kansas native, left a career as a college professor 14 years ago to return the prairie and study it. Now he works at the institute with his wife, Dana, four fellow scientists and about a dozen student interns.</p>
        <p>''It seemed to me we needed to focus on the problems of agriculture rather than in agriculture,'' he said in an interview.</p>
        <p>One of the biggest accomplishments so far, he said, is that ''we have fine-tuned our questions.''</p>
        <p>But he cautioned that ''we just don't want people thinking something's going to come out of this next week.''</p>
        <p>To Dr. Pimentel, the Cornell ecologist, one of the principal ironies among the problems of agriculture was the movement to promote alcohol fuels made from corn, or ethanol, as a substitute for gasoline. It takes more fuel energy to grow the corn and process it for ethanol than the ethanol provides, he said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Janke, the Pennsylvanian, offered some of the largest nuggets of optimism. At Rodale, she said, researchers had been able to increase corn yields without chemicals, by planting the seeds among the roots of a plant called hairy vetch, a legume that impregnates the soil with nitrogen.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Herb Bormann, a professor of forest ecology at Yale University who was one of the first investigators to report the dangers of acid rain in North America, warned that the toxification of air, land and water was still increasing.</p>
        <p>Dr. Worster, the Kansas professor, said it was high time for the marriage of ecology and agriculture, adding that ''such a union might one day bring forth a child better than any we have known.''</p>
