        <p>THROUGHOUT history, designers have used the chair to convey images like power (the throne) and movement (with wings and paw feet). Recently Paul Ludick, a New York artist, has been working with the chair as a means of expressing an environmental issue: the fragility of the atmosphere's ozone layer. In the process he produced 30, all of which can be seen in ''O Zone,'' an exhibition at the Bernice Steinbaum Gallery (132 Greene Street, near Houston Street) through July 15.</p>
        <p>''The chairs themselves represent man's built environment,'' Mr. Ludick said. ''Rocks, collected by friends from all over the world, form each of the seats. And every chair is draped in a silk chiffon bag, which represents the Earth's ozone layer.''</p>
        <p>Ten pounds of rocks were gathered for each of the 30 different chairs. On the back of each, the artist wrote the name of the town where the rocks were collected. About 15 different countries and 15 different communities in the United States are represented, he said.</p>
        <p>While sitting on rocks may seem unappealing, a foam-rubber base makes each chair quite comfortable, Mr. Ludick said, adding, ''I like to have an element of surprise in all my designs.''  CURRENTS</p>
