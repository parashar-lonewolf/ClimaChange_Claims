        <p>The big man in pinstripes walks into the convention center here and the diplomats take notice. The Japanese delegation asks for a few minutes of his time. South African officials whisper in his ear. In their offices nearby, senior American officials praise his leadership.</p>
        <p>The unlikely celebrity, who has a cellphone glued to his ear, chuckles at all the fuss.</p>
        <p>He is John Ashe, a 48-year-old engineer (with a doctoral dissertation called ''Electric-Field-Induced Deformation of Biological Cells'') and an ambassador for one of the world's smallest countries, Antigua and Barbuda (population 67,000). He is, as he cheerfully admits, little known outside the world of international environmental conferences.</p>
        <p>But here, at the United Nations' World Summit on Sustainable Development, Mr. Ashe is one of the most influential diplomats. He is chairman of the meeting's trade and finance committee -- the man charged with bringing together the rich and poor nations, which are feuding over how to reduce poverty while preserving the environment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ashe honed his skills as a negotiator in conferences on global warming and climate change, where he has represented Antigua and other small island nations for more than a decade. But this job, diplomats say, might call for a miracle worker.</p>
        <p>Officials here agree that reducing poverty must be a central element of the summit meeting's action plan -- that poor nations cannot safeguard their natural riches without strengthening their economies. But the question of how to reduce poverty has bedeviled nations and threatened efforts to produce a solid plan to protect the environment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ashe acknowledges that the negotiations have been tough. But as he peeled a banana and poured some tea this morning, the possibility of failure seemed far from his mind.</p>
        <p>''In many instances, the positions are polar opposites; and on both sides there's a bit of pushing the envelope,'' he said. ''But there is movement and any movement at all in this debate is progress. It's slow, but it's positive.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ashe is tall and intense with a taste for conservative suits and for meetings behind closed doors. He was quietly negotiating the latest text on trade and finance today as poor countries were speaking out on the floor of the meeting to demand an end to the agricultural subsidies that make it difficult for them to export to wealthy countries.</p>
        <p>He says he became aware of the impact people have on the environment as he was growing up in St. John's, the capital. As a boy, he dreamed of becoming an astronaut but also noticed the pollution in the waters and the garbage on land. He earned a doctorate in engineering at the University of Pennsylvania and became Antigua's science attach√© to the United Nations in 1989.</p>
        <p>At the United Nations, he learned that global warming poses severe threats to small island nations and became deeply involved in the negotiations over climate change. Experts predict that sea levels will rise if greenhouse gas emissions are not controlled and that small islands might be flooded.</p>
        <p>But as Mr. Ashe considered how to forestall such calamity, he realized that his country -- which is about twice the size of the District of Columbia -- could not afford to take all of the necessary preventive measures, such as building sea walls and relocating beach communities.</p>
        <p>''Ultimately, this comes down to money,'' said Mr. Ashe, who is now Antigua's ambassador to the United Nations. ''There's no free lunch. To do certain things, you need funding.''</p>
        <p>Many of his colleagues say that Mr. Ashe strives to remain neutral and to find a balance between opposing positions. This week, a senior American official praised his proposed wording in the paragraphs of the action plan devoted to finance and trade. ''We think it's a very good middle ground,'' the official said.</p>
        <p>But some officials and environmentalists contend that Mr. Ash has conceded too much to rich countries, allowing them to avoid having to promise to reduce the subsidies to their own people that hurt poor nations. In the original draft implementation plan, rich countries were asked to ''reduce, or as appropriate, eliminate'' tariffs on certain goods from developing countries.</p>
        <p>In Mr. Ashe's compromise text, rich countries are asked to ''aim to reduce, or as appropriate, eliminate'' those tariffs.</p>
        <p>''The problem is that he's allowed the U.S. and the European countries to really set the agenda by putting their vision of trade liberalization and globalization into the negotiated text,'' said David Waskow, a policy analyst for Friends of the Earth, an advocacy group. ''Sustainable development has not been the highest priority.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ashe says his record on the environment speaks for itself and he shrugs off criticism, which he says is inevitable. ''That's the nature of the job,'' he said. ''It's not a beauty contest.''</p>
        <p>In any case, he knows that the complaints, the flattery and the incessant jangling of his silver cellphone will all come to an end when the summit meeting closes next week. After that, he says, he looks forward to finishing a book about small islands and climate change and to continuing his efforts to protect the earth.</p>
        <p>''It consumes me,'' Mr. Ashe said of his work. ''It's what I do. It's what I feel deeply about. I have kids and I would like to think that I could make a contribution to a better world for them.''</p>
