        <p>NO global environmental problem captured the world's attention as quickly as the erosion of the ozone layer, a molecular veil that shields Earth from ultraviolet radiation. Recognition that most of the damage came from a group of synthetic chemicals -- chlorofluorocarbons, or CFC's -- led in 1987 to the passage of a treaty, the Montreal Protocol, phasing out the substances.</p>
        <p>Now, 14 years after the treaty took effect, scientists have for the first time reported that the ozone layer shows encouraging signs of healing.</p>
        <p>So far, all that has been detected is a slowing of the rate of destruction of ozone, not a turnaround, but many leading scientists said this was the first clear sign that humans could recognize a long-term environmental threat, find a solution and work as a global community to repair the harm.</p>
        <p>Some said this should energize those pressing for enactment of the Kyoto Protocol, the treaty aimed at curbing gases linked to global warming. But many experts said the parallels do not hold. The handful of manufacturers of CFC's quickly found cheap, safer substitutes. In contrast, the gas most linked to warming, carbon dioxide, is produced every time someone boots a computer or starts a car, and no one has found a cheap substitute for the fuels that are its source, coal and oil. The threat from rising temperatures is far less tangible than that from ultraviolet radiation, which raises skin cancer rates.</p>
