        <p>LEAD: Leaders of eight national environmental groups wrote to President Bush today, complaining that his promises to protect the environment are being undercut by his chief of staff, John H. Sununu.</p>
        <p>Leaders of eight national environmental groups wrote to President Bush today, complaining that his promises to protect the environment are being undercut by his chief of staff, John H. Sununu.</p>
        <p>The letter said Mr. Sununu had recently intervened to weaken Administration policies for dealing with global warming, wetlands protection and legislation to strengthen the Clean Air Act in ways ''that not only adversely affected the environment, but also broke pledges you have made to the American public.''</p>
        <p>''The direct, personal involvement of your chief of staff in reversing your pledges is driving a wedge between you and conservationists,'' the letter said.</p>
        <p>The groups asked for an ''emergency meeting'' with the President to clarify his positions on environmental issues.</p>
        <p>Sununu's Role Getting Attention</p>
        <p>The role of Mr. Sununu on environmental issues has stirred considerable attention in recent weeks. Environmental lobbyists say he is increasingly asserting his leverage at the expense of William K. Reilly, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sununu, a mechanical engineer by training, has generally taken a more skeptical view of environmental issues than Mr. Reilly, whose appointment had been applauded by environmental groups as a sign that Mr. Bush would adhere to his campaign promise to be ''the environmental President.''</p>
        <p>The White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said today that President Bush's decisions on environmental policies ''represent his point of view and priorities.''</p>
        <p>At today's regular White House news briefing, Mr. Fitzwater said Mr. Sununu simply prepares options for the President's consideration and ''insures that all points of view are heard.''</p>
        <p>The groups sending the letter were the National Wildlife Federation, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the National Audubon Society, the Environmental Policy Institute, the Wilderness Society, the Sierra Club, Defenders of Wildlife and the Izaak Walton League of America.</p>
        <p>At a news conference called to make the letter public, Jay Hair, president of the National Wildlife Federation, said, ''Either Governor Sununu is marching to a different drummer on the President's stated environmental goals or he is undercutting these goals with the President's approval.''</p>
        <p>Clean Air Act Complaints</p>
        <p>Environmental commissioners from 13 states with serious air pollution problems also asserted today that backroom negotiations between the Administration and Senate leaders are weakening pending clean air legislation as well as the original Clean Air Act of 1970.</p>
        <p>''We find it ironic that in the year of the 20th anniversary of Earth Day, the President would seek to weaken to Clean Air Act,'' Thomas C. Jorling, New York State's Commissioner of Environmental Conservation, said at a news conference here.</p>
        <p>In a letter to Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader, the environmental commissioners, including those from New York, New Jersey and California, pointed out specific provisions of the tentative agreement reached by Administration and Senate negotiators that, they said, would weaken efforts to reduce air pollution.</p>
        <p>One was the deletion of the original law's requirement that the Federal Government must step in and impose a plan for achieving the goals of the law in any state where the state government fails to do so.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mitchell said in a telephone interview this afternoon that the negotiations would produce a bill stronger than current law. He also defended the closed negotiations, saying that there were so many objections to the bill pending in the Senate, a filibuster could not be avoided without changes.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Jorling said that decisions on the clean air bill should be made in an open vote on the floor of the Senate.</p>
