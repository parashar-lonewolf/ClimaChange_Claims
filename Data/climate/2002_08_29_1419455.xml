        <p>For days now, the battle between rich and poor nations has dominated the United Nations talks here on the environment and development, with marches and fiery debates over how to reduce poverty.</p>
        <p>But one of the fiercest struggles has been raging behind the scenes as the United States and the European Union clash over strategies to preserve the planet.</p>
        <p>The allies are battling over the question of targets and time frames for the conversion from oil and gas to windmills and solar panels, for the cleanup of garbage and hazardous pollutants and for the preservation of endangered plants and animals.</p>
        <p>The European Union says these talks must produce a strong plan with firm deadlines so the world's leaders can be held accountable for their actions. The United States opposes targets and deadlines, saying it would rather finance specific projects than support goals that might ultimately prove meaningless.</p>
        <p>The negotiators on both sides are still cordial. But everyone agrees that the dispute has aggravated tensions that have been simmering since President Bush angered his European colleagues last year by refusing to ratify an international treaty aimed at preventing global warming. Nowhere is that rift more visible than in the debate over renewable energy.</p>
        <p>Scientists say the industrialized nations are endangering the earth by using fossil fuels that contribute to global warming. Renewable energy sources like wind power and solar energy produce smaller and more expensive amounts of electricity than plants using traditional fuels, but renewable energy sources generate a tiny fraction of the carbon dioxide and gases that are believed to accelerate global warming.</p>
        <p>Under the plan favored by the European Union, nations would commit to ensuring that renewable energy sources account for 15 percent of the world's total energy production by 2010. The United States has rejected such proposals. Canada and Saudi Arabia, significant producers of fossil fuels, have also objected. With both sides digging in their heels today, the talks seemed deadlocked.</p>
        <p>''We have a range of issues -- renewable energy, sanitation, hazardous chemicals and the reversal of the decline in biodiversity,'' Yvon Slingenberg, a senior member of the European delegation, said in an interview. ''On all of those issues, we have not managed to convince them.''</p>
        <p>American officials dismissed such criticism. In the coming days, the United States will announce programs aimed at providing clean water and reliable electricity in developing countries. Action, they insist, matters more than words.</p>
        <p>''We have maintained consistently that targets alone will not deliver the energy services needed,'' said Griff Thompson, the director of the Office of Energy, Environment and Technology for the United States Agency for International Development. ''It's not the words in and of themselves that will electrify classrooms.''</p>
        <p>David Garman, an assistant secretary in the Department of Energy, said the United States was focusing on trying to reduce the costs of renewable energy, which is still more costly than coal or gas. ''Renewable energy is great because it's clean,'' he said. ''It also tends to be more expensive.''</p>
        <p>But at the talks here, the United States has been repeatedly, and sharply, criticized for refusing to commit to concrete obligations.</p>
        <p>Today Representative Dennis J. Kucinich, Democrat of Ohio, and Jerry Brown, the Democratic mayor of Oakland, assailed the Bush administration's energy policy at a news conference here. They called for a new commitment to solar power and an end to fuel subsidies.</p>
        <p>''There are people in the administration who will say, 'We don't need to talk about timetables,' '' Mr. Kucinich said. ''But when scientists can show that over a period of time that global warming can, in fact, impact on the increase in world temperature, we better be talking about timetables.''</p>
        <p>The debate, however, is more nuanced than some American critics suggest.</p>
        <p>The United Nations describes the United States as a pioneer in renewable energy; it is already one of the largest producers of wind energy in the world, even though the technology is still costly. Even the European Union has rejected proposals favored by environmentalists that would demand an even larger commitment to renewable energy.</p>
        <p>''You can't say that the Europeans are dashing around reducing emissions furiously,'' said Gordon Shepherd, the director of international policy at the World Wildlife Fund. ''But they have acknowledged that they have to. They've sent a message that things must change.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Shepherd said he believed the two sides would come to some sort of consensus, even if it meant horse trading on certain issues. But negotiators were not predicting an easy breakthrough.</p>
        <p>''We've not made any progress,'' an American official said of the negotiations today. Asked whether he thought the two sides could bridge the gap, he shook his head and said, ''I'm not sure.''</p>
