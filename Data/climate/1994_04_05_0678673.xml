        <p>A $35 MILLION test of a new way to measure the temperature of the world's oceans was delayed last week and may be canceled altogether amid accusations that it threatens to harm whales and other marine mammals. The dispute is unusual in that it pits two arms of the environmental movement against one another: those trying to fight global warming and those trying to protect endangered animals.</p>
        <p>The experiment, run by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, Calif., and involving seven nations, would send sounds from underwater speakers across the Pacific Ocean at least once a day every day for two years. Sound travels faster in warm water than cold. In theory, the test should be able to detect changes in the sound's speed as it crosses the Pacific that would reveal temperature shifts as subtle as one-hundredth of a degree Fahrenheit.</p>
        <p>Such measurements would be unique by virtue of their geographical extent, across thousands of miles of deep ocean, and are seen as a bonanza for researchers trying to track global warming caused by a buildup of polluting gases in the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>"It's fundamental to helping document and interpret long-term climate change," Dr. James E. Hansen, director of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York City and a prominent analyst of global warming, said in an interview. "There's nothing comparable." Oceans' Effects on Climate</p>
        <p>"The ocean is the flywheel of the climate system," he said. "It provides the thermal inertia. In addition, it's one of the best places to look for climate change, because the changes occur slowly. It slowly stores up the heat, averaging out the weather noise."</p>
        <p>Thus, he said, the sound experiment would be "very valuable."</p>
        <p>But the test, whose underwater loudspeakers would rumble off the Monterey coast of California and the Hawaiian island of Kauai, has raised strong protests from biologists and environmental groups who fear it could hurt whales and other marine mammals. They argue that the scientific uncertainties on mammalian effects are too great for the experiment to be switched on without further study of possible consequences. Most alarmingly, a few experts say the sounds could deafen whales, leaving them unable to navigate or find food.</p>
        <p>The temperature experts dismiss that assertion as ridiculous and express indignation at being accused of such cruelty. At worst, the Scripps scientists say, the sound is similar in intensity to that generated by a large merchant or cruise ship. And the underwater speakers are to be more than a half-mile down. Even if a whale were to swim up to one of them, they say, the effect would be no worse than listening to a loud rock band is for a human, perhaps making the animal uncomfortable.</p>
        <p>The clash has put the sound experiment, originally planned to begin this month, on indefinite hold. Hearing on Plan</p>
        <p>Mediating the dispute is the National Marine Fisheries Service, an arm of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration that enforces the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 and must approve the research. It held a hearing on the plan on March 22 in Washington and afterward was besieged by a blizzard of faxes, letters, telephone calls and complaints, including sharp questions from California's Senators, Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer. It now plans to hold three more public hearings, one in California and two in Hawaii, pushing back the earliest possible start for the experiment to May or June.</p>
        <p>Scripps scientists fear the process has become so politicized that the research is threatened with having its plug pulled. "There's been a flood of letters saying we're doing wicked things," said Dr. Walter Munk, a respected oceanographer who is the chief scientist on the project. "It's absurd. We're hoping to get the facts out to help people realize that we're not ending the world."</p>
        <p>Some environmentalists are deeply worried that the scientists are more interested in protecting their experiment and financing than in considering whether noise pollution could hurt such endangered animals as the humpback whale, which is found at the proposed transmission sites. They note accumulating research that suggests that sharp underwater sounds can harm marine mammals.</p>
        <p>"If you further damage the patient, the earth, while you try to take its temperature, then maybe the method is flawed," said Dr. Sylvia A. Earle, a noted marine biologist and a former chief scientist of the oceanographic agency.</p>
        <p>The ocean is already far from pristine acoustically. The clamor comes from industrial underwater explosions, ocean drilling, oil rig construction, ship engines, icebreakers, submarine sonar devices, supersonic aircraft and countless other human sources of noise. Recent research suggests the rising cacophony could temporarily or permanently impair the hearing of some marine mammals, hurting their ability to communicate or navigate.</p>
        <p>Scripps scientists say $2.9 million of their budget has been set aside to study any possible effects of their sound project on marine mammals, potentially greatly increasing what is known about their acoustic sensitivities. And they insist that if any possible adverse effects cannot be mitigated, the speakers will immediately be switched off.</p>
        <p>Public agitation is driven in part by the fact that the California speaker is to be in the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, which stretches south from San Francisco Bay to an area past Big Sur along the rugged coastline and is home to everything from whales and squids to seals and sea otters. Scripps scientists say the area was chosen because of electrical hookups from the Navy's system of underwater listening devices.</p>
        <p>"That's their excuse," Dr. Linda S.  Weilgart, a scientist in Nova Scotia who studies whale vocalization and testified against the project at the Washington hearing, said in an interview. "It shows the most gross insensitivity and wanton disregard of marine mammal welfare."</p>
        <p>The project is also viewed suspiciously by some environmentalists because it is financed by the Pentagon, which in many areas is trying to beat swords into plowshares. Nations Joining in Study</p>
        <p>From a depth of about 3,000 feet, speakers off California and Hawaii are to rumble with low-frequency noises six times a day for 20 minutes at a time. After an initial shakedown period of two months, the 20-minute sound blast is to be cut back to once a day, said Dr. David W. Hyde, the project director at Scripps.</p>
        <p>Receivers are to be scattered throughout the Pacific and operated by Australia, Canada, France, Russia, New Zealand, South Africa and the United States. The two-year sound experiment is a feasibility test. If successful, the scientists would want to conduct a long-term program of monitoring the ocean's temperature with sound, since global warming of the ocean would be measurable only over a longperiod.</p>
