        <p>Lost, Hungry Penguins</p>

        <p>Lost, Hungry Penguins</p>
        <p>Brazilian beaches are famous for a lot of things, but the presence of hordes of young penguins is not usually one of them.</p>
        <p>But zoologists at the University of Washington who study Magellanic penguins say the small birds, which nest along Argentina's coast, are turning up in record numbers in Brazil. The reason, they say, is that the waters off the Atlantic coast remained colder than normal this year, keeping the squid and small fish that make up the birds' diet farther to the north for longer.</p>
        <p>Magellanic penguins, which are about two feet tall and recognizable by broad black bands under their chins and across their chests, typically travel north to Brazil during their winter migration, returning to nesting sites in Argentina in September and October (the southern spring).</p>
        <p>The researchers, whose work was supported in part by the Wildlife Conservation Society, say that what is unusual this year is that many of the birds are young, and many are dying or going ashore  half-starved, having stayed too long up north. The researchers suggest that these young birds did fine until the waters started to warm up, but then they were unable to locate enough food and became too weak to return.</p>
        <p>The cold water has also caused changes in the birds' nesting habits. The researchers studied 116 nests at an Argentine reserve and found that about two-thirds had been abandoned. Because the food  was so far away, it was taking males much longer to return from foraging missions. The females became too hungry to wait and left their nests in search of food.</p>
        <p>Threat to Rice Crops</p>
        <p>If society did not have enough reasons to worry about possible global warming, here is another one: even modest temperature increases predicted by some climate forecasts could be enough to reduce rice yields significantly over the next century.</p>
        <p>Researchers at the University of Florida tested several varieties of rice, growing them in chambers that simulated various temperature-change situations. They found that although the rice plants flourished no matter what the temperature, yields of grains declined precipitously. The more modest temperature increases, the researchers say, could reduce rice yields by 20 to 40 percent by 2100, while the larger increases predicted by more dire forecasts could cut rice production essentially to zero.</p>
        <p>The researchers tested a rice variety grown in tropical climates and one grown in more temperate areas. They had thought that the tropical variety, at least, would be able to cope with the heat, but that proved not to be the case.</p>
        <p>Since rice is a staple food for about two-thirds of the world's population, largely in underdeveloped regions, this is not good news. What is needed, the researchers suggest, is the development of more heat-tolerant varieties of the crop.</p>
        <p>Satellites Back to Earth</p>
        <p>When it comes to orbital activity, the space shuttle gets most of the attention, particularly these days with the building of the International Space Station. But there are a lot of other comings and goings as well.</p>
        <p>Late last month, for example, the first Iridium communications satellite re-entered the atmosphere, breaking up over the Arctic Ocean. The satellite was one of about 70 launched as part of Iridium's grand plan to offer satellite phone service around the world. The project proved extremely expensive and subscribers were few, and the company filed for bankruptcy last year.</p>
        <p>At first it was thought that all the satellites would have to come down. But Iridium's assets were recently bought by another company, which has obtained a Pentagon contract to supply phone service. So most of the satellites have been saved, at least for now. The one that re-entered the atmosphere on Nov. 29 is one of two that were never operational, having encountered stability problems shortly after launching. The other satellite is expected to come down on Sunday.</p>
