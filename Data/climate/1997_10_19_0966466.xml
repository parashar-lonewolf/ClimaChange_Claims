        <p>Danube's Vast Wetlands Are Being Restored</p>
        <p>At the immense delta of the Danube River, engineers from several countries are trying to reverse one of the biggest land-grabs in recent history, when the previous Romanian Government tried to turn wetlands into farmland. They have punched gaps in dikes and dams and begun to let the river spill back over the land.</p>

        <p>Rise in Health Premiums Of at Least 5% Is Expected  After four years of near stability brought about by the spread of managed care, the premiums that most Americans pay for their health insurance are poised to rise significantly next year, industry groups and health care consultants report.</p>
        <p>Many say the average charge for health benefits, deducted from paychecks, will go up at least 5 percent, or more than twice as much as wages and inflation.</p>
        <p>1</p>
        <p>Interest Groups Join Debate  A diverse array of civic, religious, business and labor groups -- including the American Heart Association, the Gray Panthers and the National Rural Letter Carriers' Association -- are actively taking part in the often-arcane campaign finance debate over unregulated soft money, issue advertisements and political action committees. Their effect on the issue suggests that the procedural votes the Senate held this month are unlikely to be the last word.</p>

        <p>Battle on Bankruptcy Revisions  Even before sending it to Congress, the authors of a proposed revision to the Federal bankruptcy law have begun squabbling over its conclusions.

        <p>New Round of White Flight  In a smaller-scale rerun of an exodus from central cities to the suburbs a generation ago, many whites are leaving ethnically and racially diverse metropolitan areas, including many close-in suburbs, for more far-flung rural areas.</p>

        <p>Who Is Rudolph W. Giuliani?  He is praised by supporters and adversaries alike as an effective leader, a ubiquitous action hero of Gotham, hurrying from a burned-out building to a subway derailment to the bedside of a wounded police officer. But Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has also stood out for his temperament. To question his righteounsness is to risk his wrath.</p>

        <p>Luxury Medical Care  At a time when hospitals are struggling to adjust to tumbling reimbursement rates from insurers, some of the more ambitious institutions in the New York area are offering luxury rooms to those who can pay. The rooms, which can cost as much as $1,000 a day, bring panoramic views, deluxe furnishings and meals prepared to order.</p>

        <p>Campaign Spending Spree</p>
        <p>Four years ago, Andrew S. Eristoff ignored the city's voluntary campaign spending limits and spent $900,000 -- most of it his own money -- to win his City Council seat. This year, the Manhattan Republican has raised $315,000 to fend off a Democrat's challenge in what is sure to be the city's most expensive Council race.</p>
