        <p>LEAD: THE question of what to do about acid rain has pitted region against region and produced an angry stalemate in Congress for the better part of a decade. Now, with President Bush backing action and with a realignment of forces on Capitol Hill, a revised Clean Air Act with strong acid rain controls is a distinct likelihood, perhaps as early as this year.</p>
        <p>THE question of what to do about acid rain has pitted region against region and produced an angry stalemate in Congress for the better part of a decade. Now, with President Bush backing action and with a realignment of forces on Capitol Hill, a revised Clean Air Act with strong acid rain controls is a distinct likelihood, perhaps as early as this year.</p>
        <p>In his recent budget message, Mr. Bush said he is ''committed to ending the long debate on acid rain.'' In Ottawa last week, he pledged to reduce acid rain, a problem that has placed a significant strain on relations between Canada and the United States.</p>
        <p>It is not yet clear how much of a commitment he is willing to make or who he believes should bear the enormous cleanup costs. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that various proposals to cut the pollution that causes acid rain by about 50 percent would cost from $16 billion to $33 billion over the next 20 years. Scientists believe that cutting the pollution in half would lead to a similar reduction in acid rain.</p>
        <p>President Reagan never suggested clean air legislation to Congress and he opposed regulatory program to control acid rain, which is caused by sulfur and nitrogen oxides emitted by coal-fired power plants, auto exhaust and other sources. His Administration argued that more research was needed before expensive changes were imposed on industry, particularly electric utilities and their rate payers. ''The main reason we have not had an acid rain bill is clear: the Reagan Administration opposed it and permitted the utility and coal interests that opposed it to have full sway in Congress,'' said Richard Ayres, chairman of the National Clean Air Coalition, an alliance of environmental and consumer groups.</p>
        <p>Senator Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia, who opposed acid rain controls for years because he feared they would cost jobs for coal miners, has stepped down as Senate majority leader. He was replaced by Senator George Mitchell, Democrat of Maine, who has led the forces pressing for controls on acid rain.</p>
        <p>The E.P.A. is now drafting the Bush Administration's proposal, which will include amendments for dealing with urban smog and toxic air pollution as well as with acid rain. The proposal would give the states the flexibility to reduce sulfur and nitrogen emissions in the least expensive ways. And it would encourage the use of market mechanisms, such as permitting the trading of pollution rights, to help achieve the reductions.  Who Should Pay?</p>
        <p>But agency officials said that they still must decide how much reduction in pollution to require, who should pay for the controls and what would be done for coal miners who might be put out of work by the new rules.</p>
        <p>When the Clean Air Act was last amended in 1977 acid rain was not widely recognized or well understood. Produced from oxides of sulfur and nitrogen that change chemically in the atmosphere, acid rain is now recognized as destructive to freshwater life in many lakes and streams, particularly in the Northeast and Canada. Acid rain is also believed to contribute to the deterioration of forests and buildings and to threaten human health.</p>
        <p>Much of the pollution comes from the smokestacks of coal-fired power plants in the Midwest that were heightened to comply with the Clean Air Act of 1970. Higher smokestacks improved air quality around the plants, but the pollution is carried by prevailing winds, often hundreds of miles to the Northeast and into Canada. Northeastern states and the Canadian Government have demanded that steps be taken to curb the pollution. But Midwestern states have vigorously opposed controls. Over the past eight years, repeated efforts to enact acid rain controls have failed. Some bills would have required scrubbers to remove pollution before it emerges from the smokestack. Others would have let states or utilities decide whether to use scrubbers or to switch to coal with a lower sulfur content. Most legislation called for cutting sulfur pollution by at least half of the more than 20 million tons spewed into the atmosphere each year. More difficult to control would be nitrogen oxides, much of which come from automobile exhaust. While some legislation called for utilities and their rate payers to bear cleanup costs, other proposals would have spread costs through a tax on electricity rates.</p>
        <p>Susan Roth, a spokeswoman for the Edison Electric Institute, which represents privately owned power companies, said that legislators should wait for the Government's 10-year study of acid rain, which is due next year. She said that technology is being developed that would enable plants to burn coal more efficiently. Scrubbers would increase carbon dioxide emissions because more coal would be needed to produce the same amount of electricity, she said. Carbon dioxide is the gas considered most responsible for the greenhouse effect.</p>
        <p>''The yardstick to judge the Administration's proposal will be whether they will cut pollution in half by the year 2000,'' said Frederic D. Krupp, executive director of the Environmental Defense Fund. ''If so, it will show they have distanced themselves from the Reagan Administration. If not, it will speak for itself.''  WHERE THE BATTLE WILL BE FOUGHT</p>
        <p>Curbing acid rain will require reductions in emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, which can be transformed in the atmosphere into acids. Some experts propose reducing emissions to half the 1987 levels of just over 20 million tons each. Clean air laws have helped reduce sulfur pollutants over the last two decades, as the chart at right shows, but they remain a major threat and without further controls their level may climb again.  SULFUR DIOXIDE</p>
        <p>Coal-burning electric power plants are the biggest source of sulfur dioxide emissions, which can be reduced with expensive smokestack scrubbers. A high level of pollutants from utilities in Midwestern states, right, blows to the Northeast and Canada, adding to the acidity of rainfall in those areas.  NITROGEN OXIDES</p>
        <p>The largest share of nitrogen oxide pollution comes from the nation's growing number of automobiles, although utilities and industry also contribute significantly. Controlling nitrogen oxides is difficult because their sources are so varied and dispersed.  PATTERNS OF POLLUTION</p>
        <p>Density by region of sulfur dioxide emissions, above, and nitrogen oxide emissions, below, in 1980, the latest year for which data have been compiled.</p>
