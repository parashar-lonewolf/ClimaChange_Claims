        <p>A conference that is supposed to cap more than two years of negotiations on what to do about global warming opened here today amid widespread concern that too many hard issues remained to allow the completion of an effective agreement before the talks end in nine days.</p>
        <p>''This negotiation hasn't matured; it's like new wine, and I don't know if we can ferment it in time,'' said Melinda Kimble, a senior State Department official who is leading the United States delegation until the higher-level ministerial phase of the talks begins next Monday.</p>
        <p>Today, however, Ms. Kimble hinted at some flexibility in the American position on setting targets for reduction of gases that trap heat in the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>After more than two years of bargaining, delegates from more than 150 countries are meeting for their final session in the high-tech Kyoto International Conference Hall, set among lovely hills, gardens and ponds in this ancient capital and repository of traditional Japanese culture.</p>
        <p>Surrounded by thousands of lobbyists and journalists from around the world, the negotiators are trying to agree not just on the amount by which emissions of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide should be cut over the next 10 to 20 years, and on what schedule, but also on how to share the burden, what gases to include and how to structure the immensely complex task.</p>
        <p>The job has turned out to be more complicated and difficult than was envisioned in March 1995, when parties to the 1992 Rio treaty on climate change decided that stronger action was needed, say many who are involved. In 1995, it was seen simply as a matter of deciding on a reduction target and a timetable for the industrialized countries. Now it has broadened to include the highly contentious role of developing nations, as well as a number of elaborate mechanisms by which the reductions might be carried out.</p>
        <p>As a result, many experts say, there is a distinct possibility that the talks will not be concluded here, at least not fully, and will have to be extended much as were negotiations on setting up the World Trade Organization -- a task that took more than a decade.</p>
        <p>But not everyone is pessimistic, and Ms. Kimble today sent a signal that prompted Michael Zammit Cutajar, the Maltese executive secretary of the United Nations climate secretariat, to declare that ''the negotiation is on its way.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Kimble said at the opening session of the conference of parties to the 1992 Rio climate treaty, under which the talks are being held, that the United States would no longer insist on a flat-rate, one-size-fits-all reduction target for all countries.  Instead, she said, the Americans were ''prepared to consider the possibility of limited, carefully bounded differentiation'' of targets among industrialized countries.</p>
        <p>Different targets for different countries, tailored to their economic and social profiles, have emerged as a possible way to get around the impasse among rich countries over what targets and timetables for reductions they should adopt. The European Union, Japan and Russia have all proposed variations on the theme of differentiation, but the United States had until today declined to join in what could ultimately be the key to an agreement on one of the talks' two central issues.</p>
        <p>On the other central issue -- how soon developing countries should be bound by specific reductions targets and timetables -- Ms. Kimble said they need not take the same form as those of rich nations. Rather, she suggested, the poorer countries might voluntarily, or as a result of future negotiations, adopt emission growth targets.</p>
        <p>The Clinton Administration has said it will sign no agreement that does not include all countries, and Ms. Kimble's statement was the clearest indication so far of what sort of participation by developing countries might be acceptable to the United States.</p>
        <p>But the developing countries have insisted all along, and reiterated today, that consideration of specific commitments for themselves is out of the question until the richer nations demonstrate that they are actually reducing emissions. The rationale is that since the rich countries got wealthy by burning the coal and oil that emit carbon dioxide and are the biggest emitters of the gas, they should lead the way.</p>
        <p>The United States insists that the developing countries should take on additional commitments, beyond a very general injunction to take steps to reduce emissions required by the 1992 treaty, because their emissions will outstrip those of the rich countries early in the next century.</p>
        <p>Scientists advising the negotiators say that if emissions are not reduced, the average global surface temperature will rise by 2 to 6 degrees Fahrenheit over the next century. This, say the scientists, would cause sea levels to rise, many coastal zones and small island countries to be inundated, climatic zones to shift, rainstorms to become heavier, floods and droughts to become worse, heat waves to become more lethal and some natural ecosystems to disappear.</p>
        <p>Any agreement in Kyoto on reductions would be considered a first step, since none of the proposals now on the table for industrialized countries' emission reductions would stop overall greenhouse gas concentrations from continuing to accumulate in the atmosphere; they would merely reduce the rate a bit.</p>
        <p>One of the most stringent reduction proposals on the table, advanced by the European Union, would limit overall emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide to 7.5 percent below 1990 levels by 2005 and 15 percent by 2010.</p>
        <p>The United States has proposed that levels be stabilized at 1990 levels in the period 2008 through 2112. The Administration says that would trim emissions by 30 percent from what they would be in the absence of any action.</p>
        <p>The American proposal diverges from all others under consideration in that it applies to a larger ''basket'' of six greenhouse gases that also includes hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexachloride. The Administration argues that this is an environmentally friendlier course, but a harder one that would not allow the Europeans to achieve their proposed goals.</p>
        <p>''I do not see a major difference between the U.S. and the E.U.,'' said Hiroshi Ohki of Japan, who today was elected president of the conference of parties to the 1992 treaty that are meeting here. He said he believed that the industrialized countries could come to an accommodation.</p>
        <p>In addition to the developing-country issue, a number of time-consuming and intricate technical problems must also be dealt with. Among these are the question of how to structure an emission-trading system that the United States says would cut the cost of reduction; which greenhouse gases to include in a reduction regime; the degree to which forests (which absorb carbon dioxide) should be considered in giving credit for reductions, and how differentiated targets could be devised and applied.</p>
        <p>If time runs out, say some representatives of environmental groups, extending the talks would be better than producing a flawed agreement that pleases no one -- and that might not be ratified by key countries like the United States -- just for the sake of having an accord.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zammit Cutajar remained optimistic. ''We have a lot of time,'' he said, ''10 whole days and nights.''</p>
