        <p>Oil is often described majestically as the lifeblood of the global economy, the fluid that courses through major arteries and fuels the industrial pulse. But after three hours spent watching ''Extreme Oil,'' the crude energy source seems more an addictive stimulant that leaves a mess after use and drives its dependents to madness just to acquire more.</p>
        <p>This adventurous three-part series, which begins tonight on consecutive Mondays on most PBS stations, diagnoses the thirst for oil as desperate and unquenchable, and given this dependence -- 77 million barrels are consumed daily worldwide -- a taste for other renewable energy sources seems far off or far-fetched. So ''Extreme Oil'' wonders where new underground reservoirs might be tapped, and describes how each site then becomes an ecological or geopolitical danger zone.</p>
        <p>Oil lurking under rocks is like money growing on trees for the companies that know best how to retrieve it. This series first travels the 1,100-mile route of the half-completed Caspian-to-Mediterranean pipeline. Then the program revisits sins of extraction in Angola and Ecuador.</p>
        <p>Finally, the northern coastal plains of Alaska are surveyed with a discussion of the environmental harm expected with proposed drilling.</p>
        <p>In its Canadian debut this summer, ''Extreme Oil'' was more heatedly titled ''Oil: The World Over a Barrel.'' Nonetheless, the documentary tries to hear out oil industry leaders and government insiders, whom more strident filmmakers might renounce or even goad. That is all for the good, not just for balance and not just because oil companies have helped PBS through the years, but also because these business and government types do know a few things worth knowing.</p>
        <p>For instance, the United States ambassador to Georgia, Richard Miles, explains the presence of American military trainers in that country: ''The primary purpose is to modernize the Georgian Army, and it does have a backup role, I would say, with regard to pipeline security.'' Or, he says, it's in the American strategic interest not to rely merely on Middle Eastern or, if it came to that, Russian oil and gas, ''so this is another source and therefore it's valuable.'' (One soldier on site had just explained that he was told to say they were somehow aiding the war on terror.)</p>
        <p>Panakh Guseinov, the former prime minister of Azerbaijan, goes on camera to recall how, after the Soviet Union splintered, the Caspian's underground assets were then considered freedom's prize. ''We saw the signing of the oil contracts as a guarantee of our independence,'' says Mr. Guseinov, who has been replaced by a head of state whose administration the narrator calls ''comically corrupt.'' But even in the heady days, there were special favors: priority was given to the British Petroleum Company, Mr. Guseinov said.</p>
        <p>Something does transpire between companies and politicians that seems at times criminal, at least in Angola, where oil multinationals have spent more than $4 billion that now cannot be tracked, the series reports. Faced with an impoverished populace, the Angolan minister of finance offers this explanation for the losses: ''Our capacity to administer is still very weak. There is no missing money whatsoever. This is accounting problems.''</p>
        <p>The series resorts to some visuals that seek to simplify the complicated disputes, but they veer toward the simplistic. In Ecuador a bat struggles to free its wings from iridescent sludge and looks a lot like 1991's CNN-hyped cormorants in the burning Kuwaiti oil fields. In Alaska a newborn caribou struggles to its hoofs and nuzzles its mother, which feels like a further Bambi-fication of wildlife debates. But these conflicts, especially the Alaskan fight to open a vast refuge, are essentially symbolic: oil companies want to drill in ecosystems preserved by law, and environmentalists do not want land protections undone.</p>
        <p>''The Amazing Race 5'' has engrossed its summer reality-TV devotees with American can-do contestants who will burn rubber toward any contrived tourist trap. This PBS all-terrain expedition has a similar drive (and soundtrack), but a larger, more edifying purpose.</p>
        <p>In places where oil springs from the ground, there really are noble indigenous tribes who get sick when their streams turn black, in this case the Huaoranis of Ecuador. There really are bands of bandits who occupy a Georgian no man's land and seem beyond the laws of any government. And the painful facts of a faulty, crucial resource are hard to refute when seen up close.</p>
