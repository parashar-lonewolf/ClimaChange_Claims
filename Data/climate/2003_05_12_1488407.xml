        <p>If trees had cocktail parties, the 40-year-old Callery pear that grows on Rivington Street, on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, could certainly hold its own.</p>
        <p>It might introduce itself by its formal name, Pyrus calleryana, and brag about its trunk diameter (25.4 inches), its height (24 feet) and its impressive shade canopy (1,746 square feet).</p>
        <p>If the tacky ''How much do you make?'' question came up, the pear tree could document its net worth at $1,192, and say that some of its earnings come from the 527.67 grams of pollutants it saves from human lungs every year, a value to society that economists put at $2.59. These figures would surely send the out-of-town trees fishing forlornly for the acorns in their martinis.</p>
        <p>Actually, these arboreal achievements are known because the pear tree was one of 322 New York City street trees included in a recent pilot project called the Neighborhood Tree Survey. The count, conducted by community and research organizations, examined trees from the South Bronx, the Lower East Side and northern Staten Island.</p>
        <p>Unlike many tree tallies, this one compiled extensive information with an ambitious goal some tree-huggers might consider crudely capitalistic: to break down each tree, its parts and its labor, into dollars and cents. Money has yet to grow on trees, but trees can provide crucial de-pollution services quantifiable in cold, hard cash.</p>
        <p>Most broadly, the survey concluded that the 322 trees had an average value of $3,225 per tree and a total value of $1,038,458. The value was said to be the amount the city would have to pay to replace the tree. The most expensive one, a 214-year-old tulip tree on Fillmore Street on Staten Island, came in at $23,069, while a scrawny 6-year-old ginkgo on Hunts Point Avenue in the South Bronx brought up the rear, at $54.</p>
        <p>''We hope that the price tags will help people realize the real value of street trees as assets and financial investments, as well as foster a sense of public stewardship,'' said Steven Romalewski, of the New York Public Interest Research Group, which helped run the survey.</p>
        <p>The survey broke down the monetary value of services the trees provided as pollution cleaners through natural respiration.</p>
        <p>For example, that Staten Island tulip tree scrubs $34.33 worth of pollutants per year from the air, the survey said. Researchers concluded that all trees in these areas removed $814,000 worth of pollution per year -- 143 tons kept from New York lungs.</p>
        <p>According to Mr. Romalewski, New Yorkers need to better acquaint themselves with their street trees, perhaps even care for them. In a city where nothing impresses like cash, the tree price tags help to put the introductions in a language New Yorkers understand. It also may be helpful in getting city government and private groups to invest in maintenance and planting.</p>
        <p>Though it did not participate in the survey, the Parks Department may use it as a model for its citywide tree survey planned for 2005, said Fiona S. Watt, the department's chief of forestry and horticulture. ''We'd like to see it replicated citywide,'' she said.</p>
        <p>''People always knew there was some vague benefit to trees, but you could never quantify it,'' Ms. Watt said. ''But once you have the methodology to equate trees with dollars, now you're talking. It's no longer about hugging trees because they're good, but because you have hard data in a language more effective in the public dialogue.''</p>
        <p>The city currently values its estimated 5 million trees at about $1,000 each and credits them with $9.5 million a year in antipollution benefits. But thousands of trees are lost to the city's peculiar stresses each year, including constant assault from pollution, vandalism, dog waste, poor soil in compacted spaces, lack of water and sunlight, and blows from cars and trucks.</p>
        <p>Faced with a dwindling tree population in the mid-1990's, the city has planted about 100,000 street trees since 1997 and has removed about 50,000 dead ones, Ms. Watt said. But smaller budgets have slowed this. The city allocated funds for 10,000 tree plantings in fiscal year 2003, compared with 19,000 plantings in 2000, she said. In dollars, the city has budgeted only $3.8 million for tree plantings in fiscal year 2004, compared with $7 million in 2003. The average cost of putting a tree in a sidewalk pit is $590.</p>
        <p>But a tree's fiscal worth is not easily quantified. Environmentalists have long argued that their value is far-reaching and often obscure. They cool the city, saving millions of dollars in air-conditioning bills. By buffering rainstorms, they prevent the need for larger, costlier storm-water runoff systems. Leafy blocks mean higher real estate prices and can draw shoppers to commercial areas. And then there are the many aesthetic intangibles. For example, what price a bird's song?</p>
        <p>''Trees are working hard for us every day, and this is giving a bit of recognition back to them,'' said Matthew Arnn, a landscape architect who directs the New York City Metro Initiative, a United States Forest Service program. ''Maybe with a real, hard dollar value on street trees, people will see them as more than just street furniture and that they can pay real dividends.''</p>
        <p>The Neighborhood Tree Survey organizers trained 29 volunteer citizen pruners to examine the trees and log the data on hand-held computers, for compilation in an online mapping system. For balance, organizers chose a lush suburban area on Staten Island, an area in the South Bronx, and a densely populated neighborhood in Lower Manhattan.</p>
        <p>They recorded tree dimensions like height and trunk diameter, and the amount of shade produced. From these, researchers calculated the less obvious categories, like the amount of sulfur dioxide each tree absorbs and how much isoprene it emits.</p>
        <p>''A healthy, growing tree is essentially a pollution-eating device and a mini air-conditioner,'' said David J. Nowak, a project leader for the Forest Service, an agency of the United States Department of Agriculture. According to Mr. Nowak, who helped analyze and calculate the data, a growing tree, as part of its respiration, takes in carbon dioxide and emits oxygen. It stores carbon and absorbs or catches other gaseous and particle pollution, including the carbon monoxide prevalent in vehicle exhaust, and nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide and ozone.</p>
        <p>American Forests, a Washington-based advocacy group, has done studies of other United States cities, calculating the values of urban trees. Its executive director, Deborah Gangloff, said that New York's Neighborhood Tree Survey numbers were not surprising.</p>
        <p>''The ecological value of America's urban forests are worth $4 billion annually, in terms of clean air and water,'' Ms. Gangloff said. ''A tree does more work for people in a city, so it's worth more in Manhattan. Then again, it's a tough place to be a tree.''</p>
