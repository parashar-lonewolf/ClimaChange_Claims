        <p>Housing is one of those emotional terms in the suburbs, like terrorism and global warming, that bring out a weird sort of anxious fatalism in people. Everyone knows that affordable housing is scarcer than ever, that counties like Westchester have become practically off limits to young people and the working class. The usual responses are passive acceptance or abject surrender: turning half of one's gross income over to a mortgage or moving to the Dakotas.</p>
        <p>But not everyone is giving up. A report in July by two nonprofit groups, the Citizens Housing and Planning Council and the Regional Plan Association, offers a big-picture dissection of the housing crisis that can leave a reader feeling not overwhelmed, but hopeful. While acknowledging that the housing situation poses a serious threat to the region's economy and quality of life, and that things have become worse in recent years, the report, ''Balanced Housing for a Smart Region'' (available at chpcny.org or rpa.org), is bursting with strategies and tactics for attacking the problem on multiple fronts.</p>

        <p>Housing is one of those emotional terms in the suburbs, like terrorism and global warming, that bring out a weird sort of anxious fatalism in people. Everyone knows that affordable housing is scarcer than ever, that counties like Westchester have become practically off limits to young people and the working class. The usual responses are passive acceptance or abject surrender: turning half of one's gross income over to a mortgage or moving to the Dakotas.</p>
        <p>But not everyone is giving up. A report in July by two nonprofit groups, the Citizens Housing and Planning Council and the Regional Plan Association, offers a big-picture dissection of the housing crisis that can leave a reader feeling not overwhelmed, but hopeful. While acknowledging that the housing situation poses a serious threat to the region's economy and quality of life, and that things have become worse in recent years, the report, ''Balanced Housing for a Smart Region'' (available at chpcny.org or rpa.org), is bursting with strategies and tactics for attacking the problem on multiple fronts.</p>
        <p>There has been no shortage, of course, of housing prescriptions that are optimistic, ambitious and ineffectual. Every politician has a few. But this report, singular for its depth and completeness, lays out a host of ways to overcome the shortsightedness and not-in-my-backyard intransigence that has kept solutions at bay.</p>
        <p>The report is also notable for the sound strategic principles that inform it (and that could well inform developers and political leaders), among them the following:</p>
        <p>Sprawl is not an option. The New York metropolitan region will need to create housing for an estimated three million to four million people in the next 25 years, but this time there will be no Robert Moses to lead the multitudes into the promised land, because there is no such place.</p>
        <p>Yes, parts of the Hudson Valley, eastern Long Island, the far reaches of New Jersey and the nearer precincts of Pennsylvania still have room left for traditional single-family homes on suburban-style lots. But this region's commutes are already the longest in the country, and there is a limit to how far people can drive and how much bulldozing of open space they will tolerate. Throughout the region, there is growing pressure to preserve what is left of its forests and farmland, and the age of buildout seems nearly at hand.</p>
        <p>The good news is that the region is rich in poor cities -- Yonkers is an excellent example -- as well as empty industrial sites, desolate shopping malls and other underused properties that are ripe for redevelopment and repopulation. In a housing-hungry era, things that are generally regarded as blight should be regarded as positive resources; today's brownfield can be tomorrow's rejuvenated and repopulated neighborhood.</p>
        <p>'High-density' is not a dirty word. And neither is ''affordable housing.'' Communities throughout the region have long opposed the obvious answer to housing shortages, which is to build more apartment buildings and other forms of multifamily housing for people with low and moderate incomes.</p>
        <p>Some of the resistance comes from plain old white-flight racism, but it also stems from the not-unreasonable belief that newcomers with children burden the schools and end up costing a community more than they pay in taxes. The report concedes that, but points out that not every household has children. A smart mix of new housing -- serving the elderly, divorced singles and childless couples, as well as growing young families -- can help, not hurt, a community's fiscal bottom line.</p>
        <p>Old perceptions die out slowly, but there also seems to be a growing realization in the suburbs that ''those people'' who would take garden apartments near single-family split-ranches are not just refugees from the city, but the children of suburbanites -- including teachers, police officers, firefighters and the other members of the middle and working classes who are vital to the life of any community. It is telling that in Westchester, the nonprofit group Habitat for Humanity is building homes not just for the poor, but also for volunteer firefighters.</p>
        <p>Smart is better than dumb. The philosophy of ''smart growth'' has come to be seen by many as a precious architectural conceit, a recipe for tidy pastel homes with gables and picket fences. But the concept is richer and more vital than that. It encompasses walkable communities, ready access to mass transit, and architecture that is dense and compact but attractively built.</p>
        <p>If the region is ever going to break its addiction to the car, the curse of low-density sprawl and traffic congestion, communities arranged on smart-growth principles will lead the way. Their appealing design is usually a plus, and is considered a major factor in increasing the public's acceptance of new multifamily construction, which often looks better than the aging, old-style suburban homes around it.</p>
        <p>New York is not Phoenix. And thank goodness for that. This region is distinctive for having every conceivable mix of housing types, from ''Brady Bunch'' ranches to SoHo lofts to creaky riverfront Victorians. The cultural richness and diversity of the region presents planners and developers with lots of options. Here in Westchester, to take one particularly creative example, Thomas Schwarz, president of Purchase College of the State University of New York, has pushed a plan to build apartments for the elderly on the sprawling campus, an excellent idea that has died several times in Albany.</p>
        <p>Big government is not the problem. Little government is. Hundreds of local municipalities control decisions about land use, and their individual acts of resistance to housing solutions have left the whole region worse off. States cannot rely on the bully pulpit; they need broad strategies for planning and managing growth. The report holds up New Jersey's plan as one of the most comprehensive in the nation, while noting that Connecticut's is purely advisory, and New York's is nonexistent.</p>
        <p>Westchester's exclusive enclaves tend to be unabashed in their resistance to letting down the housing ladder to the nonrich. But there are also examples of real leadership. The Town of Greenburgh long ago instituted an ''inclusionary zoning'' rule requiring that 10 percent of new multifamily housing units be affordable. The county government has worked hard to promote such housing, with legal, financial and technical help to developers, agencies and local governments that want to do what is right.</p>
        <p>More radically and profoundly, the report says, states can help by breaking the link between school financing and property taxes, a huge barrier to the creation of new multifamily and affordable housing. The state of Michigan has done so, replacing property taxes with a grab bag of revenues from other sources and thereby eliminating at least one local rationale for opposing affordable housing.</p>
        <p>There are other things state and county governments can do. They can give tax breaks to companies that build housing for their employees, provide money to nonprofit groups to preserve housing, create housing trust funds that can be used to build mixed-income housing and make creative use of development rights, allowing developers to build in greater density in return for preserving open space.</p>
        <p>We're all in this together. The report stresses that the region's far-flung suburbs are all extremities of one social and economic organism. Solutions in one area will help communities in another. The region is large, sprawling and full of competing interests and rivalries, but affordable housing is the quandary that unites us all.</p>
