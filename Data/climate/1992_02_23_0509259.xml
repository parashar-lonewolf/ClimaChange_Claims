        <p>Is it reopening time in the gardens of the West? So you would think, to judge from the recent blossoming of books, conferences and exhibitions on the subject of landscape design.Through Friday, the Urban Center, on Madison Avenue between 50th and 51st Streets, presents "New Park: New Ideas," a show of 20 landscape designs by students at City College, Harvard, Parsons School of Design, the University of Virginia and Yale. The designs, though wonderfully various, were all conceived for a single site: the 21-acre plot where a park is being planned for Riverside South, the complex under development by Donald Trump on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Sponsored by the Municipal Art Society with support from the Greenacre Foundation, "New Park: New Ideas" is an important show, not least because, as a display of student work, it offers a peek over the design horizon. The prospect shows great promise. It's indicative of renewed idealism that studios in five design schools chose to focus on this site, a meeting ground for the critical issues of public space and environmental conservation. The students have risen to the level of the project's ambitious intentions. Overall, these designs are refreshingly free from formula: no modernoid lunar landscapes with lollipop light bulbs, no "Olmstoid" caricatures of Frederick Law Olmsted's pioneering work of a century ago. Collectively, the students grasp that what the city needs is not only more green, open space but also more fertile imagination.</p>

        <p>Is it reopening time in the gardens of the West? So you would think, to judge from the recent blossoming of books, conferences and exhibitions on the subject of landscape design.Through Friday, the Urban Center, on Madison Avenue between 50th and 51st Streets, presents "New Park: New Ideas," a show of 20 landscape designs by students at City College, Harvard, Parsons School of Design, the University of Virginia and Yale. The designs, though wonderfully various, were all conceived for a single site: the 21-acre plot where a park is being planned for Riverside South, the complex under development by Donald Trump on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Sponsored by the Municipal Art Society with support from the Greenacre Foundation, "New Park: New Ideas" is an important show, not least because, as a display of student work, it offers a peek over the design horizon. The prospect shows great promise. It's indicative of renewed idealism that studios in five design schools chose to focus on this site, a meeting ground for the critical issues of public space and environmental conservation. The students have risen to the level of the project's ambitious intentions. Overall, these designs are refreshingly free from formula: no modernoid lunar landscapes with lollipop light bulbs, no "Olmstoid" caricatures of Frederick Law Olmsted's pioneering work of a century ago. Collectively, the students grasp that what the city needs is not only more green, open space but also more fertile imagination.</p>
        <p>Though one of the show's strengths is the enormous diversity of ideas, a number of projects have themes in common. Designs by Alison T. Cook and Peter O'Shea are among many that propose to restore ecological balance by returning at least part of the site to its former condition as a tidal salt marsh. Other schemes assert that technology can be environmentally beneficial; the most beautiful of these is Goojin Hwang's lyrical "Wind City," a grove of 40 windmills that would generate power to illuminate the park at night. Miles Mazzei and Linda Lawton seek poetry in archeology by incorporating into their designs fragments from the old Miller Highway and the dilapidated Hudson River piers adjacent to the site.</p>
        <p>Alas, that decaying infrastructure is not the only decrepit aspect of this show. Indeed, for all their freshness and variety, these new ideas remain rooted in the same old unexamined one: the idea that parks are, above all, a form of visual art. Perhaps the show's greatest service is to provoke reflection on the limits of that idea.</p>
        <p>Landscape is a visual concept; it marks the conversion of land into imagery. We owe that conversion to the Renaissance architects who turned farmlands into scenic backdrops for Italian villas, in effect transforming agriculture into visual culture. That achievement initiated a prodigious legacy: parks and gardens that have immeasurably enriched urban life. As Monique Mosser and Georges Teyssot write in their 1991 work "The Architecture of Western Gardens," "The garden may be seen as the highest form of agriculture." And what could be more civilized than a scale of values that prizes beauty over mere survival?</p>
        <p>Still, that scale rests on the assumption that beauty can flower because survival has been taken care of. Reports from the ozone layer suggest that we don't have these priorities in order. Obviously, parks are not major polluters. But they are symbols of our determination to master nature with little regard for the consequences. A park's beauty can seduce us into thinking we are celebrating nature when in fact we are denaturing it -- prizing it chiefly for its scenic appeal. Parks, gardens, even suburban lawns set forth relationships between nature and culture; and who, pondering the befouled condition of the planet, can doubt that our relationship to nature urgently needs to be redefined? That's the opportunity parks offer us today.</p>
        <p>The young designers whose work is on view at the Urban Center are by no means oblivious to environmental issues. The salt marshes, windmills and wild grasses are all signs of their awareness that what matters is not only how nature looks but how it works. The problem is that we have no way of assessing the ecological value of these signs. Nowhere does the show tell us whether, or to what extent, the students' inventions would perform as natural systems. And without that information, we are not equipped to judge the results except on visual terms. Indeed, we are left with the message that visual terms are the only criteria that count. That's a dubious message to be sending at a time when consumers are warned not to be bamboozled by "green" packaging.</p>
        <p>The point is not that artists should become ecologists, much less be replaced by them, or that parks should resemble compost heaps or recycling depots. The challenge, rather, is to forge a partnership between artists and environmentalists so that, together, they can produce new forms that draw on the strengths of each discipline. Environmentalists should not be relegated to the role of mere technicians, called in at the end of the design process to implement an artist's vision. They should participate throughout, not just to guard against environmental abuse but to unlock new possibilities for beauty. Otherwise -- as with Jennifer Bartlett's now-defunct garden design for Battery Park City -- we're stuck with an outmoded Romantic stereotype of the artist as an omniscient sage, innately attuned to nature's harmonies.</p>
        <p>Clearly, one exhibition can't overturn a hierarchy that has been in place for centuries. Still, it is disappointing that "New Park: New Ideas" didn't take the opportunity to rethink the status quo. A show, too, can propose a new relationship between nature and culture. What better place to plant the seeds than a show devoted to the generation now coming into flower?</p>
