        <p>ALBANY, Jan. 4 - All right, so Gov. George E.

        <p>All right, so Gov. George E. Pataki did not use his State of the State address to issue any dramatic calls to keep New Hampshire the home of the first presidential primary -- an issue dear to the hearts of some of the New Hampshire voters he has been courting as he explores a run for president in 2008.</p>
        <p>But there was plenty in Governor Pataki's 12th and last address to the New York Legislature to suggest that he was speaking, at least in part, to an audience outside of New York.</p>
        <p>The governor made a pitch for ethanol, an alternative fuel made from corn that is beloved in Iowa, which happens to also be the home of the first presidential caucus, and, judging by Governor Pataki's travel schedule, his new favorite state outside of New York.</p>
        <p>He railed against New York's estate tax and the ''marriage penalty'' in its tax code -- two taxes on the national level long the bane of Republicans. And he spoke of his belief in what he called ''active but limited government.''</p>
        <p>The speech Governor Pataki used to begin his lame-duck year was sprinkled with just enough hints to fuel speculation that even though he hardly registers in early polls of potential Republican presidential contenders, he is still very much considering a run for president in 2008. (Last summer, facing poor poll numbers at home, the governor announced that he would not seek re-election to a fourth term.)</p>
        <p>Some political analysts believe that Mr. Pataki's past support for gay rights, gun control, environmental regulations and spending increases could make it very hard for him to win in a Republican presidential primary, in which voters tend to be more conservative.</p>
        <p>But Republican and Democratic lawmakers who sat in the ornate Assembly chamber on Wednesday to hear his speech said they were struck by the fact that the governor did not make more of an effort to reinvent himself by tacking to the right.</p>
        <p>Instead of quoting a Republican icon like Ronald Reagan, the governor quoted John F. Kennedy.</p>
        <p>Governor Pataki took credit for leading the way to create a regional program to limit the emissions of greenhouse gases in the Northeast -- even though his efforts to do so have come under fire from the right. And, in calling for elimination of the estate tax, Governor Pataki shunned the more politically charged phrase, ''death tax,'' which many other Republicans have used.</p>
        <p>Finally, in trying to describe his own credo, he did not exactly align himself with those who believe that government is the problem, not the solution.</p>
        <p>''I believe in active but limited government,'' Mr. Pataki said. ''A government that is engaged and effective but never intrusive or overreaching: a government that works vigorously and diligently to identify problems and then creates opportunities for people to solve them, a government that staunchly protects its citizens' freedom to live, work and raise their families yet never dictates how they should do so.''</p>
        <p>Some Democrats said the governor's tone was welcome after two years in which he appeared to be positioning himself to the right, with his veto of a rise in the state's minimum wage (which was overridden) and his veto of legislation that would have allowed women to get emergency contraceptives without a prescription (which was not).</p>
        <p>State Senator Eric T. Schneiderman, a Manhattan Democrat who often criticizes the governor, said he was pleasantly surprised. ''There were a lot of us who thought he was going to veer more sharply to the right today,'' he said.</p>
        <p>It was an unusual State of the State day. Instead of looking for clues about the forthcoming legislative session, many lawmakers and lobbyists here found themselves trying to figure out more about the governor's plans, and how he might position himself for a national race.</p>
        <p>''I don't know if there's any mystery,'' said Senator Joseph L. Bruno, the Republican majority leader. ''The governor, presently, doesn't represent Iowa or New Hampshire, but he's been there a number of times.''</p>
        <p>Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Democrat, faulted the governor for seeking tax cuts instead of trying to comply with a court order requiring the state to spend billions of dollars more on New York City's schools.</p>
        <p>''Some of his tax cuts are geared not to the working men and women of New York necessarily,'' he said, ''but are geared toward the many Republican primary voters who have so much, and need so little from government.''</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Pataki has spoken of ethanol in past addresses to the Legislature, his mention of it on Wednesday, combined with his recent trips to Iowa, spurred much talk. Peverill Squire, a professor of political science at the University of Iowa, said the line about ethanol ''is probably more popular in Iowa than New York.''</p>
        <p>''I suspect he probably won't be alone in singing that tune,'' Professor Squire said. ''Most farmers here are Republican, and it's a good constituency to address.''</p>
        <p>But one political aspirant who chose to take the governor's words at face value was Andrew M. Cuomo, who is running for attorney general.</p>
        <p>''I've heard a lot of political suspicion read into a lot of governors' comments,'' he said, perhaps thinking of his father, Mario M. Cuomo. ''And this is an issue for this state also. So I don't want to look anywhere beyond the apparent meaning of the governor's words.''</p>
