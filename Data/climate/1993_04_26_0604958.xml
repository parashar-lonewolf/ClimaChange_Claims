        <p>Bacteria that kill insects have been found in tombs of mummies in ancient Egypt. Their presence in the soil has killed mosquitoes in the Middle East, beetles in northern Europe and silkworms in Asia. And for the last decade, scientists have engineered them to kill specific bugs that threaten food crops and agricultural products like cotton.</p>
        <p>A naturally occurring bacteria gene called Bacillus thuringiensis, or Bt, has helped revolutionize insecticide manufacturing by replacing chemicals with biological insect-slayers. Now a Pennsylvania company hopes a new biopesticide patent based on Bt's will help eradicate this country's corn rootworm menace.</p>
        <p>The rootworm costs growers $140 million to $150 million a year to control, the Department of Agriculture estimates. Today, most farmers use chemical pesticides, which can be environmentally hazardous. The rootworm can also adapt to chemicals, making more potent pesticides necessary.</p>
        <p>Ecogen Inc., an agricultural biotechnology company in Langhorne, Pa., already holds several bioinsecticide patents. Now the company has manipulated Bt genes to create a new strain that targets the corn rootworm.  Field Tests Ahead</p>
        <p>Ecogen's chairman, Jack Davies, explained that the bacteria have the ability to create a protein near the end of their life cycle. When bugs eat the bacteria, he said, "that protein appears to attach itself to certain receptor sites in certain insects," setting into motion a process that basically starves the insect to death.</p>
        <p>Ecogen still has to conduct field tests of its new product, in part to determine its most efficient potency. But the company already believes the bioinsecticide is safe for people.</p>
        <p>"We as humans don't have these receptor sites," Mr. Davies said. "Birds, fish and other mammals don't have them. So the Bt's are only toxic to certain insects."</p>
        <p>Ecogen's patent is 5,187,091. 'Ozone Friendly' Correction Fluid</p>
        <p>Every time a secretary, a college student or a sloppy executive unscrews the cap of an ordinary container of typewriter correction fluid, minute amounts of ozone-depleting solvents escape.</p>
        <p>Now the Gillette Company has a new patent for an "ozone friendly correction fluid" for its Liquid Paper.</p>
        <p>The original recipe for correction fluid had to bond to paper but still be flexible. It also couldn't smear, had to dry quickly and had to have a dispersing agent so it wouldn't harden if it sat around unused for a while. But one ingredient was the carrying agent for all the chemicals that performed those functions -- a volatile halogenated hydrocarbon solvent.</p>
        <p>In the past, that halogenated solvent was typically trichloro ethane, "which has been shown to deplete the ozone layer," said Chiou C. Yau, a program chemist at Gillette. As a result, Gillette has substituted a non-halogenated chemical called cyclohexane as a carrying agent in its new correction fluid. Its patent is 5,199,976. At 12, He's Building A Better Milk Jug</p>
        <p>Three teams of inventors sat on a Washington dais earlier this month, waiting to be honored by the Intellectual Property Owners Association as Inventors of the Year. A beaming group of executives from the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company was being honored for a new tire. Next to them, proud scientists from Merck &amp; Company were getting an award for a new prostrate drug. At the end of the table, the last inventor waited in a blue suit and tie, his hair slicked down.</p>
        <p>He was probably the most grateful to be there because he got the day off from school. He was 12.</p>
        <p>In front of Akhil Rastogi was his invention -- a plastic milk jug with a crudely shaped clay spout. The basic jug had a familiar look -- it was exactly the kind of grocery-store milk container that had exasperated him at age 7 and had made him think "there has to be a better way to do this."</p>
        <p>"My mother had a wrist injury and she couldn't pour the milk," said Akhil, recalling how he discovered that the plastic gallon jugs with the center lid were "too heavy for me, and I'd spill the milk as I poured it."</p>
        <p>So the boy took some clay and a plastic jug and begin molding a tear-drop-shaped spout to make the milk flow straight into his glass.</p>
        <p>"I took the jug neck and poked a hole in the clay so it would be the exact size," he said, "and then I raised the walls of the spout and lowered the middle so the milk would flow down the center." He dubbed the creation "E-Z Gallon," and, with his father's help, applied for a patent. He was 10 at the time.</p>
        <p>Akhil, a sixth grader from Fairfax, Va., is now looking for a backer to finance a plastic prototype of the spout. His design patent is 329,810.</p>
        <p>Patents are available by number for $3 from the Patent and Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.</p>
