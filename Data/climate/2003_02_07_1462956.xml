        <p>Besides sifting debris and data, investigators seeking to understand what destroyed the space shuttle Columbia are using powerful computers and wind-tunnel models to simulate the doomed craft and the forces at play as it hurtled toward earth.</p>
        <p>Simulations are now used for a multitude of things like designing car engines and comprehending global warming, and they have played a role in seeking the causes of airline disasters. But independent experts were divided yesterday on whether NASA, after years of strained budgets and shifting focus, was up to the task of using modeling to figure out what brought the Columbia down.</p>
        <p>The task is particularly daunting, the space agency and outside experts said, because of the extreme conditions the shuttle encountered as it left frictionless space and entered the outermost atmosphere.</p>
        <p>One goal of the modeling process is to identify possible problems -- a certain amount of damage to a certain number of tiles, for example -- that could explain why the Columbia's left wing started to dip and its reaction-control rockets failed to hold its position.</p>
        <p>Other models are being used to figure out how heat might have moved through the aluminum frame or hydraulic system even though only a few of the dozens of temperature sensors aboard showed warming and almost all the others did not.</p>
        <p>''Modeling is going to be critical in determining what the root cause eventually was,'' said Dr. Brian J. Cantwell, a professor of aeronautics and astronautics at Stanford Universitys who did research for NASA during the Apollo program.</p>
        <p>Some experts said yesterday that NASA's simulations of the shuttle were among the best efforts ever to devise numerical formulas, or codes, that mimic the real world.</p>
        <p>NASA's main strength, they said, is having 111 previous full flights of the shuttle, each of which was a test case -- recorded in masses of data -- that could be held up against the simulation to see how it imitated actual vagaries.</p>
        <p>''My sense is that the shuttle simulations are among the most verified codes in computational engineering,'' said Dr. Larry Smarr, an expert on advanced computer simulation who is a computer science professor at the University of California at San Diego.</p>
        <p>But other experts, including some with long experience in the shuttle program, expressed strong doubts. Among the skeptics was Allan J. McDonald, who retired a year and a half ago as vice president for advanced programs and technology at Thiokol, maker of the shuttle's booster rockets.</p>
        <p>Mr. McDonald was one of the Thiokol engineers who, 17 years ago, argued that it was too cold to launch the Challenger, was overruled and -- after the explosion -- oversaw the redesign of the flawed boosters. The Columbia disaster, he said, may turn out to be rooted in a different kind of negligence -- a failure not just to model but also to do physical testing to validate models.</p>
        <p>He cited the theory that a chunk of insulation that flew off the shuttle's 15-story external fuel tank and hit the shuttle's left wing may have caused enough damage to doom it. NASA, he said, cannot analyze the threat realistically, because although it modeled the possibility it did not do physical laboratory tests to prove that foam at high speeds could harm tiles.</p>
        <p>''They give you a far better idea of the possible damage and let you make real judgments,'' he said. Nobody at NASA, he added, did that, partly because of the lack of money for gathering the data in wind-tunnel tests.</p>
        <p>''They've done probably as good as they could do with what they were given,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Last night, NASA computer engineers at research hubs in California and Virginia said they were working around the clock to prove the doubters wrong.</p>
        <p>A senior engineer at the Langley Research Center in Virginia, speaking on the condition of anonymity, emphasized that the ultimate test of the models had been the actual flights, which have shown that the models work.</p>
        <p>''The existing library of data has given a very high degree of confidence that we can accurately predict the heating and aerodynamic performance on reentry,'' the engineer said.</p>
        <p>Without discussing details of the current investigation, other engineers said they had a host of powerful tools to contribute to the inquiry: both computer models and high-speed wind tunnels in which shuttle models can be put through innumerable test cases.</p>
        <p>The Ames Research Center at Moffett Field in California also has a simulator of the shuttle cockpit that can be used to replay flights and assess how tiny changes in conditions might affect the outcome.</p>
        <p>At Langley, wind tunnels will be used to recreate the conditions experienced by the Columbia in its last moments. A physical miniature of a shuttle in an actual stream of gas is still better than a computer at replicating conditions at 18 times the speed of sound, engineers there said.</p>
