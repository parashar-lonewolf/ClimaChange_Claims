        <p>LEAD: ABAN against fishing for striped bass in New Jersey's marine waters will begin April 1 unless the state comes up with more restrictive length limits for the species before that date.</p>
        <p>ABAN against fishing for striped bass in New Jersey's marine waters will begin April 1 unless the state comes up with more restrictive length limits for the species before that date.</p>
        <p>The moratorium would be imposed by the United States Interior Department and Commerce Department under the provisions of the Atlantic Striped Bass Conservation Act. The act requires the coastal states from Maine to North Carolina to implement the interstate management plan for the fish set forth by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission. It aims at restoring dwindling stocks of the coast's migratory stripers, of which an estimated 75 to 90 percent - when all is well with the species in the region - are spawned in the rivers entering Chesapeake Bay.</p>
        <p>The causes of the decline of striped bass production in the Chesapeake include various forms of pollution -acid rain undoubtedly among them -and over-fishing by both sport and commercial interests. The only immediate course open to those striving to rebuild populations of the species is to reduce dramatically man's harvesting of them.</p>
        <p>When discussing striper spawning success, fisheries biologists refer to ''dominant year classes,'' years in which many mature females return to their traditional spawning grounds with large numbers of their resulting progeny surviving through the larval and fingerling stage. There was such a year class in 1982 in the Chesapeake, although it did not come close to matching the contributions of some earlier years. It is the female survivors of the Chesapeake's 1982 year class - about 20 percent of which began spawning in the spring of 1986 - and all year classes thereafter that the ever-stiffening regulations are intended to protect. For the coming season, the Federal agencies are calling for a minimum-length limit of at least 31 inches to go into effect immediately and to be raised to 33 inches by Aug. 1.</p>
        <p>Unlike the procedure in some states, New York among them, New Jersey's Department of Environmental Protection does not set regulations for striped bass in salt water, the State Legislature having retained that authority.</p>
        <p>Under New Jersey's existing regulations for striped bass in marine waters, the fish may be taken only by rod and reel or by a diver with a spear gun. The state's present daily creel limit is five stripers, all of which must be at least 24 inches long. According to Bruce Freeman of the D.E.P.'s marine section, the state had earlier this year failed to persuade Interior and Commerce that new regulations contained in a bill pending in the state legislature would meet the requirements. An early version of that bill - its prime sponsor is State Sen. Frank Pallone, Democrat of Monmouth County - divided the state's coastline into two regions, one north of Barnegat Inlet, one south of it, and called for a daily limit of two fish at least 33 inches long in the southern zone and a three-fish limit in the northern zone, two of them at least 33 inches long and the third between 18 and 24 inches.</p>
        <p>The reasoning behind this was that a 1985 study revealed that most of the stripers caught from Barnegat Inlet north in that year were from the Hudson River. Although many are heavily laden with PCB's (polychlorinated biphenyls), the Hudson's stripers continue to reproduce at a healthy pace. Of the 10,000 stripers caught along the entire New Jersey coast in 1985, about 9,500 were taken from Barnegat north. The average weight of the 10,000 fish was 10 pounds and the average length between 29 and 30 inches. The 500 stripers caught south of Barnegat were much larger, more than half over 33 inches long.</p>
        <p>It was obvious that the proposed two-zone regulations would result in the capture of only a few Chesapeake Bay female stripers spawned from 1982 on, but the intent of the interstate management plan for the species is that there be no fishery directed against any of them, and because of this New Jersey's proposal as embodied in the Pallone bill was rejected.</p>
        <p>Until a few days ago, striped bass could be bought and sold in New Jersey, but that is no longer legal. The reason for this is that PCB levels in half or more of the stripers taken from the state's waters are above the minimum deemed fit for human consumption by the Food and Drug Administration. The same PCB concentrations resulted in New York State's ban, which began in 1986, on the sale or possession of stripers.</p>
        <p>The New Jersey ban differs from New York's in that it leaves room for the taking of stripers for home consumption. This will be academic, of course, unless the necessary length-limit regulations are forthcoming from the New Jersey Legislature. The New York ban continues, but the state's Department of Environmental Conservation is proposing that it be eased to allow the taking of one fish - at least 33 inches long - a day by recreational anglers.</p>
        <p>The 31- and 33-inch length limits -which Interior and Commerce have made clear is what is wanted - have not been pulled out of the air. Freeman explained that while 95 percent of the female stripers spawned in 1982 are now probably between 23 and 26 inches long, the remaining 5 percent are in excess of 31 inches.</p>
        <p>A high percentage of male stripers spawn by age 2, and by age 3 perhaps 99.9 per cent will have done so. By age 3, only 25 to 30 percent of the females are ready to spawn, and some will take as long as 6 years to accomplish this.</p>
        <p>Last spring, it appeared that about 20 percent of the female stripers on the Chesapeake Bay spawning grounds came from the 1982 year class. It is estimated that by the spring of 1988 they will constitute 99 percent of the Bay's spawners.</p>
        <p>Although a great many eggs and larvae may be produced in a given year, there is no assurance that they will mature. That is why fisheries biologists use a so-called ''young of the year index'' to measure spawning success, which involves a survey estimate of the numbers of young stripers that survive into fall, after which the mortality rate is much less and can be projected with reasonable accuracy.</p>
        <p>The effort going into protecting the 1982 year class, may, Freeman said, ''be our last hope. . . . All we can do is wait.''  OUTDOORS</p>
