        <p>The U.S. base in the Philippines was defended by President Corazon C. Aquino, who called for a popular vote on whether to extend the naval station's lease. The vote is a last-ditch effort to work around the opposition in the Philippine Senate. Page A1</p>
        <p>News analysis: Secretary Baker displayed a keen interest in economic issues during his trip to the Soviet Union reflecting the conclusion of American officials that economic improvement is needed to sustain recent reforms. A1</p>
        <p>A rural Soviet town is slow to learn of tumultuous events in the "center," that remote place -- organizationally if not geographically -- where governments are formed and polices are made. Even when a coup occurs, the main effect on the populace is which portrait is hung on the wall. A12</p>
        <p>U.S. weighs aid to the Soviet military A12</p>

        <p>The scandal surrounding B.C.C.I. is raising questions about the performance of the bank's auditor, Price Waterhouse. Although auditors wrote to the directors of the troubled bank about questionable transactions, weeks later they signed the bank's annual report for 1989. A1</p>
        <p>Life insurance companies are considering the establishment of a giant emergency fund, financed by the companies themselves, which could provide assistance to insurers with short-term cash troubles. D1</p>
        <p>NASA is trimming its sails. In an effort that could save billions of dollars, the space agency is shelving plans for large spacecraft in favor of relatively small and simple ones. A1</p>

        <p>Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa roared into the race for the Democratic Presidential nomination and in his announcement said the election would offer a stark choice between government for the privileged and government for the people. B8</p>
        <p>Mississippi's Governor, Ray Mabus, was elected by proclaiming that the state "will never be last again." But as he runs for re-election, his achievements have been mixed -- education reform was approved by the Legislature but financing was not. B8</p>
        <p>A homeless woman's sizeable estate, left to a Massachusetts legislator and his aide in gratitude for their assistance, has become a political liability for that legislator. The legislator is being investigated by state and Federal officials and some say accepting the $500,000 gift was wrong. A14</p>
