        <p>A visibly incensed Bill Bradley lashed into Vice President Al Gore for turning sharply negative in recent days, accusing him of resorting to ''outrageous scare tactics'' in criticizing Mr. Bradley's plan for universal health care.</p>
        <p>Straying from his typically even-tempered manner, Mr. Bradley appeared red-faced and almost speechless with anger during a news conference he called to rebut accusations by Mr. Gore, printed today in The San Francisco Chronicle, that Mr. Bradley's health care plan would deprive people with H.I.V. and AIDS of health coverage.</p>
        <p>''This is just another example of a kind of meanness in politics that is fundamentally destructive of an open dialogue on issues,'' said Mr. Bradley, who was flanked by several leaders of gay and lesbian groups in San Francisco. ''It was the worst use of scare tactics that I had seen in many years.''</p>
        <p>He added that Mr. Gore's latest attack ''made my blood boil.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bradley's outburst came two days after Mr. Gore used a speech before a convention of the California Democratic Party to return to the harshly negative attacks on Mr. Bradley's campaign agenda and character that he had first used much earlier in the campaign.</p>
        <p>During that speech, Mr. Gore asserted that Mr. Bradley had ''attacked and demeaned'' the Democratic Party by criticizing the Clinton administration. Mr. Bradley, by contrast, had refrained from making his harshest attacks on Mr. Gore in his convention speech.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore said Mr. Bradley's plan would hurt poor people with H.I.V. because it called for abolishing Medicaid, the government health care program for the poor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bradley says his plan would call for current Medicaid recipients to receive coverage under the system of private insurance that now covers federal employees, which he contends would be superior to Medicaid.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, who delivered education speeches today in Rochester and Brooklyn and attended a fund-raiser in Manhattan tonight, did not respond himself to Mr. Bradley's accusations. But Mr. Gore's press secretary, Chris Lehane, said, ''Bradley's health plan would replace Medicaid with a $150 monthly voucher, which will not begin to cover the many services required by people with H.I.V./AIDS.''</p>
        <p>''Senator Bradley has had six months to refute Al Gore's challenges on the merits,'' he said, ''and he has been unable to do so.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bradley had begun the day with a speech at the Sierra Club in downtown San Francisco in which he assailed Mr. Gore's record on the environment, accusing him of conducting policy by photo opportunity and repeatedly failing to protect sensitive ecosystems.</p>
        <p>Sharply hitting Mr. Gore on one of his strongest issues, Mr. Bradley ticked off a list of promises Mr. Gore had made before the 1992 election that the administration had failed to honor.</p>
        <p>''The administration has been long on promise and short on action,'' Mr. Bradley said. ''To be a custodian of the natural world means more than paddling a kayak for TV cameras.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bradley was referring to a campaign event last summer where Mr. Gore paddled a canoe down the Connecticut River in New Hampshire. It was later reported that a local power company had released millions of gallons of water into the river during a drought to ease Mr. Gore's trip.</p>
        <p>Appearing with Mr. Bradley today was Brent Blackwelder, president of the Friends of the Earth, a small national environmental group that has endorsed Mr. Bradley, and Stewart Udall, a former secretary of the interior for Presidents Kennedy and Johnson in the 1960's.</p>
        <p>The Sierra Club and other national environmental groups have so far stayed neutral in the race.</p>
        <p>Though Mr. Gore, who has written a book on global warming, was considered a strong advocate for the environment before 1993, many environmentalists have expressed disappointment with the administration's environmental record over the last seven years. And Mr. Bradley was clearly trying to stoke that dissatisfaction today.</p>
        <p>The insurgent got the loudest applause from the crowd of 150 people when he attacked the administration's recent decision to extend 36 off-shore drilling leases along the California coast. Mr. Bradley has criticized Mr. Gore for not fighting within the administration to block the extensions.</p>
        <p>''The vice president's silence is loud and clear,'' Mr. Bradley said. ''And if he hasn't fulfilled the promises he made in 1992, why should we believe the promises he's making today?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bradley also asserted that the administration has bent environmental rules to help big campaign contributors. He cited a case in which the administration backed the construction of a shopping mall in the environmentally sensitive New Jersey meadowlands. The developer was a major contributor to Mr. Gore's campaign.</p>
        <p>''We have to rid our political system of the taint of political money, just as we rid our world of the stain of pollution,'' Mr. Bradley said. ''I don't think it's acceptable that we sacrifice protection of our natural world to campaign fund-raising.''</p>
        <p>Douglas Hattaway, a spokesman  for Mr. Gore, said, ''Attacking Al Gore on the environment is like taking on Bill Bradley over basketball. This administration is the most pro-environment in a generation thanks to Al Gore.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bradley used his speech to outline a concept he calls ''the land ark,'' which would use federal funds to create protected habitats for endangered species on federally owned land.</p>
        <p>He also said he would ban all off-shore drilling along the California and Florida seashores, expand federal programs intended to conserve privately owned land and cut subsidies for mining, oil exploration and livestock grazing on federal land.</p>
        <p>Polls show Mr. Bradley trailing Mr. Gore by a substantial margin in California, which holds its primary on March 7 along with about a dozen other states, including New York.</p>
        <p>His aides said Mr. Bradley believes he must win, or at least stay very close to Mr. Gore here, to keep his underdog campaign alive. To that end he is likely to spend part of every week in California until March 7.  THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE DEMOCRATS</p>
