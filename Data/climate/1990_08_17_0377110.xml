        <p>LEAD: DAVID LYNCH'S work is all a matter of disorienting scale, of emphases that are out of kilter. The same object can as easily be the surface of the moon, seen in a long shot, or a shriveled, pock-marked basketball photographed in close-up.</p>
        <p>DAVID LYNCH'S work is all a matter of disorienting scale, of emphases that are out of kilter. The same object can as easily be the surface of the moon, seen in a long shot, or a shriveled, pock-marked basketball photographed in close-up.</p>
        <p>A traffic light hanging over a highway is just a traffic light. In ''Twin Peaks,'' when the shot is held too long, the light takes on a significance that has nothing to do with traffic lights as most of us register them.</p>
        <p>Cockroaches examined by Mr. Lynch at their own eye level are as big and menacing as jackals. ''Eraserhead,'' the director's first and most surreal comedy, features an old-fashioned steam radiator that, with a slight adjustment in lighting, suddenly looks like the facade of the Metropolitan Opera House.</p>
        <p>Behind the opening credits of Mr. Lynch's new film, ''Wild at Heart,'' an ordinary kitchen match is struck. The screen erupts with the roar of a blast furnace. The flames are of a heat and an intensity to melt a Cadillac Seville.</p>
        <p>It's the old fun-house principle. Nightmares are made real. Without moving, one seems to plummet through pitch darkness. The response in a fun house is a pleasurably scary physical sensation. The Lynch films go several steps further: nothing in life is fixed. All reality is relative.</p>
        <p>They suggest that though the universe is without end, it may exist within the tip of a blade of grass.</p>
        <p>''Wild at Heart,'' which was awarded the Palme d'Or at this year's Cannes Film Festival, has as its inspiration Barry Gifford's road novel about Lula Pace Fortune and her lover, Sailor Ripley. Lula is just 20 years old and self-described as hotter than Georgia asphalt. Sailor Ripley is a gentle young man who has just served 22 months and 18 days for manslaughter, having killed a man who attacked him with a knife.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gifford's novel follows Lula and Sailor from Cape Fear, N.C., to the end of the line in Big Tuna, Tex. They, in turn, are followed by Marietta, Lula's mother, who is a former beauty queen, and a private detective named Johnnie Farragut. The novel ambles easily through conversation in which people's characters and lives are largely understood through the brand names they choose to drop.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lynch has taken this slim, vivid work and pumped it up into a cockeyed epic that goes back to the early days of Pop art.</p>
        <p>In the center of the picture are the sweetly dopey, flat, shadowless figures of Lula (Laura Dern) and Sailor (Nicolas Cage), driving toward Big Tuna and earnestly realizing their destiny. Along the way they make intense love, smoke Kools and Camels, eat burgers, drink beer and consider the future (''I'm sorry, Sailor,'' says Lula after some introspection, ''but the ozone layer is disappearing.'') Around Lula and Sailor Mr. Lynch has created a kind of frieze of melodramatic characters and events - flashbacks as well as concurrent actions, which sometimes enrich the film and sometimes have no pertinence except as found objects. It's a matter of scale again.</p>
        <p>There's an almost completely incoherent subplot involving a certain Mr. Reindeer (W. Morgan Sheppard), who is somehow associated with the hit man whom the film's Marietta has hired to find and kill Sailor.</p>
        <p>Though Mr. Reindeer is probably not on the screen for more than five minutes out of more than two hours, he looms large, not for what he does but for the way Mr. Lynch presents him, as a soft-core porn film's idea of a master of crime.</p>
        <p>The suave, chilly, etiolated Mr. Reindeer seems to spend all his days sitting at a dining room table surrounded by handmaidens. The comic-book sexiness of the scene is just slightly marred by the figure of one woman on crutches and of another with a club foot. The images are bizarre but, like so many things in the movie, random. At other times, it is difficult to separate Mr. Lynch's point of view from those of his characters, which, too, is possibly a joke. Lula and Sailor see themselves as driving on their own Yellow Brick Road in search of a Wizard of Oz. There's not only talk of the Wicked Witch, but Marietta, played with fine, sleazy zest by Diane Ladd, actually wears wicked-witch shoes. At the end of the film, the good witch Glinda floats down into the movie in what appears to be a large soap bubble.</p>
        <p>Willem Dafoe, wearing brown teeth that are wired together, comes on near the end of the film as the no-good Bobby Peru, a fellow of nearly sublime disgustingness. In one of the film's toughest scenes, he enters Lula's Big Tuna motel room and, after commenting on the smell of the vomit in the rug, puts the make on her. When, terrified, she gives in, he humiliates her further by pushing her away.</p>
        <p>Harry Dean Stanton, who always looks the same in every movie but never is, appears as Marietta's would-be lover, a private detective of some complexity. It's a terse, dense portrait of a weasely man with a wide streak of decency in him. Isabella Rossellini, who has yet to get a good part in a respectable American movie, plays another ill-defined role, that of Mr. Dafoe's Mexican mistress, whose greatest distinction is her unnaturally blond hair.</p>
        <p>Crispin Glover shows up as Lula's eccentric cousin, a guy who is fixated on Christmas and, for pleasure, puts cockroaches into his underwear. Mr. Lynch believes that more is more but, after a while, the film's odd inventions begin to exhaust. Unlike those in ''Blue Velvet,'' these inventions become ends in themselves. This works better with something hung on a living room wall than with a narrative projected onto a movie screen. One comes out of the theater feeling as if the mind has begun to melt.</p>
        <p>Though Miss Dern and Mr. Cage are constantly upstaged by the rest of the movie, they triumph. There's nothing phony or self-deceiving about Miss Dern's performance as a young woman who has lost her baby fat without entirely growing up. She is a character in a country-and-western ballad come to life.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cage is not always an easy actor to accommodate. He tends to go over the edge. Here, however, he has a role that perfectly fits him, like the Elvis-inspired snakeskin jacket he wears (and which, Sailor says, symbolizes his individuality). This time it's the director, not Mr. Cage, who gets out of hand.</p>
        <p>The two young stars form the sane center of the film. As much as anything else, they keep ''Wild at Heart'' from permanently breaking up into its out-of-scale components: a fleeting image of a severed head, a long solemn examination of a toilet bowl, a shot of Miss Ladd wearing a white satin dress, a girlish bow in her hair and holding a martini, straight up, its olives genteelly pierced by toothpicks.</p>
        <p>''Wild at Heart,'' beautifully photographed by Mark Plummer, looks very modish. This time, though, Mr. Lynch's conceits are less often pleasurably disorienting than out of focus.</p>
