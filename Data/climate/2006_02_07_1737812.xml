        <p>The endless fields of corn in the Midwest can be distilled into endless gallons of ethanol, a clean-burning, high-octane fuel that could end any worldwide oil shortage, reduce emissions that cause global warming, and free the United States from dependence on foreign energy.</p>
        <p>There is only one catch: Turning corn into ethanol takes energy. For every gallon that an ethanol manufacturing plant produces, it uses the equivalent of almost two-fifths of a gallon of fuel (usually natural gas), and that does not count the fuel needed to make fertilizer for the corn, run the farm machinery or truck the ethanol to market.</p>
        <p>The use of all that fossil fuel to make ethanol substantially reduces its value as an alternative source of energy. Not that ethanol is useless. For one thing, it is far easier than natural gas to use in motor vehicles.</p>
        <p>Production is expected to hit five billion gallons this year, equal to more than 3 percent of gasoline supplies, and more ethanol distilleries are being built. [In his State of the Union message, President Bush called for research on ''cutting-edge methods of producing ethanol.'']</p>
        <p>But if ethanol is to realize its potential, its proponents recognize that they will have to develop new ways to make it without using so much natural gas -- or coal, as some distilleries are doing to save money.</p>
        <p>''In this industry, you can't take a parochial view of your business,'' said William A. Lee, general manager of Chippewa Valley Ethanol, in Benson, Minn., and former chairman of the Renewable Fuels Association, an ethanol trade group. ''We have to be headed to a more sustainable future.'' Engineers are trying a variety of methods. Here are several of the most promising.</p>
        <p>Get Help From the Cow</p>
        <p>Some companies are building ethanol plants next to cattle feeding operations, so that corn can go through the ethanol distillery, and then residues from the operation -- basically corn, minus the starch -- can go straight to the cattle as feed.</p>
        <p>The corn passes through the cow, and the manure may come back to the plant and go into a contraption called an anaerobic digester, which mimics the conditions in a cow's stomach so that bacteria can produce methane, a component of natural gas.</p>
        <p>Get Closer to the Cow</p>
        <p>The corn residues, called distillers grains, can be exposed to high-temperature steam, to turn their carbohydrates into hydrocarbons. If the distillers grains are used as cattle feed, the resulting manure can also be exposed to steam to produce hydrocarbons.</p>
        <p>Ethanol takes energy to make because it requires a lot of steam. Typically, the steam is used to blast cornstarch and water into a smooth mixture, keeping the mixture at an ideal temperature for enzymes to break down the valuable chemicals in the starch and for yeast to turn corn sugars into alcohol. Then the mixture is heated to distill off the alcohol, and the remaining distillers grains are usually dried to extend their shelf life until they can be eaten by cattle.</p>
        <p>Some ethanol producers skip the drying, if there are enough cattle nearby that the grains can be eaten promptly. In Sioux Center, Iowa, at the Siouxland Energy and Livestock Cooperative, local farmers opened a plant in 2001 that is adjacent to a 10,000-head feedlot.</p>
        <p>By not drying the grains, Siouxland has reduced its natural-gas consumption to 24,000 B.T.U. per gallon of ethanol -- meaning that the natural gas it uses has an energy value less than one-third that of the ethanol it makes, creating 85,000 B.T.U. a gallon when burned. (This calculation does not count the electricity the plant uses, or the diesel fuel used to haul the ethanol to a filling station.)</p>
        <p>Make a New Kind of Gas</p>
        <p>At the Iowa Energy Center, a state-financed lab here amid the cornfields near the Iowa State University campus, engineers are experimenting with another technique.</p>
        <p>A cluster of steam pipes, gleaming steel tanks, augers and hoppers, assembled by a start-up engineering firm called Frontline Bioenergy, is replacing natural gas with another gas on a small scale, for now.</p>
        <p>The new gas is made from the part of the corn plant that is not the kernel, chopped into pieces half an inch long and dumped into a tank with steam and a limited amount of air.</p>
        <p>In a process called partial oxidation, the steam breaks apart the plant's carbohydrates into two gases: elemental hydrogen and carbon monoxide. Both burn nicely as a substitute for natural gas.</p>
        <p>About 90 percent of the material turns to gas; some of the remainder is minerals that can be sold for other uses. The process consumes natural gas to get started, but after that, it burns the gas it makes to sustain itself.</p>
        <p>''It's a renewable substitute for natural gas,'' said Norman Reese, general manager of Frontline Bioenergy.</p>
        <p>The corn parts that the process uses, called stover, are left in the field. They could be burned directly but would be much dirtier that way.</p>
        <p>But Back to the Cow</p>
        <p>A variety of materials can be turned into gas, including manure.</p>
        <p>''Manure is just partly processed biomass,'' said Jerod Smeenk, engineering manager at Frontline Bioenergy.</p>
        <p>Chippewa Valley Ethanol, the Minnesota company, plans to have a pilot-scale plant running in about a year, using distillers grains. The choice is not ideal, because the grains are not waste; they have a market value as cattle feed. But it is a low-risk choice for Chippewa, which can invest in the equipment needed to gather stover if the gasifier works as promised.</p>
        <p>Companies like Chippewa may promote their aspiration to protect the environment, but they are also driven by price. When the ethanol industry started 20 years ago, it took twice as much natural gas to make a gallon of ethanol as it does now, said Mr. Lee, the general manager. But gas was much cheaper then.</p>
        <p>Right now, Chippewa is paying as much as $12 per million B.T.U. for natural gas, compared with $2 in the mid-1980's, and Mr. Lee said gasification ''makes economic sense'' when gas costs $10 or more per million B.T.U.</p>
        <p>At Frontline, John Reardon, the research and development manager, said of the gasification project: ''It's just a step. But our whole economy is based on fossil energy, and we have to make a step somewhere.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  February 16, 2006, Thursday  An illustration in Science Times on Feb. 7 with an article about energy-efficient ways to make ethanol from corn misidentified an ingredient in one manufacturing process. It is stillage, a byproduct of distillation. (Silage is raw plant matter preserved in a silo to make animal feed.)</p>
