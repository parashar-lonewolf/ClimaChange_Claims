        <p>LEAD: Hundreds of native American plant species are in such imminent danger that they may vanish in the next five years, according to a major new report based on the findings of more than 90 botanists and horticulturalists.</p>
        <p>Hundreds of native American plant species are in such imminent danger that they may vanish in the next five years, according to a major new report based on the findings of more than 90 botanists and horticulturalists.</p>
        <p>The study found that 253 species of trees, shrubs, grasses and other plants face a real risk of extinction within five years. And if nothing is done to control current development patterns, the report found, 427 other species could disappear by the end of the century.</p>
        <p>Biologists said they hoped the report would help drive a new campaign to protect the country's endangered plants, which have generally received less attention than animals in conservation programs in this country and around the world. Plant species are believed to be disappearing at an even more rapid rate in other areas of the world, particularly the tropics.</p>
        <p>Among the reasons for concern over the species, the experts said, is the vital new role that genes from wild plant species are playing in genetic experiments to improve crops and horticultural plants.</p>
        <p>Among the species on the critical list are the large-flowered amsinckia, a plant with brilliant yellow-orange flowers found only on one Army property in California; the ashy dogweed, whose daisy-like flowers have been found in a single roadside population in Texas, and the pretty shrub of the madder family that is growing at the base of a mountain cliff in Hawaii, the only known survivor of its species.</p>
        <p>The findings emerged from a survey in 1987 and 1988 of botanical experts around the country. The survey was conducted by the Center for Plant Conservation, a private foundation based in Boston and the results were presented today at a news conference here at the Smithsonian Institution.</p>
        <p>''This survey quantifies an entire dimension of endangerment - time,'' said Don Falk, executive director of the Center for Plant Conservation. Although scientists knew that many plants were threatened, he said they often did not know how much time there was for countermeasures.</p>
        <p>''Now, for the first time, we have a grip on how much time is left,'' he said. His center, which has ties with research institutions around the country, plans to promote collection of specimens of imminently endangered plants so they can at least be preserved in botanical gardens and arboretums. The center also plans to promote storage of their seeds in seed banks.</p>
        <p>Scientists have previously estimated that about 3,000 plant species, more than 10 percent of an estimated 25,000 species of native plants in the United States, are in some danger of extinction. The new survey should help conservationists identify those that need special priority. The species are imperiled by destruction of their habitat, incursion by non-native species, depradation by collectors and other threats, experts said.</p>
        <p>Although every state has some plants in danger, three-fourths of the 680 species identified as most vulnerable are found in only Hawaii, California, Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico. The endangered species are concentrated in tropical or semi-tropical regions, which experts said tended to have a greater diversity of species occupying smaller smaller ecological niches than in temperate areas. As a result they are more vulnerable the destruction of a specific habitat. In addition, the regions are undergoing extremely rapid development.</p>
        <p>Dr. Thomas E. Lovejoy, the Smithsonian Institution's assistant secretary for external affairs, said the survey ''dramatically illustrates that the problems of plant extinction are not limited to the tropical rain forests but are right here in our backyard.''</p>
        <p>''What these results tell us is that the United States is not doing an adequate job of protecting endangered species,'' Dr. Lovejoy said. ''If we are sitting here worrying about biological diversity vanishing in tropical forests, we are setting one hell of a bad example.'' Second-Class Citizens</p>
        <p>The threat of plant extinction is even greater worldwide than it is in the United States. Dr. Bruce MacBryde, a botanist for the Interior Department's Fish and Wildlife Service, said that up to 20 percent of the planet's estimated 300,000 plant species are in danger of extinction. The greatest losses are occurring in the diverse tropical rain forests, where many species have not yet even been identified.</p>
        <p>One problem, experts agree, is that plants are the second-class citizens of endangered species in the public mind, in the legal protection they are afforded and in the resources devoted to them by national and international agencies charged with protecting threatened flora and fauna.</p>
        <p>''Plants are important for economic, medicinal and economic reasons but the public generally doesn't even know they exist much less their value,'' Dr. MacBryde said. He added that the endangered species office at the Interior Department has far fewer experts working on plants than on animals.</p>
        <p>Dr. MacBryde is also chairman of a recently formed plants committee of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Flora and Fauna, an international agreement formed to control traffic in plant and animal species. ''So far the treaty has mainly worked for animals,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Eugene Lapointe, Secretary-General of the international body formed to carry out the convention, said in an interview that the treaty should be doing more to stop illegal trade in endangered species of orchids, cacti and other plants, but has ''very little resources to do it.''</p>
        <p>''The public would not sit still,'' Dr. MacBryde said, if efforts were not made to save such animals as whooping cranes and black-footed ferrets. Property of Land Owners</p>
        <p>Faith Campbell, an expert on endangered species for the Natural Resources Defense Counsel, a non-profit environmental group, said that in the United States, as in a number of other countries, the law regards wild animals as public property while plants are viewed as the property of the owner of the land on which they grow. As a result, she said, the governments have less power to protect endangered plants.</p>
        <p>Mr. Falk of the Center for Plant Conservation said about 200 species of native American plants have become extinct since the first Europeans arrived in North America. Without human intervention, he said, the natural extinction rate is about 1 plant species every 1,000 years.</p>
        <p>But in the next decade, he said, the country faces several more times the number of plant extinctions than it experienced since the first colonists arrived.</p>
        <p>To collect the information for the study, the center sent a list of more than 800 rare and endangered plants, derived largely from the Fish and Wildlife Service and the Nature Conservancy, a private conservation group, to botanists, horticulturists and other experts around the country. The experts were asked to classify the plants in their areas as species that would become extinct in the next five years, or in the next 10 years, or those could be expected to survive beyond 10 years. They were also asked to rank any additional species they were concerned about. Threat From Development</p>
        <p>Many of the endangered plants are vulnerable because there are only a few specimens remaining in one or a handful of sites. Mr. Falk said that several years ago he found that there were only five remaining sites on which Dicerandra immaculata, a delicate member of the mint family that lives in sandy Florida scrubland, survives. ''I went back this year and found that one site had been destroyed and the other four all had 'For Sale' signs,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In the East, most of the threat to plants comes from private development, but in the West one of the biggest problems is poor management of public lands by the Federal Government, Mr. Falk said.</p>
        <p>He said one of the worst problems is the grazing permitted on the vast stretches of rangeland under the jurisdiction of the Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management. Such grazing, he said, has caused serious soil erosion and permitted the introduction of exotic species. The result, he said, is that many plants native to the range, including several varieties of Astragalus, a milk vetch of the pea family, are now ''at the edge of extinction.''</p>
        <p>Many of the vulnerable species are horticulturally related to familiar plants like rhododendrons, magnolias, irises, lilies, avacodos, blueberries, firs, oaks, birches and pines. In an age of genetic engineering, Mr Falk said, these plants have particular importance for the future because the genes of related plants are the easiest to transfer. 'An Evolutionary Experiment'</p>
        <p>Moreover, with the world facing the prospect of climate change because of global warming, it will be more necessary than ever to have the genetic resources available to change plants to make them more adaptable to warmer or drier or more variable weather conditions, Mr. Falk said.</p>
        <p>''Every species is an evolutionary experiment and rare plants tend to be recent evolutionary species,'' Mr. Falk said. ''We can use them to understand the evolutionary process. It would be a tragedy if we interfered with the process.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Campbell of the Natural Resources Defense Council said that the plan to preserve plants by growing them in botanical gardens or by saving seeds in banks is not entirely satisfactory because ''the plants are not part of the ecosystems anymore.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Falk agreed that the ''optimum is to have as many plants in wild populations as possible.'' But sometimes, he said, it is not possible. If a plant exists only in a limited range on private property and that range is destroyed, it cannot be returned to the wild.</p>
        <p>The center and its allies, therefore, intend to apply the concept of integrated conservation: protecting plants by law when possible, acquiring land to protect endangered species when possible, trying to improve the management of lands inhabited by endangered plants and saving the plants in botanical gardens. Mr. Falk said that a program to rescue all the plants in danger of extinction by the end of the century would cost about $10 million to $15 million.</p>
        <p>''The ultimate goal is survival at any cost,'' Mr. Falk said.</p>
