        <p>LEAD: Gregory R. Long, director of the $307 million campaign for the New York Public Library, was elected yesterday as president of the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx, with a promise that the 98-year-old institution would come to the fore on environmental issues.</p>
        <p>Gregory R. Long, director of the $307 million campaign for the New York Public Library, was elected yesterday as president of the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx, with a promise that the 98-year-old institution would come to the fore on environmental issues.</p>
        <p>At age 42, Mr. Long has already had a wide-ranging career in nonprofit institutions, including the New York Zoological Society, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the American Museum of Natural History.</p>
        <p>''He strikes me and others as someone who really has the ability to project a vision, then go after it, get it done and take a lot of people with him,'' said James L. Ferguson, chairman of the board of managers of the Garden and chairman of the executive committee of General Foods.</p>
        <p>Mr. Long is to succeed Dr. James M. Hester, who will turn 65 next month and is retiring to direct the Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation. 'It Could Be Better Loved'</p>
        <p>The Botanical Garden encompasses 250 acres of plantings, gardens and forest in Bronx Park, the 1,924-acre Mary Flagler Cary Arboretum in Millbrook, N.Y., the Institute of Ecosystem Studies, the Institute of Economic Botany and the Herbarium, a collection of 5.2 million plant specimens.</p>
        <p>Mr. Long's tenure as the eighth president is to begin May 1, at a salary that is still being negotiated. In an interview Sunday, he outlined his vision of the garden and its future.</p>
        <p>''It is, first, a teaching organization, through exhibitions and public display,'' he said. ''It is also a research organization, finding out things we don't know and need to know to protect the natural world and save endangered species. It's a lot more than 'I have a window box - how do I handle my geraniums?'</p>
        <p>''I think it could be better loved, better appreciated and better used. I'm not sure yet how, exactly. But some of the techniques that have been used in other institutions may work - the involvement of more volunteers and more people with civic interests.</p>
        <p>''The garden could do more about public education on environmental issues.'' Schooled as an Art Historian</p>
        <p>Mr. Long started thinking about the Botanical Garden last year, as the world worried about the greenhouse effect, as medical debris washed up on local beaches and, even closer to home, as he watched a favorite maple tree die from pollution - perhaps, he said, from acid rain.</p>
        <p>''I was very much touched by the deterioration of the natural world,'' Mr. Long said. ''The garden's involving itself in public education about conservation and also more generally in public policy-making at the state and Federal levels is quite important to me.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Long was born and raised in Kansas City, Mo., but left to attend New York University and become an art historian. ''My family wanted me to make a more conventional choice,'' he said, ''but this was the 1960's.''</p>
        <p>From 1969 to 1971, he was executive assistant to Ashton Hawkins, secretary of the Metropolitan Museum. From 1972 to 1975, he directed development and membership at the American Museum of Natural History.</p>
        <p>Then he joined the New York Zoological Society as deputy director for development and membership. He stayed there until 1982, also nurturing an affection for the ''sister institution'' that shares Bronx Park.</p>
        <p>''I found myself always going to the Botanical Garden,'' Mr. Long said. ''There was a nice place to eat lunch. I'm an avid user of the Enid A. Haupt Conservatory.'' 'Loves Doing What He Does'</p>
        <p>Mr. Long came to the library in 1982 and is vice president for public affairs and development. Dr. Vartan Gregorian, the president of the library, credits Mr. Long with helping to raise some $150 million in private money of the $290 million that has been realized so far in the fund-raising campaign.</p>
        <p>Brooke Astor, a patron of the zoo and the library, said of Mr. Long: ''He put enormous life into the zoo. He did exactly the same thing at the library. He loves doing what he does. And I think he'll put that all into the Botanical Garden. He can't help it. It's his nature.''</p>
        <p>''He has helped make the New York Public Library - think about it a minute - the hot institution of the 1980's,'' said Kenneth Roman Jr., a board member at the Botanical Garden and chairman and chief executive of the Ogilvy Group. ''I think he can bring that kind of excitement to the Botanic Garden.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Long, who is single, lives on the Upper West Side of Manhattan and has a farm upstate in Otsego County, with apple and pear orchards, a perennial and a rose garden. ''But I'm a total amateur in these things,'' he said.</p>
