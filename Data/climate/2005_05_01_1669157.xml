        <p>IF you read the newspapers and watch TV, you may think that we live in a maelstrom of technological change. Who can cope?</p>
        <p>But consider the very papers and television signals that bring us this news. One relies on a technology that is ancient; the other is just old hat. And the news that they bring -- of dizzying technological upheaval -- is the news they have always brought.</p>
        <p>Thirty-five years after the futurist Alvin Toffler persuaded us that things were changing so fast that people couldn't keep up, we still live in the same sort of houses, read the same sort of alarmist books and get around in the very same way -- in cars, planes and trains, none of them much faster than they used to be.</p>
        <p>These thoughts are suggested by the plans of the New York Stock Exchange to merge with Archipelago and, implicitly, to embrace electronic trading. On the surface, the implication is another big change: No more shouting and jostling on the trading floor. No more celebrity bell ringers to open the day's trading.</p>
        <p>But perhaps a more suitable response is this: What on earth has taken so long? The technology for electronic trading has been around for years and is used widely on other exchanges. It's another example of how the pace of technological change is not nearly as fast as it's made out to be -- or as it could and should be.</p>
        <p>The slash-and-burn treatment of cancer, the reliance on fossil fuels, the continuing physical delivery of paper and ink, the persistence of checks and cash, the unchanging qwerty keyboard -- all are examples of stasis that suggest we're not moving nearly as fast as we might.</p>
        <p>Clearly, the Internet is a big change. But in the United States, the rollout of broadband is way behind that of advanced regions of Asia. And despite the growth of Amazon, Google, eBay and the like, the Internet's proportion of advertising and retail sales remains relatively modest. Visit the doctor, meanwhile, and you still get a prescription scribbled on paper that you then must carry to a pharmacist in hopes that it will be deciphered, and filled, correctly.</p>
        <p>Benjamin Hunt, in ''The Timid Corporation'' (John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2003), observed that the 19th and early 20th centuries gave us such radical developments as the railroad, the telegraph, the telephone, electric motors and internal combustion engines. The airplane and the radio were invented. Today, he writes, ''the pace of change is much too slow.''</p>
        <p>If that is so, why? Mr. Hunt suggests that corporations are hamstrung by regulation, legal liability and bureaucratic timidity. There is truth in this, but government also promotes change by paying for research -- that's how the Internet was invented -- and for projects like Interstate highways and the space program. The legal system is also a two-edged sword, slowing progress via the tort system and hastening it by protecting individual rights.</p>
        <p>A very different answer comes from that well-known family of philosophers, the Jetsons. The original episodes, from the early 1960's, portray a classically futuristic society complete with cars that fly, biomorphic buildings and quirky robots. Otherwise, life for the Jetsons was no different than it was for the Flintstones. Dad works and worries; Mom stays home except when she's out spending money; and families (like the power source one imagines for the Jetsons) were nuclear.</p>
        <p>REAL life is the opposite. Robots aren't working as housekeepers, but the nation has experienced enormous social change in the last 40 years. Maybe society's innovative energies have gone into making, and coping with, those changes, which include large-scale immigration, the changing role of women, growing racial and ethnic diversity, the increasing acceptance of gay men and lesbians, and the wholesale suburbanization of what had been an urban and rural society.</p>
        <p>As these changes become the norm, the innovation pace may accelerate. Then again, as the world's affluent societies age, the pace may slow. Will the old take risks or defend the status quo? Will the young study science or cinema? Will there be scenes of bedlam on the trading floor, or will they exist only in a stock exchange museum, where actors shout themselves hoarse, re-enacting how it was long ago?</p>
