        <p>LEAD: In celebration of the 20th recycling of Earth Day, the folk musician Glen McClure will perform a concert in Rochester on an instrument made entirely of garbage.</p>
        <p>In celebration of the 20th recycling of Earth Day, the folk musician Glen McClure will perform a concert in Rochester on an instrument made entirely of garbage.</p>
        <p>He won't be alone. Around the world, ecological activists will join publicity-hungry celebrities and tie-in-conscious corporations to whoop it up for the salvation of the planet. In Germany, 10,000 trees will be planted along the site of the Berlin wall; in Japan, a campaign will be launched against the use of wooden chopsticks.</p>
        <p>In 1969, when this environmental brainchild of Wisconsin Senator Gaylord Nelson's hove into view, the Nixon White House embraced it. Why not? Conservation, as the organized love of nature was previously called, was a Teddy Roosevelt crusade, and besides, it was good to have the fierce energy of young, white, elitist demonstrators channeled into other than anti-war protests.</p>
        <p>Now the day has become a week (Tuesday is Recycling Day, Friday Toxics Information Day), and morning-show hosts are poised to deluge their audiences with guests fluent in tech-bashing greenspeak.</p>
        <p>Politicians mired in peace and prosperity are seeking a new source of voter interest aboard this new Motherhood Express. Senator Al Gore of Tennessee, who has genuine anti-pollution credentials, dropped by a few months ago to deliver an impressive briefing on the danger of carbon dioxide; Jesse Jackson is now trying to steal the issue from him, on the dubious theory that poor neighborhoods become waste disposal dumps.</p>
        <p>For Republicans, George Bush has nicely split the political difference between concern and cost: we are for clean air and water, but not against necessary industries that pollute a little and employ a lot. ''Think globally and act locally,'' he advises; better to clean up a single eyesore than to curse the dark forces of pollution.</p>
        <p>We are all environmentalists now, but we are not all planetists. I sit here in West Virginia on weekends watching the white-water rafters shoot the rapids on the Shenandoah River, and I haul my garbage back to Washington, where it seems to belong; my mountain retreat is no Walden, but nature has its pleasures and deserves respect.</p>
        <p>A planetist, on the other hand, puts the Earth ahead of the earthlings -places society's responsibility for the individual ahead of the individual's responsibility for himself.</p>
        <p>The planetist sees the world whole, as if from space; this ultimate outsider discerns global danger with great certainty and demands supranational solutions at any cost to avert nothing less than extinction.</p>
        <p>Just in time for Earth Day's publicity extravaganza, I submit this guide for pro-earthling non-planetism: 1. First, do no harm. When planetism takes global warming as an article of faith, but NASA's latest scientific study refutes it, the layman should err on the side of caution. If it doesn't trigger a depression, ease up on the carbon dioxide. 2. Demand to see the whole agenda. Before joining the Greens or making ecology your switcher issue, call for truth in activism: are we all supposed to return to a simpler life? What of those who like crowded cities, or dig glitz? Is the third world to be denied development or be subsidized to stay backward and pure? 3. Love the activist, hate the power-grabber. The Earth Day organizers have done much good, and saw a legitimate health concern before most of us did. But watch out for the bureaucratization of the goo-goos, in the form of a ''Green Seal'' of approval, to force companies to obey standards set by unelected overseers. 4. Press the ''eco-eco effect.'' Ecology and economics go hand in hand; instead of railing against greedy corporations or too-protective unions, or complaining about a ''license to pollute,'' use economic incentives to clean the air and water. People pollute because it is cheap and easy; by using tax policy to make it expensive and hard, we will change behavior the productive way. 5. Put a higher value on growth than on limitation. Malthus was mistaken; the world can produce and then feed and shelter billions of human beings.</p>
        <p>We are not a race blindly bent on suicide by mindless self-strangulation; on this peculiarly blessed planet, we are among the sperm cells and ova of the universe - and in a century or two, our descendants will be coordinating our celebration with the colonists whooping it up for Mars Day and Venus Day.</p>
