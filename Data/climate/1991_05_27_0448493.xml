        <p>Before video rental outlets, taverns, a golf course, a 22-bed jail, a courthouse and holiday gridlock came to this slice of ancient America, the biggest diversion was the crash of waterfalls on granite walls.</p>
        <p>Overwhelmed by the symphony of water on rock in Yosemite Valley, John Muir, a founding voice of the conservation movement, said, "No temple made with human hands can compare."</p>
        <p>But on the 75th anniversary of the National Park Service, this preserve and 80 million other acres protected by an idea that America pioneered are under siege by human hands.</p>
        <p>From the saw grass marshes of the Everglades in Florida to the glaciers of Denali in Alaska, the national parks are faced with threats from within, as the clutter of concessions has turned wild domains into comfortable playgrounds, and threats from without, as urban frontiers and a tide of pollutants advance. At the same time, there is soul searching among park officials about their mission: Are they running theme parks, the best of Disney and geology, or zoos without cages?  In Search of the Park Role</p>
        <p>This year, nearly 300 million visitors will spend some time in one of the 357 monuments, seashores, historic homes or recreation areas run by the Park Service. Within 15 years, as the world grows more crowded and open space continues to disappear, the number of visitors is expected to double.</p>
        <p>But it is not so much the crowds that concern park officials and conservationists; even in a park like Yosemite, which is often so packed it limits the number of automobiles to the spectacular valley, most people never venture more than a few hundred yards from their cars. It is pressures outside the parks, from acid rain to smog to residential development to the loss of water needed to keep many parks alive that are setting off most alarms.</p>
        <p>"We've got air so bad on the border of this park that it is killing trees," said Michael V. Finley, superintendent of Yosemite, in the Sierra Nevada range of eastern California. "We're talking about threats to the basic fabric of every park. Flora and fauna is what we're all about, and that's in trouble because of what's approaching us from out there."  Scenic Outposts of the Past</p>
        <p>The parks, once called "islands of hope," have become true islands: scenic outposts of another America surrounded by a sea of civilization. The nation's biggest trees, its oldest living things, largest herds of wildlife, cleanest water and some of the last natural secrets are in the parks, protected by a 1916 Government mandate to preserve them "unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations."</p>
        <p>But while America may have originated the idea of national parks, a system adopted by more than 100 nations, it has fallen behind in upkeep and preservation, in the view of some longtime experts.</p>
        <p>"America's national parks are screaming to us, from sea to shining sea, from rim to rim, to do something to save them," said Paul Pritchard, president of the National Parks and Conservation Association, a 300,000-member parks watchdog group.</p>
        <p>Even the upbeat Director of the National Park Service, James M. Ridenour, said he was "shocked and surprised at the deterioration of some of our best-known national parks."  A Year for Taking Stock</p>
        <p>Much of the plant and animal life that found sanctuary inside the parks has flourished, to a remarkable degree. But bison and grizzly bears, king salmon and egrets and 2,000-year-old redwoods need more than what is inside park boundaries to stay alive, biologists and park rangers say.</p>
        <p>Urban encroachment, in all its forms, is at the top of the list of problems cited by park officials in this diamond anniversary year of taking stock.</p>
        <p>The Everglades, considered the most endangered park in the system, has lost 90 percent of its wading birds since the 1930's, park officials say. Last year Congress authorized $700 million, to be spent over 10 years, to try to save the Everglades. The problem is that water, the life source of the "River of Grass," as the Everglades are known, has been drained, diverted and polluted by the crush of development in South Florida.</p>
        <p>Acid rain has stripped high-altitude trees of their foliage in the Great Smoky Mountains, the most popular park in the system with more than eight million visitors a year.  Health Hazard in Hiking</p>
        <p>Smog from Los Angeles and haze from a coal-fired power plant in Arizona obscures the view from rim-to-rim in the Grand Canyon. Similarly, the air in Kings Canyon/Sequoia National Parks, just south of here, is so bad that rangers are thinking of posting signs warning that hiking on certain days constitutes a health hazard.</p>
        <p>Zion National Park, in southern Utah, risks losing the wild river that carved its most spectacular canyon; the fast-growing community of St. George, north of the park, wants to dam the east fork of the Virgin River to provide water for its new residents.</p>
        <p>Logging has so decimated the hillsides next to Olympic and Mount Rainier National Parks, in Washington State, that fish runs are a fraction of what they used to be as erosion has filled the streams with silt.</p>
        <p>In the tradition of the first director of the national parks, Stephen T. Mather, who blew up a sawmill inside Glacier National Park, some park superintendents are starting to take a more active role in fighting outside threats.</p>
        <p>Managers of Shenandoah National Park, in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia, have come out against plans to build new coal-burning power plants in the state. They say the plant's sulfur dioxide emissions, falling as acid rain, would hasten the demise of a park where fish and trees are already dying from industrial acid.</p>
        <p>In Olympic Park the superintendent, Maureen Finnerty, is waging a campaign to tear down two dams, one inside the park, one outside, which supply power to a nearby paper mill but have destroyed a run of giant king salmon.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Finley was superintendent of the Everglades, he outlawed jet skis in the park. Now, at Yosemite, he has gone up against farmers and water managers who want to seed the clouds of central California with silver iodide to produce more rain. "For us, this drought is part of the natural cycle," he said. "The park needs it."</p>
        <p>Inside park boundaries, the battle is over definition.</p>
        <p>"What the Government has got to do is return to the basics of the park, providing food and lodging, and that should be it," said Al Runte, who wrote "Yosemite, the Embattled Wilderness," published last year by the University of Nebraska Press. "If you go to a concert hall to listen to Mozart, you don't want to listen to a rock concert at the same time."  Restricting Adult 'Toys'</p>
        <p>The service has allowed too many of "our toys" into the parks, Mr. Runte said. In response to such criticisim, many parks, while adding more wheelchair access and public transportation, are restricting trail bikes, rafts and recreational vehicles.</p>
        <p>The question of what is an appropriate convenience to have inside a park has taken on fresh urgency with the coming renewal of some major concession contracts. In 1993, the 30-year monopolies that some companies were given to provide services in Mount Rainier, Yellowstone, Grand Canyon and Yosemite National Parks will expire.</p>
        <p>While critics say the concessionaires have too much power and have cluttered the parks with junk souvenirs and overpriced restaurants, many operators say they are simply responding to a demand for what people want.</p>
        <p>As such, the parks reflect consumer tastes. At Yosemite this week, people drinking champagne from glasses inside rented limousines were seen in a parking lot next to hikers wearing T-shirts with the logo "Go Climb a Rock."  Camping Reservations Needed</p>
        <p>Yosemite, in many ways, may be the park of the future. Its quota system for controlling automobiles inside the valley was instituted in 1985, after a Memorial Day throng produced the first case of gridlock in a national park. For several hours, on a hot holiday afternoon, nothing moved inside the valley where Muir, Theodore Roosevelt and Ansel Adams once found their greatest source of inspiration.</p>
        <p>Reservations, through a central ticket agency in Chicago, are already required for camping in the most popular national parks. Now many park officials are calling for restricting entry. The crowds have taken a particularly harsh toll on some national historic sites.</p>
        <p>"When you pass 10,000 people a week through the door of a house that was built for a family of four, that monument is not going to be around for long," Mr. Pritchard said.  A Call for Park Quotas</p>
        <p>William Penn Mott Jr., a former National Parks director who first went to work for the service in 1931 and is still on the payroll as a special assistant, said quotas fly in the face of American democratic ideals but are needed to save the parks.</p>
        <p>"You need a reservation to go to the theater and to go to dinner, why not require one for a national park?" he said.</p>
        <p>The current director, Mr. Ridenour, said he is not ready to restrict, but that it might eventually be necessary.</p>
        <p>Animals, too, have begun to crowd the park. In Yellowstone, a bison herd that used to roam the Great Plains has grown from 50 at the turn of the century to more than 3,000 now. Without adequate range to support them inside the park, the animals have been leaving the boundaries in search of food and are sometimes shot.</p>
        <p>Some bears in the Great Smoky Mountains have stopped foraging for nuts in favor of panhandling for Kentucky Fried Chicken and other scraps of picnic leftovers.</p>
        <p>One way to reduce populations of elk and deer in some parks is to reintroduce an old predator, the wolf -- an idea backed by environmentalists and many lawmakers in Congress, but opposed by the cattle industry and given only lukewarm support by Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr.</p>
        <p>Some species, of course, continue to die off at alarming rates in parks like the Everglades, where only five Florida panthers are said to be left where hundreds use to be. But the fact that other animals have done so well is reason for great optimism among park officials, even if the abundance is a nuisance.</p>
        <p>On the 75th anniversary of the Park Service, these officials say Muir would approve of the system created two years after his death in 1914. Before the advent of the service, the handful of national parks were patrolled by the United States Calvary.</p>
        <p>"The good news is that restoration works," Mr. Finley said. "If we take care of these external threats, the parks will as good or better 75 years from now as they are today. If we do nothing, the parks will be nothing but a remnant of what was once great."</p>
