        <p>At the Republican National Committee on Second Street, allies of Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato held a news conference today to chide Representative Charles E. Schumer, Mr. D'Amato's Democratic challenger, for missing 90 percent of the House Judiciary Committee's votes this year.</p>

        <p>At the Republican National Committee on Second Street, allies of Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato held a news conference today to chide Representative Charles E. Schumer, Mr. D'Amato's Democratic challenger, for missing 90 percent of the House Judiciary Committee's votes this year.</p>
        <p>''Al D'Amato, the tough campaigner, is staying here in Washington doing his job and making his votes, while Schumer is running around the state campaigning at taxpayer expense,'' said Representative Peter T. King, a Republican from Nassau County.</p>
        <p>Barely two hours later, at the Democratic National Committee on South Capitol Street, Mr. Schumer and two Democratic senators attacked Mr. D'Amato for opposing gun control and accepting $36,000 in campaign contributions from the National Rifle Association during his 18 years in the Senate.</p>
        <p>''Al D'Amato has done everything that the National Rifle Association has asked for,'' Mr. Schumer said. ''If there were ever a clearer case of a senator from New York siding with the special interests rather than the people's interests, I haven't seen it.''</p>
        <p>Clinched in one of the nation's closest Senate races this year, Mr. Schumer and Mr. D'Amato have brought their bare-fisted campaigns 350 miles south to Capitol Hill, where Congress is rushing to finish an overflowing schedule by this weekend.</p>
        <p>The Congress's end-of-the-session sprint has produced an odd and awkward geographic challenge to the candidates, who are trying to conduct their legislative business while grabbing the attention of voters and news media that are at least a 60-minute plane ride away.</p>
        <p>Both candidates have sought to make the most of this juggling act all week. But while this has been something of a new task for Mr. Schumer, it is very much in keeping with the style of Mr. D'Amato, who has focused his time, and public relations efforts, on Washington all year.</p>
        <p>The differences say much about the two men's contrasting political needs. Mr. Schumer, largely unknown in large swaths of the state, has needed to campaign more than Mr. D'Amato back home. And Mr. D'Amato, facing a candidate who is running on his lengthy legislative resume, has sought to cast himself as the state's most effective legislator, someone who gets bills passed against the odds.</p>
        <p>So it is that in recent weeks, as Mr. Schumer has been traveling about New York, Mr. D'Amato has ensconced himself in Washington, testifying for acid rain legislation, helping negotiate a sweeping banking bill, and speaking at a commemorative event for Nelson Mandela, the South African President.</p>
        <p>Ever the nimble-footed politician, Mr. D'Amato has also tried to seize on Mr. Schumer's spotty attendance record by citing it in television commercials, news conferences by surrogates and campaign remarks as evidence that the Congressman ''puts politics ahead of people.''</p>
        <p>Mr. D'Amato's aides say the strategy is intended to strike at the heart of what Mr. Schumer considers his strongest political asset: his legislative record and widely accepted reputation as an effective lawmaker. The aides say they think they can also cast Mr. Schumer as a publicity-grabbing opportunist.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Schumer's aides contend that Mr. D'Amato's Washington campaign is really intended to mask what they consider the Senator's greatest liabilities: a lack of interest in legislation, a reputation for placing politics ahead of policy and high negative ratings.</p>
        <p>The Democratic strategists contend that Mr. D'Amato is so concerned about his weak approval ratings that he has done his best to avoid public events in New York, even to the point of not appearing in his own television commercials. ''The man's been there 18 years,'' said Hank Morris, Mr. Schumer's media consultant. ''He has a negative rating. And his handlers are smart enough that they don't want to remind people of him. He knows he can't win an up or down vote on him. He has to try to turn this into two bad choices.''</p>
        <p>Mr. D'Amato's campaign today released a study of the Judiciary Committee votes Mr. Schumer had missed, showing that he had participated in only 21 of 267 votes this year. Among those he missed were votes on bills dealing with sexual abuse of children, anti-drug-abuse programs and parents who fail to pay child support.</p>
        <p>The D'Amato campaign has also produced a commercial saying that Mr. Schumer has missed more votes in the last year, 110, than Mr. D'Amato has in the last 12 years. And it has been releasing almost daily what it calls the ''Chuck Schumer missed votes chronicles,'' which end with the slogan, ''Chuck Schumer: full-time pay, part-time work.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Schumer maintains that his lifetime voting record is 92 percent, and notes that the House votes significantly more often than the Senate. But Mr. D'Amato's strategy seems to have raised some concerns within the Schumer camp, which used today's gun-control event to rebut the Senator's attacks.</p>
        <p>''Chuck has been there for every important vote,'' said Representative Jerrold L. Nadler, a Manhattan Democrat who also sits on the Judiciary Committee. ''Has he been there for every single silly vote, on which piece of salacious sexual material we should release to the public? No.''</p>
