        <p>Toward the end of his whirlwind 16-hour visit here at the international negotiations on global warming, Vice President Al Gore met tonight with representatives of oil, coal and electric companies, assuring them that he would  respect their interests.</p>
        <p>Sitting in the same chair at the same rectangular table less than an hour later, Mr. Gore assured representatives of environmental groups that he would respect their interests.</p>
        <p>These days Mr. Gore tries to satisfy -- or at the very least, not offend -- interest groups that are crucial to his quest for the Democratic Presidential nomination in 2000.</p>
        <p>Increasingly, Mr. Gore has found himself navigating between competing constituencies because he may need them all for campaign contributions and other political support. Just weeks ago, he irritated labor groups and environmentalists when he helped the Administration in its failed attempt to renew President Clinton's authority to reach international trade accords.</p>
        <p>And today, the Vice President's balancing act was on display for a world audience.</p>
        <p>While this trip offered Mr. Gore an opportunity to appear on the world stage addressing his signature issue of global warming, it also exposed him to political risks he might have avoided. If the talks collapse later this week, as some White House officials fear, Mr. Gore could be blamed. If the talks succeed, he can take the credit. Had Mr. Gore stayed home, he may have avoided the controversy but may have been accused of not caring enough about an issue that he used to build his reputation as an environmentalist.</p>
        <p>Even if the nations here fail to produce a treaty on global warming,  Mr. Gore's advisers say the Vice President's presence here at least  moved him beyond months of inquiries and harsh publicity over his fund-raising practices in the 1996 campaign.</p>
        <p>''There's always an element of political risk with issues fraught with so much conflict,'' Thomas S. Foley, the Ambassador to Japan and the former Speaker of the House, said in an interview here.</p>
        <p>Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, a Connecticut Democrat who attended the talks here, said Mr. Gore's visit may have been a turning point -- but may also embolden the Vice President's foes among industrialists.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore insisted that political calculations did not enter into his decision to make the trip, even though he spent months wavering.</p>
        <p>''That wasn't part of my analysis,'' Mr. Gore said in an interview before arriving here. ''My analysis was, 'What can I do to help solve this problem?' ''</p>
        <p>Yet throughout the day, Mr. Gore  dashed through something of a political obstacle course, delicately trying to please one side -- whether it be interest groups or nations that oppose the United States' position -- without losing ground to the other. Washington is urging industries and other generators of greenhouse gases in the United States to bring emissions back to the 1990 level within the next 15 years.</p>
        <p>At one session he met with representatives of industry stalwarts like Edison Electric Power, the International Natural Gas Association, the Business Roundtable and British Petroleum.</p>
        <p>''I look forward to learning from you and hearing your comments to the extent that I can be illuminated,'' Mr. Gore said at the opening of the meeting.</p>
        <p>Soon the industry officials were replaced at the table by senior officials of organizations like the Sierra Club, the Environmental Defense Fund and the Union of Concerned Scientists. Mr. Gore expressed his gratitude to them as well, saying, ''Thank you and your organizations for the commitment you've made in having such a formidable presence here.''</p>
        <p>Despite the complex negotiations, the scene here had the feel of a political event in the United States. Taking a page from Presidential campaigns, representatives from environmental and industry groups swamped reporters with written responses to Mr. Gore's speech, and some passed them out even before the Vice President finished his address.</p>
        <p>Representative John D. Dingell, a Michigan Democrat and longtime advocate for the interests of the automobile industry, who is here as an observer, said Mr. Gore's performance ''could affect many things, including his nomination and election'' prospects in 2000.</p>
        <p>Representative Ron Klink, a Pennsylvania Republican who also attended the proceedings, argued that Mr. Gore could hurt himself in crucial Northeast and Midwest industrial states if he ignored the interests of major industries.</p>
        <p>''There's a tremendous amount of fear by people who are making decisions today on capital investments,'' he said. ''I've got businesses in my district who have postponed making tens of millions of dollars of investments.''</p>
        <p>But for all the warnings from industry loyalists, some environmental groups accuse Mr. Gore of retreating from his commitment to cut emissions of greenhouse gases.</p>
        <p>Arlie Schardt, the executive director of the advocacy group Environmental Media Services, who was Mr. Gore's press secretary in the 1988 Presidential campaign, said he worries that the Vice President is no longer as committed to the issue.</p>
        <p>''I think he feels that he has to give real strong consideration to fossil fuel, oil and coal and automobile industries because of the enormous campaign contributions that they have the capacity to provide,'' Mr. Schardt said. ''I went to work for him because I thought for the first time we had the opportunity to have a dedicated environmentalist as President of the United States. If he lets down the environmental community, he's risking his credibility.''</p>
        <p>But by signaling in his speech here that the United States might make some compromises, the Vice President won praise from environmental groups that were planning to attack him for pressing for a position that they viewed as far more modest than the prescriptions he offered in his best-selling book, ''Earth in the Balance,'' which has been translated into 28 languages.</p>
        <p>Senator John F. Kerry of Massachusetts, who is observing the talks here and weighing whether to seek the Democratic nomination in 2000, said it was too early to tell whether Mr. Gore was spurring on the negotiations. ''It depends entirely on what the instructions really are,'' he said, ''and what the bottom line of the Administration is. And they're the only ones that know that.''</p>
