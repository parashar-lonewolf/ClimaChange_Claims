        <p>FIVE centuries before Columbus, the Norse sailed west across the North Atlantic in search of new lands that were, in the words of their sagas, "habitable and trespassable." They established a colony in Greenland, then moved on to the coast of North America, where they became a long disputed footnote to the history of discovery.</p>
        <p>By now, five centuries after the first Columbus voyage of 1492, scholars agree that the Norse got to the New World much earlier and achieved a substantial foothold. Archeologists believe they have firm evidence for at least one settlement in Newfoundland around the time of Leif Eriksson, in the early 11th century. The mystery now is why the Norse failed to sustain their American enterprise.</p>
        <p>Widening their search, archeologists have also found iron nails, pieces of armor, figurines and other artifacts suggesting a Norse presence in Ellesmere and Baffin Islands to the north and perhaps as far south as Maine. Their visits may have been brief, to hunt and trade or to plunder, but they apparently continued them for several hundred years, almost up to the time of Columbus.</p>
        <p>So it raises again the question, who did "discover" America?</p>
        <p>Of course, ancestors of the Indians and Eskimos were the first inhabitants, having crossed from Asia thousands of years before. Circumstantial evidence, tenuous at best, is advanced from time to time in support of pre-Columbian contacts by the Chinese and Japanese across the Pacific and the Irish, Welsh, Phoenicians, Jews and Africans across the Atlantic.</p>
        <p>Even if the Norse almost certainly preceded Columbus, historians argue, their influence on subsequent American history was inconsequential. Scholars generally credit Columbus with the true discovery, even if he seems never to have been sure where he was, for the reason that his exploits had the immediate and lasting effect of incorporating the Americas into world history.</p>
        <p>"Yes, the Norse were here first, but apart from some ethnic pride, so what?" said Dr. Thomas H. McGovern, an archeologist at Hunter College of the City University of New York who is an authority on the cultural and economic aspects of the Norse explorations. "Historically, it didn't make any big difference."</p>
        <p>Still, the Norse experience fascinates historians and archeologists, in part because it was so widespread but ephemeral, and it is being examined more systematically by a broader range of experts. New efforts to confirm Norse activities in America are being financed by a Danish businessman, Jorgen D. Siemonsen, who directs an international committee of scientists.</p>
        <p>Under the guidance of Dr. McGovern, scholars from 10 countries met in January to establish the North Atlantic Biocultural Organization to promote and coordinate more rigorous investigations of the social and economic dynamics of the Norse ventures. Looking for Cause of Failure</p>
        <p>As the new findings lend credence to the folk tales of adventure in the Icelandic Sagas, scholars are moving beyond simply verifying a Norse presence and are increasingly interested in identifying the likely causes of the ultimate Norse failure to plant permanent roots in America.</p>
        <p>According to the sagas, the Norse first glimpsed the American coast when their ships were blown off course while sailing to their colony in Greenland. Leif Eriksson, son of Erik the Red, the outlaw from Norway and Iceland who founded the Greenland settlement, scouted out the coast, probably crossing the Davis Strait from Greenland, a distance of no more than 200 miles, and catching the south-flowing Labrador Current. The explorers came first to a rocky shore they called Helluland, which is probably present-day Baffin Island, and then to the wooded coast of a placed they named Markland, probably Labrador. Finally, Eriksson reached the land he would call Vinland, a place now assumed to be Newfoundland.</p>
        <p>There, in about the year 1000, Eriksson built a settlement of large houses to serve as a base for commerce and exploration deeper into this new land. Other settlers arrived, including Leif's brother Thorvald. In what may have been the first skirmish between Europeans and the American natives, Thorvald was killed by an arrow.</p>
        <p>In the sagas, when Thorvald drew out the fatal arrow, he had these last words: "There is fat round my belly! We have won a fine and fruitful country, but will hardly be allowed to enjoy it."</p>
        <p>The case for a Norse presence in North America gained respectability in the 1960's with the discovery of the remains of an 11th century settlement at L'Anse aux Meadows, on a northern finger of the island of Newfoundland. A Norwegian explorer, Helge Ingstad, came upon the building remains, and he and his wife, the archeologist Anne Stine Ingstad, led an team of archeologists that excavated the collapsed sod walls of eight buildings, a forge, hearths and other ruins of the settlement.</p>
        <p>"We know it is a Norse site," said Dr. William W. Fitzhugh, an anthropologist with the Smithsonian Institution. "The question is, whose site is it? Leif Eriksson's, perhaps?"</p>
        <p>Dr. Birgitta L. Wallace, an archeologist with the Canadian Parks Service in Halifax, Nova Scotia, completed a comprehensive study of the site last year. The settlement, she concluded, was probably occupied for no more than five or 10 years, with a population of about 100. A soapstone spindle whorl, used in spinning, suggests that not all the Norse settlers were men. Only One Settlement Found</p>
        <p>Also found in the excavations were whole butternuts, which have never grown as far north as Newfoundland. Dr. Wallace cited this as evidence that L'Anse aux Meadows was a gateway settlement, the staging area or winter camp for explorations to the south, especially in the St. Lawrence region that may have been Vinland proper. The settlers presumably shipped lumber back to Greenland, where there was virtually no timber and the forests of Europe were too far away.</p>
        <p>L'Anse aux Meadows is still the only Norse settlement ever found on the North American coast, and the prospect of discovering others seems bleak. From archeological evidence the Greenland colony's population in the 11th century may have been no more than 600. Dr. Wallace said it was doubtful that the small colony could have supported another American outpost the size of the one in Newfoundland.</p>
        <p>Although archeologists might find remains of later settlements, perhaps from the 14th century when the Greenland colony had grown to about 7,000 people, their searches so far have turned up only isolated bits and pieces of Norse material buried at the sites of early Indian or Eskimo camps. While Eskimos lived in northern Greenland, there is no evidence of trading by them or by Indians in the southern part of the island until after the Norse had settled there. Anthropologists cannot be sure if the artifacts indicate the extent of Norse travels in North America, or if many of them reached the native populations through trade networks many times removed from the original Norse sources.</p>
        <p>Archeologists suspect this is how a Norse penny minted in about 1065 came to be in the remains of an Indian camp at Blue Hill Bay near Brooklin , Me. Dr. Bruce J. Bourque, archeologist at the Maine State Museum in Augusta, said that since no other Norse artifacts were found at the site, the assumption was made that the penny reached the site through trade with other Indians from the north. There is no telling how many Indian hands it had passed through or how many hundreds of miles it had traveled after it had left a Norse pocket. The coin is perforated as if it had been used as a pendant. Penny Called Authentic</p>
        <p>As a specialist in Norse archeology, Dr. Bourque has examined many faked artifacts, including inscribed stones being passed off as ancient Norse runes where the symbols were so freshly scratched that dust remained in the lines. But he and other experts who examined the penny proclaimed its authenticity. Further excavations at the site are being proposed to look for more clues to the penny's provenance.</p>
        <p>Even if the coin is only indirect evidence of Norse activity, archeologists said it showed that they were still traveling to North America in the late 11th century, or even later. The scattering of other artifacts, Dr. Wallace said, is important evidence that the Norse in Greenland maintained trade and other contact with North America for almost 500 years.</p>
        <p>They apparently had their longest and most active contact with aboriginal people known as the Thule Eskimos. In the Thule village sites on Ellesmere Island in the high Arctic, Dr. Peter Schledermann, an archeologist at the University of Calgary, has picked up fragments of chain mail armor, pieces of woolen cloth, knife blades of smelted iron, iron boat rivets and other iron and copper pieces.</p>
        <p>On Baffin Island, explorers have found iron and bronze objects thought to be Norse and a figurine carved in the Eskimo style. It depicts someone dressed in a long robe slit up the front and with a cross incised on the chest. The costume resembles no known Eskimo clothing and is more like a cloaked bishop of the Norse period. Travels to Eastern Arctic</p>
        <p>"It's definitely a native carving by someone who had seen a Norseman or had one described," Dr. Fitzhugh said. "From these artifacts it does seem the Norse were more heavily involved in the eastern Arctic than indicated in the sagas, which mention only a few voyages."</p>
        <p>Dr. Fitzhugh is studying the 16th-century camps of the English navigator Martin Frobisher, who made a vain search for a possible Northwest Passage across the Arctic to Asia. Among the strangest remains at the site, on Frobisher Bay, are some loaf-shaped iron ingots. They are a mystery because carbon dating indicates that they were smelted hundreds of years before one of Frobisher's expeditions. The Indians and Eskimos presumably lacked the skill to make them. Perhaps the Norse made the ingots and Frobisher found them. No one knows.</p>
        <p>Though claims have been made for Norse expeditions as far south as the Chesapeake Bay or even Florida, most experts doubt that they ever ranged south of the Canadian Maritime Provinces or had anything to do with an enigmatic stone tower in Newport, R.I. The tower has some similarities to Norse buildings, prompting local legends, but scholars believe it goes back no further than the 17th century.</p>
        <p>Investigation of the Newport Tower is one of seven research projects being supported by Mr. Siemonsen, the Danish businessman, who has sailed some of the Norse routes and says he wants to sort out fact from fantasy in the legends. New tests developed in Finland, he said, may make it possible to establish the age of the mortar and plaster in the tower.</p>
        <p>Other new research includes an examination of well-preserved timbers from a Norse farmstead excavated in Greenland two years ago. Determining the type and age of the timber could yield its source, which could possibly be the forests of Labrador.</p>
        <p>Scientists at the University of Copenhagen and the Danish Geological Survey are analyzing coal found at another Greenland site. It is a type of anthracite coal unknown in Greenland, Iceland or Norway. Comparisons are being made to see if it might have come from Wales or even Rhode Island or Pennsylvania.</p>
        <p>In more than two decades of study, Dr. McGovern has identified several factors contributing to the decline of the Norse in Greenland and to the west. The Greenland colony never developed the economic strength to support itself or the American outposts, and Norway's interest diminished as it developed more ties with Europe.</p>
        <p>"Norse who wanted a new life could try Normandy, Sicily, Northumberland, Ireland or Vinland," Dr. McGovern noted. "Which would you choose?"</p>
        <p>The coming of the Little Ice Age in the late 14th century brought a sharp climate change that was probably devastating to the Norse farms and livestock on Greenland, as well as Vinland if they were still in operation.  While the Eskimos spread and prospered as hunters, Dr. McGovern said, the Norse failed to adapt to the chill. They were "nailed down with their investment in domestic animals and a more sedentary medieval European society," he said. They also suffered because they never developed a harpoon for seal hunting, as had the Eskimos. This limited them to hunting only certain species in certain seasons.</p>
        <p>"It's not impossible to imagine," Dr. McGovern remarked, "that the Norse presence was ending at the very time Columbus was setting sail in 1492."</p>
