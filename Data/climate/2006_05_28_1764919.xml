        <p>IN just a couple of weeks, swarms of uninvited guests -- mosquitoes -- will be showing up at backyard barbecues and other outdoor gatherings. Here, then, are some strategies for dealing with one of nature's most annoying pests.</p>
        <p>Barrier treatments -- pesticides sprayed on grass and shrubbery to kill mosquitoes before they get to your deck or patio -- are one option, said Joe Conlon, the technical adviser to the American Mosquito Control Association in Mount Laurel, N.J.</p>
        <p>''But if you put down a barrier treatment, there a few things to keep in mind,'' Mr. Conlon said. For example, some people are uncomfortable using pesticides of any kind, he said, and are even more concerned about spraying them because breezes can distribute them in unexpected ways.</p>
        <p>''And there's always the issue of chemical trespass,'' Mr. Conlon said, referring to the possibility that pesticides sprayed on your property could end up on your neighbor's. ''Unless you know your neighbor is O.K. with what you're doing, it's always best to ask.''</p>
        <p>While barrier treatments will kill mosquitoes that come in contact with the pesticides, a good rain will usually wash them away.</p>
        <p>Mr. Conlon said that while sprays will kill mosquitoes in grass and shrubbery, they will not reach very high into trees. ''So if you're worried about West Nile virus,'' he said, ''a barrier treatment isn't going to work because the mosquitoes that carry West Nile rest in the tops of trees.''</p>
        <p>Machines that control mosquitoes are becoming increasingly popular. They use combinations of carbon dioxide, heat and chemical attractants to mimic warm-blooded animals, luring blood-hungry biting females mosquitoes to the machine. Once there, they meet their end.</p>
        <p>The Skeeter Vac, for example, has a built-in vacuum that sucks in the mosquitoes and a sticky trap to capture them. The Mosquito Magnet also uses a vacuum but traps the insects in an internal net, where they die of dehydration.</p>
        <p>''The CO2-based machines are very good,'' Mr. Conlon said, ''provided they're positioned properly.'' That means placing the machine between the area to be protected and the area the mosquitoes are coming from.</p>
        <p>Another strategy is known as ''area control.'' Citronella candles are one inexpensive method many people use. ''They are only mildly repellent, and they aren't much better than any other candle,'' Mr. Conlon said. Another method is to use a product like ThermaCell, a small butane canister that heats a pesticide, which under ideal conditions will provide protection 15 feet away for 12 hours.</p>
        <p>What about bug zappers, which use ultraviolet light to attract mosquitoes and an electric grid to zap them?</p>
        <p>''Worse than worthless,'' Mr. Conlon said, explaining that while the devices do kill insects, most are not mosquitoes but species like June beetles and moths that are food for birds.</p>
        <p>Scott Crans, a mosquito expert at Rutgers University, said that the best way to keep from being bitten by a mosquito is to prevent it from being born in the first place.</p>
        <p>''You have to get rid of any standing water on your property,'' Mr. Crans said, explaining that since mosquito eggs need moisture to hatch, eliminating water is critical. ''You have to find and dump out all the things that hold water,'' he said.</p>
        <p>What can't be emptied -- ornamental ponds, for example -- can be made hostile to mosquitoes. Products like Mosquito Dunks, which can be added to standing water, will kill mosquito larvae after they hatch.</p>
        <p>The last line of defense against mosquitoes, of course, is a repellent applied to the body or to clothing. ''DEET is the way to go,'' Mr. Crans said, referring to the chemical found in more than 200 repellents. ''A concentration of around 30 percent is about all you need.''</p>
