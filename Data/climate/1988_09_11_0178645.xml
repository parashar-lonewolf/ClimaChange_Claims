        <p>LEAD: I'VE spoken to quite a few people lately who, like me, spend their days in an office. Even through the heat, they seem to recall fondly the days when employment commitments hinged on the summer season, and no job was too good to quit.</p>
        <p>I'VE spoken to quite a few people lately who, like me, spend their days in an office. Even through the heat, they seem to recall fondly the days when employment commitments hinged on the summer season, and no job was too good to quit.</p>
        <p>They look with longing at the grounds crews going to work in the morning and say, ''Boy, I'd sure love to finish the day and be able to see the results of my work, have a tan, and be sore from using my body instead of cranky from abusing my mind,'' or some such. Well, hold on just a minute here. Having worked quite a few summer jobs and having liked practically none of them enough for a repeat performance, I'd like to remind us all of how horrid the Great Outdoors can be.</p>
        <p>Housepainting: I'll say this about painting houses: It's a great way to become familiar with the state's insect population.</p>
        <p>Budding entomologists should definitely spend at least 100 days a year 30 feet up on a ladder fencing with whiteface hornets with a brush full of latex paint. It's a dynamite chance to see behavioral patterns up close. Aspiring gymnasts will relish the opportunity to fall from great heights to ascertain just how resilient their bodies are.</p>
        <p>But keep in mind that if you're working ''under the table'' and injure yourself, your boss will probably zip you into a body bag, dump you at the edge of the client's property, and whistle his way back to the job. This may seem callous, but we all know the labor pool of housepainters is vast, very vast.</p>
        <p>Worst housepainting experience: At 8:20 A.M., 20 feet up on a ladder leaning against a huge Avon Colonial, I pry back a shutter and disturb a bat from its beauty sleep. It flaps smelly, leathery wings in my face and screeches off, leaving me clutching at the ladder.</p>
        <p>Landscaping: There are two subdisciplines of this form of labor. There's the kind of landscaping where men can look through little telescopes on tripods, call out, ''A little to the left!'' and then confer at roadside with cronies to discuss what's for lunch.</p>
        <p>This seems relatively agreeable to me, but I was involved in what's known as landscraping. This generally entails picking up cigarette butts in parking lots and similarly challenging tasks like spreading gravel, cleaning gutters and, my own favorite, moving big rocks.</p>
        <p>Another thing to keep in mind is that most landscaping bosses are what I call ''verb the noun'' supervisors. They confine their commands to three words, as in, ''Rake the leaves,'' or ''Mow the lawn,'' or ''Move the truck.'' There's little preamble and no jocularity. No wonder landscaping crews drink so much beer - their humors are crying out for a little levity.</p>
        <p>Worst landscaping experience: While hard at work raking a lawn in East Windsor, I puncture an underground nest of some stinging insects with wings and foul dispositions. Final score: Insects, 8; Landscraper, 0.</p>
        <p>Camp Counselor: Any high school student considering teen-age pregnancy should spend one summer supervising a cabal of 8 to 11 children in the 8-to-11 age range. This alone would reduce the population explosion in America and substantially augment the efforts of Planned Parenthood.</p>
        <p>Ah, but there are transcendent moments in working with kids. They display moments of such incredible honesty and directness. Like the son of a Hartford Whaler I supervised in Avon, who, during one summer, was responsible for 17 sutures, 5 bloody noses and several crushing body checks dealt to fellow campers during games like ''Duck, Duck, Goose.''</p>
        <p>Worst camp counselor experience: Working through a walloping hangover one blistering July morning at Sycamore Hills Park, the head counselor suddenly decides to officially make that Tuesday ''Noisemaker Day,'' and passes out toy cymbals, horns, and rattles to all the boys and girls.</p>
        <p>Lifeguard: O.K., perhaps spending a summer getting brown and watching women smooth coconut oil on themselves merits some envy, but the limited experience I've had with other lifeguards only taught me to say the word ''Walk!'' with such emphasis it could stop a charging rhino in its tracks.</p>
        <p>Clients and business associates, I've found, react unfavorably to this kind of communication. Then, too, there is the matter of our degenerating ozone layer. Remember that the deeply darkened faces of this summer's lifeguards may resemble catchers' mitts by the turn of the century.</p>
        <p>Worst lifeguarding experience: A crew shows up at the pool to remove a large patch of poison ivy. However, they elect to burn it out, and the resulting smoke afflicts half the staff's respiratory systems with a choking rash, rendering them sick and wheezing without pay for 10 days.</p>
        <p>There are other hot-weather semi-professions not covered above: caddying, driveway sealing, greenskeeping . . . the list plods on like an August afternoon. But during this sweltering, humid summer, let us of the climate control set count our blessings and invoke the name of the gentleman who invented Freon, whoever and wherever he may be.</p>
