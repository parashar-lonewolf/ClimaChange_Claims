        <p>LEAD: A survey of streams in the Eastern United States by the Environmental Protection Agency shows that the acidification of fresh water is much more widespread than was previously known.</p>
        <p>A survey of streams in the Eastern United States by the Environmental Protection Agency shows that the acidification of fresh water is much more widespread than was previously known.</p>
        <p>A draft report on the survey said that there was a significant number of acidified streams in the Middle Atlantic coastal plain stretching from New Jersey to North Carolina, particularly in the Chesapeake Bay and New Jersey areas, and in the northern Appalachian plateau of West Virginia, Pennsylvania and New York.</p>
        <p>The report said about 4.4 percent of the 66,000 miles of stream in the Middle Atlantic survey area were acidic and roughly half of the streams in the area were found to have a potentially low capacity to neutralize acid rain.</p>
        <p>The survey was based on a sample of about 500 streams and was made available to The New York Times by agency officials. Broader Effect Than Realized E.P.A. officials noted that the survey was not designed to establish a cause-and-effect relationship between acid rain caused by pollution from coal-burning power plants and other industrial sources and the acid content of streams in the East. But several key officials said the results of the survey were a clear indication that the damage acid rain causes to surface waters was being seen in large parts of the Eastern United States.</p>
        <p>''What we are seeing here is a fully documented, statistically designed survey showing a broader geographical extent of environmental effects from acid rain than we previously realized,'' said Courtney Riordan, director of the Office of Environmental Processes and Effects Research.</p>
        <p>He added that finding over 4 percent of the streams ar acidic in the Middle Atlantic region was significant because ''we could be in a dynamic situation - we may be just at the tip of what is going to happen.''</p>
        <p>The survey found relatively few acidified streams in the Southeast. But it also found that half the streams in that area had a low alkaline content, making them susceptible to future problems.</p>
        <p>Previous surveys by the agency found serious acidification only in several hundred lakes in New York State's Adirondack Mountains and in parts of New England. The damage to the lakes there was widely attributed to acid rain caused chiefly by air pollution traveling from as far away as the Midwest.</p>
        <p>Acid rain consists chiefly of oxides of sulfur and nitrogen emitted by coal-burning power plants, smelters, factories and motor vehicles.</p>
        <p>These oxides are changed chemically in the atmosphere and fall to earth as acidic rain, snow, fog or dust. Many scientists believe that acid rain is destroying plant and animal life in sensitive bodies of fresh water and that it may also play a role in damaging forests, man-made structures and perhaps human health. States Downwind Seek Relief</p>
        <p>Eastern states downwind from the big coal-burning power plants of the Midwest, as well as environmentalists, have been asking for mandatory reductions in sulfur and nitrogen pollution through the use of devices that scrub the air to remove the pollution at the plant or through the use of coal with a lower sulfur content. But industry, the Midwestern states and the Reagan Administration have opposed such mandatory controls, contending that they would involve spending billions of dollars without complete knowledge of the causes and effects of acid rain.</p>
        <p>Amendments to the Clean Air Act, including changes that would require a major effort to reduce acid raid, are pending in the House and Senate. Environmentalists said that the new E.P.A. report on the acidification of Eastern streams underscores the need for mandatory controls to reduce the pollution that causes acid rain.</p>
        <p>But Robert A. Beck, assistant director for environment and fossil fuels at the Edison Electric Institute, an association of investor-owned electric utility companies, said that the new study did not demonstrate any need for legislation to control pollution from power plants or other sources.</p>
