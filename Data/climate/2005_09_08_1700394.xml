        <p>New York State, along with 14 other states and New York City, sued the United States Department of Energy yesterday for failing to comply with a federal law requiring tougher efficiency standards for 22 home appliances.</p>
        <p>The Energy Department is 6 to 13 years behind the schedules outlined in the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act of 1987, which was passed by Congress to increase the efficiency of furnaces, dishwashers and other household products so that they use less oil, natural gas and electricity.</p>

        <p>New York State, along with 14 other states and New York City, sued the United States Department of Energy yesterday for failing to comply with a federal law requiring tougher efficiency standards for 22 home appliances.</p>
        <p>The Energy Department is 6 to 13 years behind the schedules outlined in the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act of 1987, which was passed by Congress to increase the efficiency of furnaces, dishwashers and other household products so that they use less oil, natural gas and electricity.</p>
        <p>The department has established efficiency standards for refrigerators, clothes washers and a handful of other items, but it has missed the mandated deadlines for 22 major appliances and household products.</p>
        <p>At a news conference yesterday morning, Attorney General Eliot Spitzer of New York, who led the suit, said inertia at the Energy Department and ''industry opposition over time'' were the main reasons for the delays.</p>
        <p>''This is an effort to ensure that the Department of Energy does what it has been statutorily mandated to do, which is to revise and strengthen appliance efficiency standards,'' Mr. Spitzer said, referring to the suit. ''We view this as not only good energy policy, good environmental policy, but law enforcement.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Spitzer, a Democrat who is running for governor, insisted that the timing of the suit had nothing to do with partisan politics, and he observed that both parties are represented in the list of states.</p>
        <p>Rather, Mr. Spitzer said, record-high oil and gas prices as well as the impact of global warming have made energy savings more important than ever.</p>
        <p>Michael A. Cardozo, New York City's chief lawyer, said in a statement that forcing the Energy Department to revise efficiency standards ''will benefit the city's residents and businesses in terms of both energy costs and air quality.''</p>
        <p>Craig A. Stevens, an Energy Department spokesman, would not comment on the specifics of the suit but he insisted that the agency had been a leader in promoting energy efficiency.</p>
        <p>''While the regulatory process is long and arduous, the department has engaged in an aggressive effort to promote the use and development of energy-efficient appliances and provide incentives for their production and purchase,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The energy bill recently signed by President Bush contains efficiency standards for many more appliances, including ceiling fans. Mr. Stevens said that despite the current backlog, the department would work to meet the new standards concurrently with the old ones.</p>
        <p>Appliance manufacturers said that consumer appliances have become far more efficient even without the federal standards, in part because of voluntary national efforts like the Energy Star program, which makes efficient products easily recognizable.</p>
        <p>''I don't think any of us could claim that more could not have been done,'' said Charles A. Samuels, general counsel of the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, an industry group. ''But it is a misrepresentation to make it look like there has been a miserable administration of standards.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Samuels said that sometimes there were good reasons for missing the Congressional deadlines. For example, he said, government officials and manufacturers agreed that the higher standard for clothes dryers did not have to be met after new, efficient washers left laundry so dry that it needed less time in a dryer.</p>
        <p>''In that sense, somebody could say that the law was violated,'' Mr. Samuels said, ''but in the sense of good public policy that is supported by everybody it was exactly the right thing to do.''</p>
        <p>Katherine Kennedy, a senior lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council, said, however, that there was no public participation in the decision over the standard for dryers.</p>
        <p>The other states taking part are California, Connecticut, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Wisconsin.</p>
