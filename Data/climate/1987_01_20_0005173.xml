        <p>LEAD: Twice as much airborne pollution is deposited above 3,000 feet in the Appalachian Mountains as in lowland areas, two Yale University geochemists have found. Dr. William C. Graustein, an associate research scientist, and Dr. Karl K. Turekian, chairman of geology and geophysics, also found that 40 percent to 60 percent of the pollutants came from the lowest layer of the atmosphere and were, therefore, more likely to be deposited within 50 miles to 100 miles of where they originated.</p>

        <p>Twice as much airborne pollution is deposited above 3,000 feet in the Appalachian Mountains as in lowland areas, two Yale University geochemists have found. Dr. William C. Graustein, an associate research scientist, and Dr. Karl K. Turekian, chairman of geology and geophysics, also found that 40 percent to 60 percent of the pollutants came from the lowest layer of the atmosphere and were, therefore, more likely to be deposited within 50 miles to 100 miles of where they originated.</p>
        <p>Scientists have suspected that mountain forests are vulnerable to damage by air pollution because they are frequently shrouded in ground-hugging clouds. The Yale researchers believe they are the first to determine the rate at which pollutants are deposited from these clouds.</p>
        <p>Dr. Graustein said their findings provided a ''better understanding of the physics of the transfer of materials from the atmosphere to the ground,'' that could be useful to researchers seeking solutions to industrial pollution such as acid rain.</p>
        <p>The researchers based their conclusions, published recently in the Journal of Geophysical Research, on a technique they developed that uses a radioactive tracer to measure how quickly fine pollution particles reach the ground from various levels of the atmosphere. They sampled air and soil from 32 sites from Texas to Wyoming and from North Carolina to Maine.</p>
        <p>Acid rain forms when water in the atmosphere condenses on particles containing acid-forming pollutants, such as sulfate produced by the burning of fossil fuels and nitrogen oxides from automobile exhausts. It falls to the earth as sulfuric or nitric acid. Acid rain has been linked to widespread forest damage and destruction of fish in lakes in parts of North America and Europe.</p>
