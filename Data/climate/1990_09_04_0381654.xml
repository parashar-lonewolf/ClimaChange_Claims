        <p>LEAD: IN a finding that could force a revision of ideas about how theearth's ancient climate system worked, scientists have concluded that the great North American ice sheets of the last 120,000 years behaved much more dynamically than has been thought, with towering mountains of ice migrating 600 miles or more across eastern Canada.</p>
        <p>But now, by analyzing satellite images of telltale sediment ridges left by the movement of the ice, glaciologists at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland have found that the big domes, some of them rising 2.5 miles, were highly mobile.</p>
        <p>Their movements probably changed the pattern of prevailing winds, said Dr. Geoffrey S. Boulton, who, along with Dr. Christopher D. Clark, conducted the study, which is reported in the current issue of the British journal Nature.</p>
        <p>Dr. Boulton said the wind-pattern change was linked to global climate changes, and the climatic changes in their turn probably stimulated further movement in the ice domes.</p>
        <p>''We draw the inference that this fluctuation in the centers of mass can only be an indication of the sensitive reaction that went on between the atmosphere and the ice sheets,'' said Dr. Boulton. A relatively small change in temperature could touch off movement of the ice masses, he said, ''and this instability is passed around the whole earth.''</p>
        <p>The precise linkages of cause-and-effect that led to the climatic changes are not clear, since scientists are still trying to understand the complicated network of feedbacks that characterize the global climate system.</p>
        <p>The findings of Dr. Boulton and Dr. Clark constitute ''a brand new concept'' that could bring about a reassessment of the climatic role of the Laurentide ice sheet and that is ''sure to bring up a lot of controversy,'' said Dr. George H. Denton of the University of Maine, an expert who reviewed the report for publication in Nature.</p>
        <p>The ice sheet itself, said Dr. Boulton, was the ''principal governor'' of the timing and magnitude of global climate change. ''What we'll probably find,'' he said, ''is that other ice sheets around the world resonated to the Laurentide beat.''</p>
        <p>Glaciologists and climatologists know climate is shaped by the interaction of the sun, the atmosphere, the oceans and ice, and they have relied heavily on studies of the ancient climate in seeking to learn how climate functions in general.</p>
        <p>''If we can understand those workings on a long-term scale,'' said Dr. Boulton, ''that's probably part of the key to understanding short-term changes.''</p>
        <p>If the movement of the ice sheets can be accurately reflected in computerized models that scientists use to analyze ancient climate, ''then we may also approach problems concerning the future effects of possible global warming on modern ice sheets and, hence, sea level with increased confidence,'' Dr. Julian A. Dowdeswell of the Scott Polar Research Institute at Cambridge University in England, said in a commentary accompanying the report in Nature.</p>
        <p>Previously, scientists postulated that a static dome or domes in the Laurentian ice sheet caused the west-to-east North American jet stream to split, with the northern half of the stream causing arctic air to cascade onto the North Atlantic, cooling it. This, they believe, was associated with changes in ocean circulation and with the production of heat-trapping carbon dioxide and heat-reflecting aerosols by oceanic organisms.</p>
        <p>Scientists say all these interactions and feedback effects are regulated by periodic changes in the angle of the earth's axis and the shape of its orbit and by wobbles in the planet's rotation. These alter the intensity of solar radiation reaching the earth and the angles from which it strikes the surface. The atmosphere, the oceans and ice amplify and modulate these changes. In this way, Dr. Boulton says, ice largely controlled the long-term tempo of the ancient climatic system.</p>
        <p>The changes in solar radiation, relatively speaking, ''are beating very hard, very fast,'' he said, ''but the ice sheet is responding very slowly. It's the slower responses that determine the time scale and the magnitude of climatic change.''</p>
        <p>If the big Laurentide ice domes were as mobile as Dr. Boulton and Dr. Clark say, their key role in the broader climate picture may have been different from what scientists have believed. The domes' changing location could have produced changing effects on the jet stream and different effects on the ocean.</p>
        <p>Dr. Denton raises questions as to whether the domes as described by Dr. Boulton and Dr. Clark would have been high enough to affect the jet stream. Dr. Boulton says that at 2.5 miles, they would have done so.</p>
        <p>According to the Boulton-Clark analysis, a big ice dome formed and began growing about 115,000 years ago northwest of Hudson Bay. Moving southeast, it joined with another center of mass migrating up from Labrador. They fused into a larger ridge running from northwest to southeast across Hudson Bay. This merged mass coincided with a major period of glaciation 100,000 years ago.</p>
        <p>The western part of this sheet disintegrated, and a remaining dome moved eastward to Labrador. About 60,000 years ago, another dome appeared northwest of Hudson Bay. Both grew, and by 20,000 years ago they had merged into another ridge across Hudson Bay. This one coincided with the depth of the last ice age. By 10,000 years ago, the ridge had split again into two domes moving away from each other. By 8,000 years ago the rapidly shrinking domes were separated by all of Hudson Bay.</p>
        <p>Huge Domes of Ice</p>
        <p>Highly mobile masses of ice may have contributed to changes in the world's climate by diverting wind patterns. An ice dome, which emerged near the Hudson Bay, migrated southwest to join another from Labrador 100,000 years ago, the time of a major period of glaciation. Around 20,000 years ago, two domes merged across Hudson Bay, coinciding with the last ice age. They separated 10,000 years ago.</p>
