        <p>While city workers passed out 1,500 honey locust seedlings today in small plastic bags, schoolchildren, politicians and officials gathered downtown in fog and drizzle for Chicago's annual celebration of trees.</p>
        <p>A bake sale and poster contest, speeches and poetry all marked Arbor Day, celebrated in most states on the fourth Friday of April.</p>
        <p>It used to be among the minor constellations of observances, its rituals seldom practiced beyond elementary school or state capitols' lawns. But this year, with deforestation and global warming and the greenhouse effect and drought, planting trees seems more urgent.</p>
        <p>''Planting trees and protecting trees that are already planted can help,'' said Mary Yager, the program coordinator for the National Arbor Day Foundation, alluding to the greenhouse effect in which a buildup of gases in the atmosphere traps heat at ground level. Green-Up Time in Wisconsin</p>
        <p>In Wisconsin, Gov. Tommy G. Thompson urged planting a million trees this week to replace those lost in the drought and forest fires last year. In one project, 130 seventh grade students from Shawano, Wisc., planted 5,000 seedlings in an area burned out by a forest fire last summer.</p>
        <p>In New Jersey, there were tree-planting ceremonies in 37 communities marking Arbor Day, and in New York trees were planted on the grounds of the Governor's Mansion and in a park at Binghamton.</p>
        <p>It all began in Nebraska in 1872. A newspaper publisher, J. Sterling Morton, argued with some passion that planting trees would not only enrich the state's soil but restore its moisture. A Great Oak's Descendant</p>
        <p>A volunteer group in Chicago, Neighborwoods, has planted more than 800 trees on vacant lots and empty city land since it began two years ago.</p>
        <p>On Friday, in a ceremony at a Roman Catholic high school, Neighborwoods planted a 6-foot sapling that is a direct descendant of the Stelmuze, a 2,000-year-old, 30-foot-wide English Oak in Lithuania that is revered as a national monument.</p>
        <p>''Trees in general are getting to be a very hot issue, pardon the pun, because of the greenhouse effect,'' said Edith Makra, the founder of Neighborwoods.</p>
