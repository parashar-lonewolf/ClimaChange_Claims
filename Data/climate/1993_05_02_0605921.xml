        <p>OCCIDENTAL, Calif. -- Nibbling his "Cranberry Gobbler" sandwich in a sunny cafe, Terence McKenna explained his theory of how psychedelic mushrooms are the missing link in the story of human evolution.

        <p>OCCIDENTAL, Calif. -- Nibbling his "Cranberry Gobbler" sandwich in a sunny cafe, Terence McKenna explained his theory of how psychedelic mushrooms are the missing link in the story of human evolution. About five million years ago, Mr. McKenna said, our remote ancestors left the African rain forest for what were the verdant Saharan grasslands. In search of protein-rich grubs and beetles, they flipped over dried cow pies and discovered the dung-loving psilocybin mushroom.</p>
        <p>"For sure the mushroom would have been sampled," Mr. McKenna said. "Then our proto-hominid forebears, like legions of hippies millennia hence, discovered that the usual activities comprising the whirl of their days -- hunting and gathering, primarily -- were out of the question.</p>
        <p>"You are just simply nailed to the ground and you experience the bewildering phenomenon that we call the hallucinogenic experience, which even post-Husserl, post-Merleau-Ponty, post-everything, we don't know what to make of," he said. "It laid the basis, I think, for religion and for language."</p>
        <p>This was some earful to hear over lunch in the pleasant, slow-moving town of Occidental. Like other communities in the cathedral-like redwood groves north of San Francisco, the town has become a haven for counterculture types, both graying heads from the 60's and younger neo-hippies of the 90's. A local bulletin board advertises "Environmentally Conscious Tree Care" and "Christie's Not-So-Toxic Housekeeping Service."</p>
        <p>Yet, Mr. McKenna is not just another zoned-out, aging Deadhead. He makes his claims for psychedelic drugs in tightly reasoned, copiously footnoted books that exhibit a wide learning in fields ranging from philosophy to quantum mechanics to natural science. Magic mushrooms as the missing link is only one of many seemingly preposterous notions he promotes with beguiling logic, albeit with a definite lack of hard evidence.</p>
        <p>After wandering for years in the cultural outback of the New Age -- a movement he deplores for its guru worship and abandonment of rationalism -- Mr. McKenna is beginning to be more widely heard. Three books have been published in the last year, and two more are on the way. His charismatic lecture style, a product of what he calls his "innate Irish ability to rave," pulls in audiences of up to 3,000 in Los Angeles and New York, seemingly equal mixes of psychonauts, cyberpunks and slightly befuddled mycologists.</p>
        <p>Mr. McKenna has a significant following in the youthful rave culture, where dancers pulsating to a dreamy techno beat often choose to chemically alter their consciousness. His latest book, "True Hallucinations" (HarperCollins, 1993), was launched in February not with a book signing but with an all-night rave in San Francisco. The English techno band the Shamen recently sampled one of Mr. McKenna's lecture-hall raps and hit No. 5 on the Top of the Pops.</p>
        <p>"This under-25 group is a little different from the wannabe yuppie generation of the 80's," Mr. McKenna said.</p>
        <p>"They have the same kind of alienation that immediately preceded the hippie outbreak in the 60's. It's a feeling of being marginalized by the system. Apparently, if a generation can't find inclusion in the culture, then it becomes narcissistic, with all the positive and negative connotations that brings."</p>
        <p>With piercing deep-set eyes and a scraggly beard, Mr. McKenna has a cheerfully demonic look. His countenance bears weary witness to the utter strangeness of what he claims to have discovered in 25 years of imbibing "heroic doses" of hallucinogens. Now 46, he first tried psychedelics in the mid-60's in Berkeley, Calif. But unlike most of his generation, who buried their acid trips in a file marked Unidentified Youthful Indulgences, Mr. McKenna doggedly followed through.</p>
        <p>For more than two decades he has hitchhiked around the galaxy on the back of the magic mushroom. Today, he'll tell an audience that hallucinogenic drugs prove "that right here and now, one quanta away, there is raging a universe of active intelligence that is transhuman, hyperdimensional, and extremely alien."</p>
        <p>Whatever else he is, Mr. McKenna is a sure sign that Reagan-Bushism is dead and in the ground, and that a wilder social moment may be upon us.</p>
        <p>His speaking style is a perfect synthesis of message and medium, an aural reconstruction of psychedelic experience. His voice is trancelike and sing-songy. Free-associating his way through intellectual history, he caroms between references to "Finnegans Wake," Heraclitus, a scene with the Munchkins in "The Wizard of Oz" and the writings of the neo-Platonist Philo Judaeus.</p>
        <p>The cosmic giggle ripples through Mr. McKenna's spiels as if to make palatable the sheer weirdness of what he has to say. One thing he argues is that the psilocybin mushroom,</p>
        <p>Stropharia cubensis</p>
        <p>, is no ordinary life form, no lowly fungus, but in fact the megaphone used by an alien, intergalactic Other to communicate with mankind.</p>
        <p>"The distinguishing characteristic about psilocybin," he told a San Francisco audience recently, "is that it speaks to you -- it speaks to you in English. This is extraordinary."</p>
        <p>His bone-dry delivery provoked laughter. The crowd was mostly hirsute forty-somethings, like the characters in a Koren cartoon. They wore layers of loose natural-fiber clothing, like Mr. McKenna himself, who was dressed in a baggy chenille sweater.</p>
        <p>Mr. McKenna's appearance coincided with a weekendlong celebration in San Francisco and Santa Cruz of the 50th anniversary of the discovery of LSD. About 1,000 people attended seminars like "Women in Psychedelics" and "Sacred and Healing Plants." Rain canceled what might have been the most colorful event: a bicycle parade to mark history's first LSD trip, when the Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann ingested the drug in his laboratory and pedaled home erratically on his bicycle.</p>
        <p>Among those attending, it was virtually an article of faith that more LSD is manufactured and used today than during the 60's. Indeed, a recent survey for the National Institute on Drug Abuse found that while drug use was declining among high school seniors, the sole exception was LSD, which was on a slow upward trend.</p>
        <p>A major distinction between current and 60's users is that the original counterculture talked incessantly about psychedelics, feeding a sense of national crisis, whereas current users have been much more discreet. The silence, however, is being broken as Mr. McKenna emerges as the most forceful advocate for psychedelics since Timothy Leary.</p>
        <p>"He's an eloquent and imaginative poet of the psychedelic experience," said Mr. Leary, an unabashed admirer, who is already on record calling Mr. McKenna "the Timothy Leary of the 90's." "He combines ancient wisdom with Irish wit."</p>
        <p>Mr. McKenna disapproves of taking hallucinogens, which remain illegal, for mere recreational purposes. He advocates they be taken in dark and quiet places in a spirit of exploration, in doses high enough to "flatten the most resistant ego."</p>
        <p>Mr. McKenna's claims for hallucinogens go way beyond Leary, Aldous Huxley or any of his predecessors. He maintains that magic mushrooms are a conduit to "the Gaian mind" of the planet, the collective voice of the earth as ecosystem. What the mushroom says, he says, is that the planet is in mortal peril. Something must be done! And psychedelics are the way forward. Not just any psychedelics, but the tryptamine family of plant hallucinogens that include psilocybin, DMT and ayahuasca, the traditional vision-quest drink of South American shamen.</p>
        <p>Mr. McKenna says these drugs recall for users a state of mind he believes was once universal during an era when people lived in orgiastic, goddess-worshiping societies. Borrowing a page from feminist revisionist historians, he says such societies existed 14,000 years ago during the "high paleolithic," before the corrupting rise of agriculture, monotheism and male kingships -- "the whole menu of bum institutions which lead to the present day."</p>
        <p>As sketched in his book "Food of the Gods" (Bantam, 1992), Mr. McKenna theorizes it was hallucinogenic plants in the diet that kept our high paleolithic forebears living the groovy life of sexual egalitarianism and harmony with nature. But then, due to climatic changes, the hallucinogenic plants disappeared. To regain the paganistic Eden and divert the earth from its present course of ecological disaster, we must, he says, restore hallucinogens to regular use.</p>
        <p>In a nutshell, this is Mr. McKenna's update of the psychedelic revolution: tune in, turn on, save the ozone layer. To many, he appeals simply because he is such a hoot. "Our dilemma," Mr. McKenna said with pranksterish wit, "is that halfway on the way to becoming angels we stopped taking our medication."</p>
        <p>He was seated on the floor of his Occidental apartment, a tea tray at his feet. Separated from his wife, he lives with his teen-age son, Finn, who was due in that evening from Hawaii. The big room was empty of furniture except for a reading chair. Thousands of books lined three walls from floor to ceiling.  Mr. McKenna sat near the Greek philosophy and Hellenistic religion shelves. He had Plato, the gnostics, the cabala, Appolonias of Cayenna and a seven-volume "Legends of the Jews."</p>
        <p>"I don't understand why drugs are not used as tools of research," he said. "You want to know how the atom works? Smash it and look at the pieces. You want to know how the mind works? Get it smashed and then see what the pieces are."</p>
        <p>Mr. McKenna is like a lovely psychedelic sophist. His reasoning has a seductive and seemingly learned coherence, even though it doesn't quite hold up. One wonders if he'd advocate conducting other scientific inquiries -- an atom-smashing, say -- while the observer is hallucinating. The polysyllabic sentences he lards with intellectual references are an attempt to lend credibility to the otherwise debunked subject of drugs.</p>
        <p>On occasion Mr. McKenna seems to swerve perilously into what psychologists might call delusions of grandeur. "If I'm right, you know," he said in an eerily serious voice, "you're sitting across from Newton."</p>
        <p>O BSESSIVENESS -- the perfect psychedelic temperament -- has marked his personality since he was a gangly kid in an isolated Colorado town. Even then his interests were highly arcane. He was a rabid rock hound, a budding alchemist who read Jung's "Psychology and Alchemy" at age 14 and a science-fiction fanatic.</p>
        <p>"People say marijuana is the entry drug," he said. "Science fiction is really the entry drug. Because the subtext of science fiction is release your imagination, anything can happen. To me, from science fiction to amateur rocketry to adolescent sexuality to drugs is just a broad highway."</p>
        <p>The Rosetta stone from which all of Mr. McKenna's ideas follow is a set of experiences he describes in his latest book, "True Hallucinations." It recounts a journey made in 1971 by his younger brother Dennis, a few freak friends and himself to the Amazon jungle in search of psychedelic plants. In a tiny mission settlement in southern Columbia the brothers McKenna encountered magic mushrooms for the first time. Ingesting what was no doubt a heroic dose, they triggered the ultimate trip, which lasted nearly two weeks after the effects of the actual drugs wore off.</p>
        <p>At one point, Dennis became convinced he could mentally cause any phone throughout history to ring. He placed a call to the McKennas' mother in 1953 and reached her listening to Dizzy Dean call a World Series game. She refused to believe it was Dennis on the line because she could see his 3-year-old form asleep in his bassinet.</p>
        <p>The obvious conclusion would have been that Dennis was having a bummer and had flipped his lid. Yet, Mr. McKenna rejected this answer as overly simplistic. To him, Dennis's ravings made great sense. Dennis had become, as he sees it, "psycho-topologically enmeshed" in a world beyond everyday reality, "whose unseen, cybernetic chroniclers spoke to us telepathically in our minds." The brothers, according to Mr. McKenna, had experiences with mind reading, a shamanic journey and an encounter with a U.F.O.</p>
        <p>Dennis McKenna, who went on to earn a Ph.D. in botanical science, remembers things slightly differently. "It was quite real to me, but I suppose the fantasies of a psychotic are too," he said. "As far as I can tell it was all internal."</p>
        <p>What saves Mr. McKenna's fantastic yarn from being instantly dismissible is that he himself recognizes the absurdity of what he's saying and, yet, feels compelled to say it anyway. In the same manner that he wryly recounts all his drug experiences, he brings to the tale an impassioned skepticism. Perhaps the events described don't amount to "the trigger experience for the entire human world" that even now are changing "the ontological basis of reality." But they're still a spellbinding entry in the long storytelling tradition of epic dope trips.</p>
