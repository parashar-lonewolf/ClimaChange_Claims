        <p>LEAD: Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts owes a large debt to the owners of the Seabrook nuclear plant in New Hampshire: $2 billion. That's the cost of his refusal to help his New Hampshire neighbors devise an emergency evacuation plan.</p>
        <p>Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts owes a large debt to the owners of the Seabrook nuclear plant in New Hampshire: $2 billion. That's the cost of his refusal to help his New Hampshire neighbors devise an emergency evacuation plan.</p>
        <p>The plant was ready to run in October 1986, and interest and maintenance costs have been growing at a rate of $50 million a month ever since. New Hampshire finally devised its own plan, and last week Federal regulators voted to grant an operating license.</p>
        <p>The plant will probably be running soon, but burdened with the vast costs of this pointless delay. Mr. Dukakis's office, unrepentant, says the investors knew the risks. But it's his risk estimates that were awry. He exaggerated the dangers of nuclear power, while spurning those of climatic warming.</p>
        <p>American nuclear power plants, Seabrook included, have many faults. They are too large, too expensive and too complex. Mr. Dukakis bears only part of the blame for the fact that Seabrook is 12 times over cost and 11 years behind schedule. But technology isn't wholly to blame, either. As the French have proved, plants using the basic American model can be built quickly and designed to run safely. France now uses nuclear power to produce 70 percent of its electricity.</p>
        <p>But France does not have state governors like Mr. Dukakis and New York's Mario Cuomo. Following the Three Mile Island disaster, states were required to help devise emergency escape plans. Mr. Dukakis and Mr. Cuomo used this duty as a veto.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dukakis offered the Chernobyl disaster as a reason for not cooperating on Seabrook, even though the Soviet reactor had an entirely different design. Mr. Cuomo, citing public worries over an escape plan, effectively killed the completed reactor at Shoreham, wasting a $5.5 billion asset. These policies - along with copious errors by reactor builders and utilities - have brought America's nuclear industry to stagnation. So daunting are the political prospects that newer, more efficient plants are unlikely to get off the drawing boards.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, technological leadership has passed to Japan. Construction of a new plant takes five years there, compared with 11 in the U.S. And as Japan searches busily for an advanced generation of reactors, the infrastructure required to build nuclear plants dwindles in America.</p>
        <p>Maybe the nuclear option will turn out to be a dead end. If so, Mr. Dukakis and Mr. Cuomo will have only helped speed its demise. But oil prices could rise sharply, and solar energy could take decades more to develop. The greenhouse warming of the atmosphere could then create a premium for nuclear power plants, which don't produce greenhouse gases. There would be a worldwide demand for such plants, but the U.S. may by then have frozen itself out of the market.</p>
        <p>The smarter strategy would be to keep the nuclear option open. Environmentalists are inconsistent when they press for action to avert greenhouse warming while remaining adamantly opposed to nuclear power. They recently condemned John Sununu, the White House chief of staff, for opposing swift measures against warming; yet as Governor of New Hampshire, Mr. Sununu strongly supported the Seabrook reactor.</p>
        <p>It's leaders like Governors Dukakis and Cuomo who obstruct the one kind of baseload power plant that produces no greenhouse gases. In the crowded annals of human folly, the sagas of Seabrook and Shoreham will surely rate a space.</p>
