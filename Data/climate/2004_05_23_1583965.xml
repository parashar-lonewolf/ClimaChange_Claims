        <p>Mortimer D. Turner, a prominent polar geologist who helped open the Antarctic frontier to geological exploration, died May 1 in Boulder, Colo. He was 83.</p>
        <p>The cause was a seizure, said his wife, JoAnne Church Turner.</p>
        <p>In 1959, Dr. Turner joined the National Science Foundation to help run its Antarctic research program. While there, he helped set up and oversee its polar earth sciences branch, using the position to finance and lead projects that made groundbreaking geological and paleontological discoveries in Antarctica.</p>
        <p>In 1968, Dr. Turner oversaw a drilling project that penetrated the Antarctic ice sheet and reached its base for the first time.</p>
        <p>His projects allowed scientists to study evolution, earth structure and signs of global climate change in different layers of the ice core.</p>
        <p>Born in 1920 in Greeley, Colo., Mortimer Darling Turner earned his undergraduate and master's degrees from the University of California, Berkeley, and his doctorate from the University of Kansas.</p>
        <p>Dr. Turner was a fellow emeritus at the Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research at the University of Colorado. He retired in 1984, but went on to conduct geological studies of archaeological and paleontological sites in the western United States and China.</p>
        <p>In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, Robert, of Bakersfield, Calif.; two daughters, Satia Goff of Monticello, Minn., and Ylla Romdall of Bellingham, Wash.; a stepson, Christopher Dort of Spotsylvania, Va.; six grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.</p>
