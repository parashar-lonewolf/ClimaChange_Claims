        <p>Baking Powder vs. Baking Soda  Q.  What is the difference between baking powder and baking soda? Do they lose their effectiveness over time?  A.  Baking soda is almost universally sodium bicarbonate, a tasteless, nontoxic chemical compound. Its leavening action is based on its ability to react with acids from other ingredients, neutralizing them to produce bubbles of carbon dioxide. It is very effective in batters or doughs that contain yogurt, buttermilk, sour milk or other sources of acid, including honey, molasses and chocolate.</p>
        <p>Baking powder is a combination of baking soda and an acid, such as cream of tartar. This gives the baking soda a ready source of acid to react with when a liquid is added. In a pinch, a home version of single-acting baking powder can be made by mixing a quarter-teaspoon of baking soda and three-eighths of a teaspoon of cream of tartar for roughly the equivalent of a teaspoon of baking powder. This home mixture will not store well.</p>

This home mixture will not store well.</p>
        <p>Double-acting baking powder contains baking soda and two types of acid. The first is activated by moisture and the second by heat, which  produces a finer texture.</p>
        <p>Many recipes call for both baking powder and baking soda; the additional soda makes the leavening action begin sooner.</p>
        <p>Baking powder and baking soda both have a shelf life of from six months to a year if they are properly stored, according to the Home Baking Association. Both should be stored in well-sealed containers at room temperature, away from excessive heat.</p>
        <p>To test baking powder, mix a teaspoon of powder with a third-cup of hot water. If it does not bubble actively, it should be replaced. To check baking soda, pour a few drops of lemon juice or vinegar over a half-teaspoon of soda. If it doesn't bubble actively, it is old.</p>
