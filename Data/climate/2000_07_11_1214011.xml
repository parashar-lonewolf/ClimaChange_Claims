        <p>The mythic ice scape that stretches south in all directions from the North Pole is melting so fast that Norwegian scientists say it could disappear entirely each summer beginning in just 50 years, radically altering the Earth's environment, the global economy and the human imagination.</p>
        <p>Climatologists have warned for a decade that the northern icecap is retreating. But researchers at the University of Bergen's Nansen Environmental and Remote Sensing Center are apparently the first to predict the disorienting specter of a watery North Pole open to cruise ships and the Polar Bear Swim Club within the lives of today's young people.</p>
        <p>''The changes we've seen have been much faster and more dramatic than most people imagine,'' said Tore Furevik, 31, a polar researcher and co-author of the article ''Toward an Ice-Free Arctic?'' in the latest issue of the Norwegian science journal Cicerone.</p>
        <p>Not all ice specialists agree with Mr. Furevik, but his 50-year projection is supported by the director of the Bergen research center, Prof. Ola M. Johannessen, whose own study will appear in the fall issue of Science Progress, a British journal.</p>
        <p>Professor Johannessen, 61, said the receding and thinning of Arctic sea ice have outstripped the theoretical effect of global warming from greenhouse gases by a factor of three. ''The greenhouse is here, no doubt about it, but there is more to it,'' he said, speculating that a conjunction of long-term oscillations in North Atlantic air pressure have hastened the melting. If so, he said, the cycles will eventually decouple and the ice, or what is left of it, could regain stability.</p>
        <p>Since 1978, the coverage of Arctic sea ice in winter has decreased by 6 percent, equivalent to an area the size of Texas, according to satellite pictures. As for average ice thickness in late summer, submarine sonar measurements since the 1950's have shown a decline to 5.9 feet from 10.2 feet, or 42 percent. The Norwegian researchers' prediction of zero ice in a half-century is based partly on extrapolation of the submarine data and partly on Professor Johannessen's discovery last year that hard-core, year-round ice is shrinking twice as fast as the overall winter perimeter.</p>
        <p>While an ice-free Arctic Ocean would most likely disrupt the global environment, researchers said, it could have positive economic aspects. It could shorten shipping routes, for example, and expand the range of offshore oil drillers. Rich new fishing areas would probably appear, though established fisheries to the south could decline.</p>
        <p>Dr. Drew Rothrock, a University of Washington oceanographer, said he agreed that Arctic sea ice was on a trajectory to disappear in 50 years. But, he added, that did not mean it would. The ice is being expelled from the Arctic by abnormally strong winds before it could achieve its accustomed thickness, he said, and that could be a temporary phenomenon.</p>
        <p>''I think it is quite possible that in the next 10 years we will see the winds revert to a more historical pattern, so that the ice begins to reside longer in the Arctic and thicken up again,'' he said. ''I would be cautious about predicting doom.''</p>
        <p>Unlike the ice in a pond, Arctic sea ice consists of independent floes of varying age that join together, pull apart or pile up on one another in reaction to wind and currents. In winter, it extends as far south as Hudson Bay in Canada. By late summer it pulls back to the roughly circular Arctic basin.</p>
        <p>The seeming permanence and impregnability of the northern icescape have given it almost continental status in the human imagination. As a mythic anchor point, the North Pole, home of Santa Claus, has few geographic rivals.</p>
        <p>''The North Pole is the strongest symbol of mankind's struggle against, and with, nature,'' said the Norwegian adventurer Boerge Ousland, the first man to ski there alone without aerial reprovisioning, in 1994. ''If the ice disappears, well, I just can't imagine it.''</p>
        <p>The sea ice is thickest above North America, where Canadian islands and the fingers of northern Greenland act as a sieve in the current. As the floes stack up there, they create pressure ridges up to 40 feet high. By contrast, a branch of the warm-water Gulf Stream keeps Norway's north coast ice-free. That warm flow continues under the ice along most of the northern Siberian coast.</p>
        <p>If the trend continues, it is there, the Eurasian Arctic, that the first significant opening of ice-clogged water is expected. Russia, Scandinavia and Japan are laying plans. Government ministers and shipping executives met in Oslo last fall and declared that ''considerable profit potential'' existed for a proposed shipping lane linking Western Europe and Asia across the mellowing Arctic. The Northern Sea Route is a centuries-old dream comparable to that of the Northwest Passage of Canada, which is even more solidly frozen.</p>
        <p>Ships using the Arctic to move  cargo from Hamburg, Germany, to Yokohama, Japan, would save about 4,800 miles compared with the usual route through the Suez Canal. Current traffic is limited to the Russian Navy and a handful of heavily subsidized nickel ore carriers escorted by nuclear-powered icebreakers. But receding ice could open the way for a  parade of cargo vessels and oil tankers, shipping industry experts said.</p>
        <p>A proponent of the shortcut is Ivan Ivanov, leader of an Arctic shipping  demonstration project carried out by Finland's Fortum energy company with financing from the European Commission. Citing what he called official Russian estimates, he said the Russian Arctic shelf contained three times the oil of Saudi Arabia.</p>
        <p>The vision of an industrialized Arctic Ocean alarms environmentalists, who see the dwindling of ice as a disaster. They said the loss of white surface area would cause the Arctic to reflect less of the sun's energy, accelerating the warming. On the other hand, open water makes a better ''sink'' for absorbing atmospheric greenhouse gases.</p>
        <p>Thus, according to one model, an ice-free Arctic Ocean could do as much to slow global warming as the melting did to stimulate it. Yet even a modest change in Arctic dynamics could have wrenching effects elsewhere. If the changes divert the Gulf Stream, Professor Johannessen said, much of Western Europe could be plunged into an ice age.</p>
        <p>One sure thing is that melting sea ice cannot be implicated in the coastal flooding that many global warming models have projected. Just as melting ice cubes do not cause a glass of water to overflow, melting sea ice does not increase oceanic volume. Any future rise in sea level would result from glaciers melting on land, of which there has been little evidence to date.</p>
        <p>Another sure thing is that the polar bear and other creatures face a bleak future if their habitat keeps liquefying. So do Eskimo populations that hunt game like seal and walrus. Alan Springer, a wildlife specialist at the University of Alaska in Fairbanks, said Alaska's 250,000 walruses seem to have suffered weight loss and stress from retraction of the pack ice they need for resting and raising pups.</p>
        <p>''The sea ice in summer has been receding so far north that it carries the walruses into very deep water, far from their optimal feeding ground,'' Dr. Springer said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Furevik, the Norwegian researcher, said he could foresee ice-dwelling mammals making ''a desperate last stand'' north of Greenland, where he believes the final patch of Arctic sea ice will linger before vanishing into the waves in about 2050.</p>
        <p>Correction:  July 28, 2000, Friday  A chart in Science Times on July 11 about melting Arctic ice misstated the average area covered by longstanding ice. It shrank from 1,734,898 square miles in 1978-79 to 1,503,313 in 1997-98 (not 2,792,192 to 2,419,473).</p>
