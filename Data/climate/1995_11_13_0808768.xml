        <p>EXASPERATION MARKS A FARE INCREASE</p>

        <p>EXASPERATION MARKS A FARE INCREASE</p>
        <p>Long lines at token booths, confusion over the mathematics and widespread exasperation bedeviled New York City's transit system and tens of thousands of riders as an on-again, off-again fare increase went into effect, at least temporarily. The matter goes back to Federal court tomorrow. Difficult as it was yesterday, straphanger advocates and transit officials said the real crisis was  expected with the start of the workweek as millions of subway and bus riders seeking tiny new tokens lay siege to the city's 468 subway stations. For anyone  without them, a nightmare was likely. [Page A1.]</p>
        <p>After nearly seven months of what one straphanger called the "mother of all service disruptions," subway lines over the Manhattan Bridge reopened. All B, C, D, M, N, Q and R trains went back to the way they used to be, before the bridge  imbroglio turned their lines into so much tangled spaghetti. [B3.]</p>
        <p>At the heart of the legal effort to roll back the new $1.50 transit fare is Federal civil rights legislation. But even lawyers in the case concede that the  suit is as much about politics, and whether government can be forced to be more  generous to the poor. News analysis. [B3.]</p>
        <p>Former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo used the occasion of the increase in the transit fare to lash out, for the first time since last year's bitter campaign, at the man who unseated him: Governor Pataki. [B3.]</p>
        <p>NEW YORK CITY</p>
        <p>THE TWO FACES OF A DEFEAT</p>
        <p>Guy V. Molinari's defeat in the race for district attorney, his first after two decades in politics, has Democrats seeing wider implications and Republicans insisting that the loss indicated only how much Staten Islanders wanted Mr. Molinari to remain their Borough President. The vote has energized the borough's battered Democrats, who say it shows the low currency of Mayor Giuliani's endorsement and could even signal vulnerability for Mr. Molinari's daughter, Representative Susan Molinari. But Mr. Molinari said the message was much simpler: "It seems that more than anything, the voters of Staten Island thought  I was doing a great job as Borough President and wanted to keep me here." [B2.]</p>
        <p>COLUMBIA TO TAKE OVER BIOSPHERE 2</p>
        <p>Built as a $150-million closed environment where humans could learn to live in space, Biosphere 2 is being taken over for a new purpose: to study global warming and other changes on earth. Columbia University is expected to announce  that it will manage the 3.15-acre dome in the Arizona desert and will turn it into a laboratory and educational center for the earth sciences. The university  is not planning more missions like the unsuccessful attempt by eight men and women to live there two years without access to outside resources, though such experiments have not been entirely ruled out. Instead, the huge greenhouse is being recast as the ultimate test tube for experimenting with future conditions on planet earth. [B2.]</p>
        <p>REGION</p>
        <p>STORMS BATTER AND WINDS RAGE</p>
        <p>Heavy storms flinging wind and rain pummeled much of the New York region, leaving nearly half a million homes without power. A falling tree killed one person, and hundreds of other trees blocked roads and stalled trains. Rain and wind were heaviest in a belt from the Jersey Shore through Manhattan and northeast into Westchester and Connecticut, said Pamela Joyce, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service. The storm dropped 1.93 inches of rain in Central Park, and winds gusted up to 63 miles per hour in Rockland County. [B4.]</p>
        <p>SUNY TRUSTEES TO PRESS INDEPENDENCE</p>
        <p>Governor Pataki does not yet control the governing board of the State University of New York. But his seven appointees have made their agenda clear: bringing a free-market approach to the government-run university system. Beginning in June, Mr. Pataki took advantage of an unusual opportunity to name a large proportion of the SUNY board at once, because his predecessor, Mario M. Cuomo, had not filled some vacancies. With two more openings to be filled, the Governor could have a majority on the 16-member board by December. Already, the  new trustees are shaking up the university. In a set of recent proposals, they advocated giving the campuses more freedom to do everything from setting their own tuitions to keeping any surpluses. [B4.]</p>
