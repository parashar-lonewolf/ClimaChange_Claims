        <p>LEAD: To the Editor:</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Global Lukewarming'' perhaps criticizes the Bush Administration unfairly for not taking the lead in combatting global warming. This effect results primarily from emission of carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels for electricity, heating and vehicle propulsion, creating a blanket that allows the sun's heat to reach the earth, but reflects heat back to earth, rather than allowing it to escape.</p>
        <p>If the energy needed for lighting, cooling, heating, air-conditioning, driving motors, operating computers and propelling vehicles was provided by electricity from nuclear energy, the greenhouse effect wouldn't exist, or could be rolled back. Some energy can be provided from solar and wind power, and much more from hydro power, and conservation can moderate energy demand. But the bottom line is nuclear energy, the only source with enough potential.</p>
        <p>How ironic that the most vociferous critics of the Administration for alleged inaction on global warming are the same people who have opposed nuclear energy and criticize the Administration for supporting it. But the more savvy critics see the handwriting on the wall and are beginning to segue into the pro-nuclear camp, trailing platitudes and provisos, e.g., that plants will have to be made even safer, a high-level waste disposal site must be activated.</p>
        <p>When the mincing becomes a stampede to nuclear, we'll be able to chase away global warming and the environmental pollution from the burning of fossil fuels. R. M. CAMPBELL  Cohasset, Mass., Nov. 8, 1989</p>
