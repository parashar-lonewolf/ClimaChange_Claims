        <p>If Richard G. Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, had his way, President Bush would write off the environment on political grounds, foregoing clean-up programs because they are too costly to industry. And besides, ''nature lovers'' never have made good Republican constituents.</p>
        <p>Mr. Darman's strategy of politicizing the environment ignores the scientific facts and will prove costly to everyone, regardless of political affiliation. Acid rain does not fall only on liberals.</p>
        <p>He would be well advised to join with those in the petroleum industry and ''see the writing on the wall'' - i.e., that ''poll after poll showed that Americans were willing to pay for stronger environmental laws.'' What else can explain the fact that eight Northeastern states will be joining California in enacting strict anti-smog regulations, aimed primarily at the oil and automobile industries? Or the wave of mandated recycling measures sweeping the nation at the state level? The programs entail costs to the consumer, but hardly a word of opposition has been heard from that group. RICHARD F. NEAL  Milford, Conn.</p>
