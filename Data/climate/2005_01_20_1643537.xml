      <abstract>
        <p>Britain's Hadley Center for Climate Prediction and Research scientists conduct study that attributes recent increases in flows of rivers emptying in Arctic Ocean to human-caused global warming; findings, which are result of various environmental simulations, are to be published in Geophysical Research Letters (S)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Human-caused global warming appears to be a ''major driving factor'' behind recent increases in the flows of rivers emptying into the Arctic Ocean, British climate scientists have concluded. The researchers ran computer simulations of the earth's climate and water cycles with and without increasing levels of smokestack and tailpipe emissions linked to rising temperatures. Only simulations that included man-made greenhouse gases generated rising Arctic river flows similar to those actually measured since the 1960's, said the researchers, from the Hadley Center for Climate Prediction and Research. Their findings, described in the next issue of Geophysical Research Letters, are significant because freshening of Arctic waters in millenniums past has sometimes caused abrupt changes in climate around the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
