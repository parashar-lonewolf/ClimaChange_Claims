        <p>President Clinton paid little attention to environmental issues when he first came to office, moved to higher ground as time went on and now has a fairly rosy reputation among conservationists. Profiting from shrewd political advice, he successfully beat back Republican assaults on the country's basic environmental laws and acted decisively to protect Yellowstone National Park, California's redwoods and Utah's wilderness. Although his overriding task in 1998 is to win Senate consent to the treaty on global warming, he and the agencies under his command will have plenty of other chances to build on his earlier record.</p>
        <p>To begin with, he must keep his eye on a Congress that still nourishes an urge to trifle with the statutory protections that have done so much to make this a cleaner and safer country over the past 25 years. Two major laws -- the Superfund program for cleaning up toxic wastes and the law protecting endangered species -- are up for reauthorization, and Mr. Clinton must make sure that the new legislation does not undercut the original intent of either one. He should also press hard to match last year's generous financing for the notoriously undernourished Land and Water Conservation program, and for his ambitious effort to restore Florida's endangered Everglades to good health.</p>

        <p>President Clinton paid little attention to environmental issues when he first came to office, moved to higher ground as time went on and now has a fairly rosy reputation among conservationists. Profiting from shrewd political advice, he successfully beat back Republican assaults on the country's basic environmental laws and acted decisively to protect Yellowstone National Park, California's redwoods and Utah's wilderness. Although his overriding task in 1998 is to win Senate consent to the treaty on global warming, he and the agencies under his command will have plenty of other chances to build on his earlier record.</p>
        <p>To begin with, he must keep his eye on a Congress that still nourishes an urge to trifle with the statutory protections that have done so much to make this a cleaner and safer country over the past 25 years. Two major laws -- the Superfund program for cleaning up toxic wastes and the law protecting endangered species -- are up for reauthorization, and Mr. Clinton must make sure that the new legislation does not undercut the original intent of either one. He should also press hard to match last year's generous financing for the notoriously undernourished Land and Water Conservation program, and for his ambitious effort to restore Florida's endangered Everglades to good health.</p>
        <p>There are also three areas in which he and his subordinates can help chart a new direction.</p>
        <p>Forest Policy. A big battle is coming over the national forests. Senator Larry Craig of Idaho, chairman of the forest subcommittee, is eager to re-write the National Forest Management Act of 1976 in a way that would probably lead to more logging. Meanwhile, the new head of the Agriculture Department's Forest Service, Michael Dombeck, wants to put many roadless areas in the national forests off-limits to new roads and new logging. This would be an extraordinary about-face for an agency that has long been regarded as a willing captive of both the industry it is meant to regulate and the Congressional committees, like Mr. Craig's, that oversee it. Assuming that Mr. Dombeck does not build in too many exceptions -- for example, Alaska's Tongass National Forest -- he deserves Mr. Clinton's strongest support.</p>
        <p>Clean Water. The Clean Water Act of 1972, which last year celebrated its 25th anniversary, has done a good job of improving lakes and streams by controlling pollution from so-called ''point sources'' like factories and municipal waste treatment plants. But it has failed to control poisonous runoff from farms and urban areas. In the last few years, runoff containing hog and chicken wastes has seriously degraded rivers and estuaries in North Carolina and Maryland. A stronger Clean Water Act may be required. Short of that, the Environmental Protection Agency could tighten its regulations and the Agriculture Department could do much more with the Conservation Reserve Program to encourage farmers to convert cropland to wetlands and buffer zones around threatened waterways.</p>
        <p>Utility Deregulation. This does not sound like an environmental issue, but it is. The efforts now underway in many state legislatures to introduce competition to the monopoly-ridden electric power industry may eventually give consumers a wider range of choices and lower their bills. Equally important, by forcing utilities to be more competitive, deregulation will encourage more efficient use of fuels like natural gas. That, in turn, could reduce the greenhouse gases that are believed to be the chief cause of global warming -- Mr. Clinton's top environmental priority in 1998. This is a national issue requiring a Federal focus. Mr. Clinton should get out ahead of it.</p>
