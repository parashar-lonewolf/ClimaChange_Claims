        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Bill McKibben, in his denunciation of political and industry irresponsibility (Op-Ed, May 3), sentences the accused -- man-made carbon dioxide -- before the jury has reached its verdict. He cites recent weather trends as proof of change, and would have us accept that ''cars, factories and burning forests'' cause global warming.</p>
        <p>Short-term events prove nothing. In the Northern Hemisphere, over a thousand centuries, there have been long periods of expanding glaciers, interrupted by shorter periods of warming. We are in a warm period, yet the average temperature for the longer epoch is frigid. We need only look back a dozen millenniums to remember the kilometer-thick glacier that rests on the very spot where we stand.</p>
        <p>Scientists don't know what causes climate shifts; we only understand governing physical principles. Climate depends on interactions so complex as to make forecasts, and hindcasts, no more than reasoned guesses.</p>
        <p>While emissions may affect the climate, constraints on them certainly affect the economy. We must  be careful not to leap over logic: when we elevate human significance in the arena of global influence, we may be making a self-important, and self-deluding, statement of our potency.</p>
        <p>ROBERT S. DISCHEL  New York, May 3, 1997</p>
        <p>The writer is an environmental scientist.</p>
