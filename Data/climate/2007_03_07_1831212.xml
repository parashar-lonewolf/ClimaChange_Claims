        <p>LAWYERS are looking at climate change and seeing visions of new business. They are showing up at meetings to discuss the legal implications of global warming, and a growing number of law firms are advertising expertise in climate change issues. The subject seems well on its way to becoming the next big thing in environmental law.</p>
        <p>''There is definitely a surge of interest among lawyers in this kind of work,'' said Seth Kaplan, a senior attorney in charge of clean energy and climate change issues for the Conservation Law Foundation in Boston. ''A lot of it is brand extension, like lawyers who arranged deals to finance shopping malls now are doing it for wind farms.''</p>
        <p>But there are also more politically charged questions, like those posed before the Supreme Court in November when a group of states and environmental groups argued that the Environmental Protection Agency, despite its protests to the contrary, had the power and obligation through the Clean Air Act to compel the auto industry to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.</p>
        <p>J. Kevin Healy's talks about environmental litigation at professional meetings are another indication of the growing interest. Mr. Healy, a co-chairman of the New York State Bar Association's climate change group, said that about 250 lawyers attended sessions on the subject at the association's meeting last year, and that more than 200 heard him speak at another association meeting last fall.</p>
        <p>''There was one person in the room when I gave my first speech in the early 1990s, and I can't remember if he stayed until the end,'' said Mr. Healy, a partner at Bryan Cave in New York City.</p>
        <p>The biggest growth area for climate lawyers involves new emission-management tools -- like credits for reducing carbon emissions by investing in technologies that reduce power consumption -- and the markets that trade them. The markets are regulated in countries that signed the Kyoto Protocol and, so far, voluntary in the United States, but each has a mind-numbing amount of legal questions to settle.</p>
        <p>''You can accidentally create a lot of work for a lot of lawyers when you design a market for a particular need,'' Mr. Kaplan said. ''You are binding together a lot of resources and obligations, and getting the rules right is very tricky.''</p>
        <p>One basic issue the Supreme Court may tackle in the case involving E.P.A. regulation of the auto industry is whether the states or anyone else has suffered the kind of harm that would allow them to bring such a suit.</p>
        <p>''You have to show the harm is imminent,'' Justice Antonin Scalia told Assistant Attorney General James R. Milkey of Massachusetts. ''I mean, when is the cataclysm?'' Mr. Milkey responded that the harm might not be cataclysmic, but that it was already under way and would continue.</p>
        <p>Mr. Milkey's turn before the Supreme Court spotlighted one of several cases that have drawn litigation specialists to climate issues. Cape Wind, a proposed wind farm in Nantucket Sound in Massachusetts, has been through three rounds of litigation in state and federal courts as it struggles to obtain permits to build its windmills and undersea power lines to bring the electricity ashore. And lawyers for the auto industry and states trying to regulate carbon-dioxide emissions have squared off in procedural battles in federal courts in California, Rhode Island and Vermont.</p>
        <p>In general, though, the climate change practice is populated by lawyers like Madeleine Tan, an international-finance specialist in New York for Brown Rudnick, who helped both the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the European Investment Bank create a fund to buy carbon credits in 29 Central European and Asian nations.</p>
        <p>The fund, whose investors include six nations stretching from Finland to Spain as well as six companies, will buy credits generated from projects in less-developed countries, like planting new forests, switching from coal-fired plants to natural gas or to renewable energy, and capturing methane currently vented into the air. By aggregating investors and the projects, the banks aimed to reduce the risks involved in creating emissions-reductions projects in less-developed regions with widely varying bankruptcy and property laws.</p>
        <p>Ms. Tan helped draft the rules governing the fund's operations and the employment contracts of the consultants who are sent to locate suitable projects, among other things.</p>
        <p>Climate change looks complex enough to suit Ms. Tan's experience with ''funky structures'' for years to come, she said. ''This area has a lot of legs.''</p>
        <p>Some consultants who track trends in the profession say that the interest in climate change is probably broader than it is deep at most law firms. Even those who have set up dedicated practice groups on paper might have only one or two partners working full time on such projects.</p>
        <p>''Lawyers are not used to investing, either in finding people who know what they are doing and bringing them on or, in a field like this where we are making it up as we go along, giving people the time to go to conferences,'' said Joel Henning, a Chicago-based consultant for Hildebrandt International, the largest legal-consulting company. Mr. Henning said he expected the new Democratic-led Congress to usher in plenty of work for lawyers who specialize in lobbying governments on behalf of clients, as new laws and regulations develop.</p>
        <p>The interest seems long overdue to lawyers like Mr. Healy, who traces his awareness to 1983, when he represented New York City in negotiations among New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania on how to allocate water from the Delaware River.</p>
        <p>Mr. Healy said that Gerald M. Hansler, the executive director of the Delaware River Basin Commission, advised that global warming and the effect of rising sea levels on the river's lower reaches should be taken into account. After that, Mr. Healy said, he began studying -- and eventually advising clients and other lawyers -- about the work of scientists like James E. Hansen, a NASA climatologist who has been an outspoken federal official on the subject.</p>
        <p>Mr. Healy agreed with the common view that multinational law firms like Baker &amp; McKenzie, which formed its climate practice as far back as 1999, and those with a large presence in Europe have an advantage because they are becoming experienced with carbon-trading systems.</p>
        <p>But that will not necessarily last, Mr. Healy said. ''Lawyers learn fast,'' he said, ''and there is plenty of work to go around.''</p>
