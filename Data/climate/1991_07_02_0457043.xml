        <p>European and Indonesian scientists examined the reef, which is just off the coast of Sumba Island. The reef formed in a series of terraces, resembling a staircase, with each step representing the growth of the reef between ice ages. By measuring the decay of uranium in samples taken from the reef, the scientists approximated its geological history.</p>
        <p>Dr. Ulrich Radtke, a professor of geography at Heinrich-Heine University in Dusseldorf, Germany, said that by understanding how changes in climate affected sea level over the last million years, scientists can better understand how global warming might affect the climate today. The findings were published in the current issue of the journal Nature.</p>
        <p>Scientists have been exploring such reefs since the 1960's at sites off the coast of Barbados and Papau, New Guinea. Geological records of glacial cycles have been largely destroyed on land by the action of glaciers. Therefore many scientists have turned to the marine record to analyze changes in climate.</p>
