        <p>Two months after NASA's top climate scientist complained that political operatives in the agency's press office were trying to censor his views on global warming, Administrator Michael D.

        <p>Two months after NASA's top climate scientist complained that political operatives in the agency's press office were trying to censor his views on global warming, Administrator Michael D. Griffin issued a new communications policy on Thursday that he called a ''commitment to openness.''</p>
        <p>The policy, which details the role of those who release information to the public directly or through the news media, ensures that NASA scientists and engineers are free to discuss their work in public and state their opinions, Dr. Griffin said. When stating a personal opinion, he continued, they should make clear that they are speaking for themselves and not for the agency.</p>
        <p>In a presentation to employees, and later during a telephone news conference, Dr. Griffin and Shana Dale, the deputy administrator, said the policy replaced a code, last updated in 1991, that was ''not clear enough or articulate enough.''</p>
        <p>The agency came under fire when James E. Hansen, director of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies, a NASA office, told The New York Times in late January that the Bush administration had tried to stop him from speaking out after he gave a lecture in December calling for prompt reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases linked to global warming.</p>
        <p>Dr. Hansen and several other employees of the agency said administration appointees in the public affairs office had demanded to review his lectures and publications in advance. In addition, he said, senior agency officials sought the right to stand in for him in interviews with reporters.</p>
        <p>Other scientists also expressed concern when political appointees altered news releases and Internet presentations against their wishes.</p>
        <p>After a barrage of complaints from lawmakers and scientific organizations, Dr. Griffin appointed a 12-member group of senior NASA scientists and public affairs officials to draft a new public communications policy.</p>
        <p>In an interview on Thursday, Dr. Hansen said that the revised policy was ''definitely better'' than before and that his latest dealings with NASA public affairs had been much improved.</p>
        <p>''I'm very optimistic,'' he said. ''Things have changed dramatically since this became a public issue. This has been a healthy exercise, and hopefully similar things will happen at other agencies that have had similar problems.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Griffin said political appointees would continue to work at NASA, as is customary under any administration, but would not unduly influence the new openness policy. Dean Acosta, a spokesman, said there were five political appointees among the agency's 300-member public affairs staff, and about 18 in all positions throughout NASA.</p>
        <p>In the news conference, Dr. Griffin also addressed recent criticism suggesting that at a Rotary Club gala in Texas last week, he endorsed Representative Tom DeLay for re-election. Mr. DeLay, who gave up his post as House majority leader in September after being indicted in a campaign finance case, represents a district that includes the Johnson Space Center in Houston.</p>
        <p>The NASA chief has said that although he is entitled to issue political endorsements under certain circumstances, he will not. On Thursday he said he had not endorsed Mr. DeLay at the gathering but rather, in response to a gracious introduction from the congressman, had praised his support for the space program. While confirming his words, quoted in The Houston Chronicle, Dr. Griffin added that they were not as precise as they should have been and had been ''grossly misinterpreted.''</p>
        <p>''The space program,'' Dr. Griffin said at the gala, ''has had no better friend in its entire existence than Tom DeLay. He's still with us, and we need to keep him there.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Griffin said Thursday that he had meant keeping Mr. DeLay's support for the space program.</p>
        <p>''I regret the inartful choice of words,'' he said. ''I'm not endorsing anybody. I don't intend to.''</p>
