        <p>About six million barrels of oil, weighing roughly a million tons, around 10 percent of the world's daily oil ration, are going up in smoke</p>
        <p>every day</p>
        <p>from the 550 Kuwaiti wells set afire by Iraqi occupiers.</p>
        <p>None of the fires have yet been put out, and at the projected extinction rate of five days per well, the job could take as long as two years. Meanwhile, the burning wells emit a daily load of 50,000 tons of sulfur dioxide -- a prime cause of acid rain -- and 100,000 tons of sooty smoke into the atmosphere. The remainder is mostly carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>Scientific experts disagree on how bad the environmental consequences might be. But U.S. authorities seem to have been worried about causing a real disaster. Just as they controlled information about the desert war itself, they also clamped down on discussion by Department of Energy officials</p>
        <p>in this country</p>
        <p>about "environmental impacts of fires/oil spills in the Middle East." This is reported, along with details of the conflagration and its results, by John Horgan in the May issue of Scientific American.</p>
        <p>The order limiting information to "the media" -- a copy of which was obtained by Mr. Horgan -- was issued in writing on Jan. 25, just after the war began, by the D.O.E. office in San Francisco. A department spokesman told me that the purpose was to deny "information useful to the Iraqis." But it was the Iraqis who set the fires; and the same office told Mr. Horgan the order was not rescinded until March 22, well after hostilities ended, by telephone.</p>
        <p>Was it feared in Washington that dire environmental forecasts about oil-well fires might dim enthusiasm for the war? That seems possible, since Saddam Hussein threatened as early as September to destroy Kuwait's wells if the allies tried to drive him out; by January, few could have doubted that he would do it.</p>
        <p>There's no doubt that Kuwait itself has suffered what Raymond Henry, an American firefighting expert, called an environmental "catastrophe." Daytime temperatures beneath the thick smoke clouds are far below normal, hospitals are jammed with respiratory patients, "black rain" is damaging crops and water supplies, and the fierce fires rage on.</p>
        <p>Farther away, estimates vary.  Some authorities predict a global warming effect owing to an increase of as much as 5 percent in emissions of carbon dioxide. Others foresee a sort of "nuclear winter" caused by the 30-odd million tons of smoke the burning wells are expected to emit in a year; if only 1 percent of the smoke reaches the stratosphere, Richard Crutzen of the Max Planck Institute has calculated, by the end of the year the northern hemisphere would be cooled by two degrees Celsius.</p>
        <p>Other experts dispute such predictions; but even one of them, Richard Small of the Pacific-Sierra Research Corporation, told Mr. Horgan that "we have never seen a pollution event of this scale." Damage, he said, might be felt over an area extending 1,000 kilometers from Kuwait.</p>
        <p>Saddam Hussein's forces, of course, actually set the fires and caused this immense environmental threat. He had plainly warned that he would do it, however; so the U.S., by its decision to launch the war anyway rather than rely on non-combat pressures, bears some responsibility.</p>
        <p>The Administration insists it had no real alternative to war. But if environmental damage from Kuwaiti fires proves as bad as pessimists predict, the resulting damage and casualties may again appear out of proportion to Iraq's offense. Already a U.N. report concludes that Iraq has been bombed back to the "pre-industrial age," its infrastructure destroyed, its people beset by famine and disease. Was that degree of destruction unavoidable or warranted?</p>
        <p>To free Kuwait's 750,000 nationals, for another example, the allies are estimated to have killed more than 100,000 of the 18 million Iraqis. John Allen Paulos of Temple University, the author of "Innumeracy," compared that casualty rate with the population of the U.S. and found that, had the tables been turned, more than 1.4 million Americans would have died in the same period.</p>
        <p>As for environmental damage, Joel S. Levine of NASA, an authority on biomass burning, told Mr. Horgan the Kuwaiti well fires were "the most intense burning source, probably, in the history of the world."  IN THE NATION</p>
