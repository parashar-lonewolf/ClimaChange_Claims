        <p>AS time grows short in the latest and most serious attempt to deal with the prospect of global warming, everyone is waiting for two decisive players -- the United States and Japan -- to get their acts together.</p>
        <p>Last week in Bonn, negotiators representing 145 countries inched closer to what would be the first international agreement on legally binding reductions in emissions of waste industrial gases, like carbon dioxide, that trap heat in the atmosphere.  Mainstream scientists say these greenhouse gases threaten to disrupt the earth's climate and may already be doing so.</p>
        <p>But with only one more session scheduled in the two-year-old talks before a final meeting in Kyoto, Japan, in December, both the United States and Japan have yet to produce their proposals for specific reductions and timetables. Until they do, negotiators here said, no breakthrough is possible.</p>
        <p>Japanese and American proposals are ''the key to the success of the process,'' Raul Estrada-Oyuela of Argentina, the chairman of the United Nations-sponsored talks, told the delegates.</p>
        <p>Japan is seen as a pivotal nation because of its economic strength and because, as host of the final session, it will be in a special position to influence the outcome of the talks. The United States, by virtue of its economic weight, international influence and huge emissions of greenhouse gases, is the 900-pound gorilla of international climate politics.</p>
        <p>''Without the U.S., nothing will happen -- it is absolutely crucial,'' said Bert Metz, a veteran climate negotiator from the Netherlands.</p>
        <p>It may be that nothing will happen anyway. The complexities, economic stakes and rival interests at play in the talks are such that few would express surprise if they failed to produce a meaningful agreement.  But leaders of major countries have become personally engaged in the issue, infusing it with new bite and raising it to a new level of relevance and visibility.</p>
        <p>President Clinton says that he finds the scientific evidence for the fact of climate change ''pretty compelling.'' He supports legally binding but ''realistic'' emissions reductions.  He has opened a campaign to rally popular support for what could be unpopular steps to reduce the burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil, the main source of carbon dioxide emissions.</p>
        <p>But the United States has yet to propose any amounts by which emissions should be reduced or to say when limits should take effect. Until it puts numbers on the table, the nature and strength of the American commitment are impossible to judge.</p>
        <p>American negotiators in Bonn told a number of major countries privately that Mr. Clinton was strongly committed to binding action and that his Government was working intensively to complete the specifics of its proposal, a senior Administration official said. The American delegates also told their counterparts that any agreement acceptable to the United States must maintain economic growth, the official said.</p>
        <p>The Administration is widely expected to announce its proposal after a scheduled White House conference on climate in early October and before or during the next negotiation session here, from Oct. 20 to Oct. 31.</p>
        <p>Toshiaki Tanabe, the chief Japanese delegate in Bonn, acknowledged the concern about his country and the United States. Like the Americans, he said in an interview, Japan is ''still in the process of working out our figures.'' He did not say when they would be ready.</p>
        <p>While the talks go on, lobbying and debate intensify. On one extreme are representatives of industries that produce fossil fuels, who argue that cutting emissions will hurt economies. It is better, they say, to study  global warming more to be sure that the remedy matches the threat rather than rush to judgment. On the other end of the spectrum are environmentalists who say that every year that passes without action will make climatic disruption more likely, more serious and more painful to deal with in the end. Unless a first step is taken now, they say, it might be years before the opportunity comes again, and by then climatic disruption might be obvious to all.</p>
        <p>The most influential reduction proposal on the table so far is that of the European Union, which calls for industrialized countries to cut their emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide (all greenhouse gases) by 15 percent by 2010 and by 7.5 percent by 2005.</p>
        <p>No reduction targets and timetables for developing countries are being formally discussed in Bonn.  Those countries have a general obligation, under a 1992 climate treaty signed in Rio de Janeiro, to reduce their emissions. But a conference of parties to the treaty that met in Berlin in 1995 expressly exempted the poorer countries from any new, more specific commitments in the present talks. The poorer nations have long insisted that since the industrialized countries got rich by burning fossil fuels, developing countries should not be unfairly penalized as they build their own industries.</p>
        <p>The issue of the developing countries' role may be the thorniest in the talks, and many insiders believe that it has the most potential to scuttle them. Both the Clinton Administration and the United States Senate, which must ratify any Kyoto deal, are insisting that all countries must play some role in reducing emissions. Otherwise, it is feared, some American industries might move their operations to developing countries if those countries had no similar emissions controls.</p>
        <p>The 1992 treaty, ratified by the Senate, included an important compromise on principle: Since the rich countries have emitted the most greenhouse gases so far, they should take the lead in controlling emissions. But the developing countries' emissions are expected to equal or surpass those of the richer nations after 2010 or so, and it was always expected that the developing countries would follow the lead of the developed nations -- once it was clear that they were indeed moving.</p>
        <p>That evidence has not yet appeared. First, the rich countries have generally failed to cap their emissions at 1990 levels voluntarily, as the treaty says they must aim to do.  Only two large countries, Germany and Britain, are succeeding at that.  And there is that lack of concrete new proposals from the United States and Japan.</p>
        <p>There are a number of ways the developing countries might participate. Their targets and timetables need not be the same as that of the rich countries, for example, and their adoption could be contingent on the rich countries' adoption of their own targets and schedules. Or a rich country could get credit for some emissions reductions by providing money or technology to help a developing country reduce its emissions.  That would cut the cost of the reductions, and since the gases, once emitted, quickly become part of a single, global concentration, it does not matter where the reductions come from.</p>
        <p>The United States favors this ''joint implementation'' approach but, over all, developing countries are skeptical. Still, the idea is already being tested in pilot projects, although no emissions-reduction credit is yet being awarded to rich countries for undertaking them.</p>
        <p>At the meeting here, representatives of developing countries, citing recent studies, said they were already doing more than expected to control emissions. As for binding new commitments for the poorer nations, ''one should not take on something he is not able to deliver,'' said Mark J. Mwandosya of Tanzania, the chairman of the developing-country caucus in the talks. But he did not rule anything in or out, saying he ''wouldn't like to prejudge Kyoto,'' where the developing-country issue is expected to be decided -- or not.</p>
        <p>As for the industrialized countries, Mr. Estrada said he hoped to have an agreement on their reduction commitments nailed down by the end of the next Bonn session in October (it will be the eighth negotiating session since 1995).</p>
        <p>Achieving that agreement is not merely a matter of setting reduction targets and timetables. Both the Americans and the Japanese, for instance, believe that the structure within which the reductions would take place is just as important. They want countries to have the flexibility  to achieve reductions in ways that make the best sense for themselves, and at the least cost.</p>
        <p>The United States, for instance, has proposed that reductions be carried out over a series of multiyear  periods, with the reduction targets  expressed as an annual average of emissions for each period as a whole.  It also advocates the ''banking'' of emissions reductions: applying reductions achieved in one period  against the next, and ''borrowing'' from a future period -- at a penalty -- to meet the current period's targets.</p>
        <p>The United States further proposes an arrangement called ''emissions trading.'' In this approach, countries that find it difficult and expensive to reduce their emissions could purchase a permit to emit more than they are allowed from countries that find it less costly and easier. The price of the permits would be determined by supply and demand in an open market. The rationale is that in the long run, and over all, emissions reductions would be both cheaper and more effective.</p>
        <p>In another idea on the table, some countries favor tailoring emissions reductions and the means of achieving them to a country's individual economic and energy profile, rather than imposing a flat-rate, one-size-fits-all target and a fixed set of methods. There would presumably be an overall reduction target, and countries would negotiate how much of it they would be responsible for. The European Union has devised an internal arrangement similar to this for its members, with countries like Britain and Germany taking on bigger reduction burdens than others.</p>
        <p>But for now, the world is looking to the United States and Japan to take their stands. ''When we have those two proposals,'' Mr. Estrada said,  ''the other pieces will fall into place.''</p>

        <p>Between now and December, when representatives of most nations will meet in Japan to discuss limits on greenhouse gases, The Times will examine the science, politics and economics of climate change.</p>
