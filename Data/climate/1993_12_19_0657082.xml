        <p>IT WAS AT A PRIVATE LUNCHeon in New York on Oct. 8, 1991, that Philippe de Montebello, director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, first asked a senior official from Spain's Culture Ministry to support a major exhibition on the art of medieval Spain. Delighted by the Spaniard's enthusiastic response, Mr. de Montebello gave his team the go-ahead for what promised to be one of the museum's showpiece exhibitions of the 1990's.</p>
        <p>The Met and Spain already had an impeccable record of working together, starting in 1987, on major exhibitions of such figures as Zurbaran, Goya, Velazquez and Ribera, as well as of the Islamic art of Spain. In the two years that followed the meeting with Jose Maria Luzon Nogue, then Spain's Director General of Fine Arts, Met officials combed Spain for the 80 or so works -- from Visigothic marble tombs to Romanesque wooden carvings -- they would need from that country. In all, the show was to include some 160 works.</p>
        <p>"It was to be the most ambitious Spanish exhibition to date," said Mahrukh Tarapor, the Met's associate director for exhibitions, who played a crucial role in organizing earlier Spanish shows. "It was to be the Met's tribute to Spain, examining the most critical and formative period of Spanish history."</p>
        <p>Then, barely two weeks before the official opening on Nov. 15, "The Art of Medieval Spain, A.D. 500-1200" was abruptly called off. Many in the art world were stunned. Exhibitions are sometimes delayed, even canceled, but the Met had never before postponed a major show this late in the day -- with catalogues already in print and invitations in the mail.</p>
        <p>The museum felt it had no choice. At that moment, the pieces that had been chosen and approved for loan to the Met were still scattered around Spain. Since it was unclear when they would arrive in New York, Mr. de Montebello said in a press release on Oct. 29 that the museum's own calender of events "precluded our accommodating even a brief delay in 'Medieval Spain.' " But he said he hoped the show could still be held "sometime in 1995."</p>
        <p>So what happened? Why did time run out? The story tells much about the complexity of mounting ambitious international loan exhibitions and how and why minor details can derail them -- although rarely so dramatically as in this case. Yet while there is some finger-pointing</p>
        <p>between Spain and the Met, there seems to be no single explanation for why these longtime associates failed to come together on so important an occasion.</p>
        <p>Clearly, this was a complicated exhibition to organize, with about half the pieces coming from Spain and the rest from elsewhere in Europe and the United States. In Spain, it involved borrowing from independent institutions all over the country. Spanish elections in late June brought Cabinet changes that delayed the approval of loans. And poor communications between Spain and the Met seem to have plagued the negotiations.</p>
        <p>The final bottleneck was bureaucratic. Before approving the temporary export of the works, the Culture Ministry's rules required a mountain of documents. The Met says it was unaware of this requirement until late September. And by the time the documents were rounded up in a last-minute scramble in which ministry officials lent a hand, the art should already have been in New York and ready for installation.</p>
        <p>Yet if any culprit can be identified, it is perhaps the cultural gap that still separates Americans and Spaniards. For the Met, the show could only heighten Spain's image in the United States -- and it took Spanish cooperation for granted. But in Spain, politics, religious sentiments and regional pride all emerged as complicating factors when it came to deciding what should be lent.  An Ominous Sign Provincials Say Madrid Has Doubts</p>
        <p>The problems surrounding this show had not arisen in the Met's previous dealings with Spain because the shows of Spanish masters like Goya had involved borrowing paintings from the Prado and a few other Government-run museums. In the case of last year's Islamic art show, the Spanish Government was a participant and a Spanish bank the main sponsor. But with "The Art of Medieval Spain," the Met was the sole organizer. Even more important, the priceless objects it wished to display were the property of dozens of churches, cathedrals, Catholic schools and regional museums, each with a right of veto.</p>
        <p>Aware of this, Ms. Tarapor, along with Charles T. Little, curator of the exhibition, and other experts made numerous trips to Spain, going from institution to institution, inspecting objects and persuading their owners that nothing untoward would happen to them. Most owners agreed to lend their pieces, which ranged from wooden and stone statues, parts of altars and ancient Bibles to paintings, textiles, and marble and ivory sculptures. But Ms. Tarapor said some owners told her that the central Government in Spain was not enthusiastic about the exhibition. In Spain, that was an ominous sign.</p>
        <p>The view from Madrid, on the other hand, was that public opposition to lending certain pieces of great religious significance was growing in some regions. In a June 28 letter to Mr. de Montebello, Mr. Luzon reminded him that each loan had to be approved by the owner, technical experts and the Culture Ministry's 22-member Junta of Qualification, Evaluation and Exportation. He also warned of "growing sensitivity expressed in different media in the sense that some works of art should not be moved from the places where they are habitually kept."</p>
        <p>By then, the loan of 12 medieval objects had already been denied -- 6 by the cultural authorities of Catalonia, who argued that the "exceptional" paintings on wood could be damaged by "possible vibrations and climate change," 3 by the Museum of the Cathedral of Gerona and 3 by the Archeological Museum of Oviedo. Gerona and Oviedo gave no reason for their refusals.</p>
        <p>The Met was even more disappointed when the Culture Ministry refused to approve the loan of two other pieces the museum had avidly sought. In the case of the 12th-century marble Sarcophagus of Dona Sancha, the ministry appeared to respond to local opposition, although its owner, the Benedictine Monastery of Santa Cruz at Jaca in the Pyrenees, had approved the loan. In the case of the Reliquary of San Isidoro from Leon, an 11th-century silver gilt box, the loan of which had been approved by the Bishop of Leon, the ministry's evaluation committee judged it too fragile to travel. The Final Blow One Requirement Too Many</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, plans for the exhibition were moving ahead. On July 30, Herbert Moskowitz, the registrar of the Met, informed Jesus Macarron that his Madrid shipping company had been chosen to pack and transport the pieces to New York and promised to send "an updated list of loans" within two weeks. It finally arrived on Sept. 3. On Sept. 23, Mr. Macarron presented the evaluation committee with a final list of 82 pieces for temporary export, confident that approval would be a formality.</p>
        <p>The Met, too, was beginning to relax. In mid-September, Ms. Tarapor met the new Culture Minister, Carmen Alborch Bataller, who agreed to write a brief introduction to the 358-page catalogue, which by then was ready to go to the printers.</p>
        <p>"From the start, we planned the catalogue as a definitive book on Spanish medieval art," she said, "so we included many works that we knew we might not get. But we also avoided listing lenders to the exhibition because we didn't know what we'd have. In fact, Philippe de Montebello only wrote his foreword after we received Mrs. Alborch's text at the end of September. At that point, we were confident that our deadline would be met." (The catalogue, published by Abrams, is now for sale at the museum.)</p>
        <p>But it was around this time that things began to go badly wrong. When the evaluation committee met on Sept. 24, it approved the loan of 38 pieces belonging to the central Government but said it could not act on the remaining objects without letters from their 19 different owners confirming the loans, plus technical reports from experts certifying that the pieces could travel. Both Mr. Macarron and Culture Ministry officials then began contacting owners, but Ms. Tarapor said she only learned of the delay on Oct. 14. By then time was running out.</p>
        <p>The committee met again on Oct. 22 and approved all but seven pieces sought by the Met. Three days earlier, Mr. Luzon had been replaced as Director General of Fine Arts by Jose Guirao, an Andalusian art expert. With Mr. de Montebello in contact with the Culture Minister, Ms. Tarapor urged Mr. Guirao to reconsider some of the denials. The ministry stood firm in refusing the Sarcophagus of Dona Sancha and the Reliquary of San Isidoro, but five more pieces were approved, including the Urraca Chalice from Leon that decorates the back of the catalogue. On Oct. 28, Mr. de Montebello and Mr. Guirao agreed on a final list of 80 objects.</p>
        <p>At that point, the pieces were still languishing all over Spain. Mr. Macarron had hoped to start packing on Oct. 25 but wasn't given the green light by the Met until Oct. 28. The next day he was told that every crate had to be brought to Madrid, unpacked, inspected by a curator from the National Archeological Museum and repacked before being shipped. On top of that, he said, the assigned curator was taking an extended weekend break and would not be available until Nov. 3.</p>
        <p>"With that additional requirement, which no one had known anything about, he told us he could not make the deadline," Ms. Tarapor said. That same day, Oct. 29, Mr. de Montebello called off the exhibition. The Explanations Nobody Nudging Things Along</p>
        <p>In his statement, Mr. de Montebello cited the Spanish elections: "A lengthy period of governmental transition occurred during which the crucial approval process for loans came to a virtual halt. The time lost simply could not be recouped." He thanked officials at the Culture Ministry for their "heroic efforts" but said it was "inappropriate" to rush the shipment to New York. "Our primary concern and responsibility is the safety of works of art."</p>
        <p>It is true that Mrs. Alborch had taken over only at the end of July -- and that Spain traditionally closes down during the vacation month of August. But others, like Mr. Luzon, say the real problem was the Met's failure to present papers to the evaluations committee.</p>
        <p>"It is unjust to blame the change of government or bureaucracy," he said. "They should have had someone in Spain handling all the paperwork for a very complex exhibition like this. That's what happened with the Islamic art exhibition. You can't replace permits from the owners with high-level representations in the ministry."</p>
        <p>Mr. Luzon, who has returned to teaching archeology at a Madrid university, insisted that he had intervened personally to obtain the approval of some owners and had even appointed an official to handle the paperwork. Clearly bitter over suggestions that his office had not fully backed the exhibition, he said: "The Met may have had other difficulties, but it is not fair that they should seek a scapegoat. They've had to postpone an exhibition, and they're trying to save face."</p>
        <p>His replacement, Mr. Guirao, agreed that the Met should have appointed a representative in Spain to nudge things along. "Administration in Spain is very complicated," he said, "and everything takes time. In this case, the pieces needed the approval of the owners, the regional governments and the junta. If the borrower only presents a list, the ministry has to do the querying."</p>
        <p>For Ms. Tarapor, however, the paperwork demanded by the Culture Ministry came as a complete surprise. "Since 1987, we have never been asked to provide anything beyond a list with the insurance evaluation of the lenders," she said. "If the rules changed somewhere along the way, the ministry had a responsibility to inform us." Mr. Macarron said he too was puzzled by the requirement. "I've never before had to give loan forms to the junta," he said. And in Mr. de Montebello's view, this time the Met faced "an extremely conservative junta, many of whose members were not well disposed to loans."</p>
        <p>Before postponing the exhibition, Mr. de Montebello met with a dozen aides to discuss whether the opening could be delayed. But it could not, Ms. Tarapor said, because the museum's calendar was packed for November and December, including openings of "The Gold of Meroe" on Nov. 23, the Florence Gould galleries on Dec. 1, "Diana Vreeland: Immoderate Style" on Dec. 9 and a Lucian Freud retrospective on Dec. 16. And the galleries where the Spanish medieval show was to be held were needed in early May for an exhibition of American Impressionism. The Future Morale Is Down, But Wait Till 1995</p>
        <p>The postponement was clearly a blow to morale at the Met. "We're all feeling so badly burned," Ms. Tarapor said. "We have a shellshocked institution but one that has acted with honesty throughout." The museum had not yet calculated the cost of the postponement, she said, but she estimated the show's original budget at around $1 million. Still, at least there was no need to cancel expensive catering arrangements because, with no outside sponsor to pay for a gala dinner, the Met had planned a low-key opening. Further, since installation had not begun in the now empty galleries, only Mr. Macarron's company has still to be paid.</p>
        <p>Was the Met a victim, Mr. de Montebello was asked. "We are, no question, but so is Spain and Spanish art, which is not being represented in the premier museum of the Western Hemisphere," he replied. In Spain, in contrast, the postponement of the exhibition came as a surprise. "Perhaps it was not well organized from the first moment," a Culture Ministry spokeswoman said, adding "The ministry acted impeccably."</p>
        <p>Despite all the misunderstandings surrounding this affair, both the Met and Spain's Culture Ministry seem eager to resume good relations. Noting that the two sides have a long record of close collaboration, Mr. Guirao said Spain is "always interested in participating in any exhibition at an institution like the Met." And in a letter to Mrs. Alborch thanking her for her help, Mr. de Montebello said that 1995, when the Met celebrates its 125th anniversary, would be a "propitious occasion" to hold the medieval art exhibition "on a scale that the subject and the works deserve."</p>
        <p>Ms. Tarapor was also ready to look forward. "It will be the most glorious show of Spanish art ever," she said. "And, if Spain wants it to be, it will be."</p>
