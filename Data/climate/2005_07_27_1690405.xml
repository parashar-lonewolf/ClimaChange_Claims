        <p>Judge Says No to New Doors</p>
        <p>Two members of the Doors have been barred by a Los Angeles Superior Court judge from using the band's name or any likeness of its front man, Jim Morrison, who died in 1971, to promote a new version of the band, The Associated Press reported. In his decision to grant an injunction, Judge Gregory W. Alarcon sided with the Doors' drummer John Densmore, who brought a breach-of-contract suit in February 2003 against the keyboardist Ray Manzarek and the guitarist Robby Krieger, right. They have been touring without Mr. Densmore under the name the Doors of the 21st Century. Mr. Densmore's lawyer, S. Jerome Mandel, said the members of the band had a ''unanimity requirement'' that gave any of them a veto over matters involving the Doors. The judge also ordered Mr. Manzarek and Mr. Krieger to turn over profits, estimated by Mr. Mandel at $3 million to $4 million, to a Doors partnership that includes them, Mr. Densmore and the estates of Morrison and his girlfriend, Pamela Courson, who died in 1974.</p>
        <p>Boos at Bayreuth</p>
        <p>Boos, jeers and whistles greeted the 94th Bayreuth Festival's new production of Wagner's ''Tristan und Isolde,'' Agence France-Presse reported yesterday. Described as a cold and clinically intellectual interpretation, the performance, which opened the festival in Germany on Monday, starred Robert Dean Smith and Nina Stemme, at left, as Tristan and Isolde. It was staged by the Swiss director Christoph Marthaler in his Bayreuth debut and conducted by Eiji Oue, the first Asian to conduct in the Festspielhaus, the Bayreuth Festival Theater. At the end, Mr. Oue kissed the floorboards in a gesture of reverence to Wagner, who conceived the event. To be performed through Aug. 28, all 30 performances of five Wagner operas, including ''Lohengrin,'' ''The Flying Dutchman,'' ''Tannhauser'' and ''Parsifal,'' are sold out.</p>
        <p>Mel Gibson's Mayan Movie</p>
        <p>Mel Gibson, below, who gave audiences dialogue in Aramaic, Latin and Hebrew when he made ''The Passion of the Christ,'' will turn to another ancient tongue -- a Mayan dialect -- for his next production, Reuters reported. Under a deal with the Walt Disney Company, he is to start the cameras turning on the film, ''Apocalypto,'' in Mexico in October and plans a release next summer, said Alan Nierob, a spokesman. He said that Mr. Gibson, who will also direct, wrote the script for the adventure story set long in the past but will not play a role. A note on the first page of the script says, ''The dialogue you are about to read will not be spoken in English.'' Presumably the script will be translated into Mayan, and the film, like ''The Passion of the Christ,'' will have English subtitles.  Jodie Foster is resuming her career as a director for the first time since 1995 (''Home for the Holidays''), Reuters reported. Her new project is ''Sugar Kings,'' a drama for Universal Pictures in which she may star. Based on ''In the Kingdom of Big Sugar,'' a Vanity Fair article by Marie Brenner, the story tells of a woman, fresh out of law school, who teams with an experienced public interest lawyer to represent exploited migrant workers against a powerful sugar baron.  ''Munich'' is the title of the new Steven Spielberg film about the aftermath of the killing of 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, Germany, The Associated Press reported. The thriller, financed by DreamWorks and Universal, stars Eric Bana (''The Hulk,'' ''Troy'') as a Mossad agent who leads an Israeli squad assigned to assassinate 11 Palestinians suspected of plotting the slaughter. ''Munich'' is to be released on Dec. 23.  Dates for the Oscar season of nominations, balloting and gleaming statuettes were announced yesterday by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Nominations for the 78th annual Academy Awards are to be announced on Jan. 31 at 5:30 a.m. Pacific time. Ballots will be mailed to the 5,800 members on Feb. 8, and the polls will close on Feb. 28. The awards ceremony, to be televised by ABC, is to take place at the Kodak Theater in Hollywood on March 5.</p>
        <p>King Tut Shows His Power</p>
        <p>With tickets priced as high as $30, the King Tut exhibition that opened in mid-June at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art drew 500,000 visitors in its first month, Agence France-Presse reported. The show, ''Tutankhamen and the Golden Age of the Pharaohs,'' continuing through Nov. 15, is on the first leg of 27-month United States tour that will take it to Chicago, Fort Lauderdale and Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>Someone Grasped the Idea</p>
        <p>An American artist appealed yesterday for the return of his work, which vanished from a festival in Devon in southwest England, Agence France-Presse reported. ''It was very, very clear what it was: a work of art,'' said its creator, Wayne Hill. The work in question, titled ''Weapon of Mass Destruction,'' consisted of a clear plastic two-liter bottle filled with melted ice from the Antarctic. It was, he said, intended to draw attention to the dangers of global warming. ''It looked like an ordinary bottle of water, but it was on a plinth, labeled, described and in the program of the whole festival,'' he said. ''Nobody has any idea what has happened to it. It was there, and then it was gone.''</p>
        <p>Bruce Lee Remembered</p>
        <p>A six-foot-tall bronze statue depicting the kung-fu film star Bruce Lee, below, is to be unveiled in Hong Kong in November to commemorate his 65th birthday, the BBC reported. The statue of Lee, who died at 32 in 1973, will be financed by the Hong Kong Bruce Lee fan club. His fans have been invited to choose among three poses in an Internet poll.</p>

        <p>A two-disc DVD of ''Star Wars: Episode III -- Revenge of the Sith'' is to be released by Fox Home Entertainment and Lucasfilm Ltd. on Nov. 1, when LucasArts will release the video game ''Star Wars Battlefront II,'' the sequel to ''Star Wars Battlefront.''  Autographs, posters and a chance to pose with a star are among the attractions of the 19th annual Broadway Flea Market &amp; Grand Auction, , a benefit for Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS, to be held on Sept. 25 from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. in Shubert Alley at West 44th Street.</p>
