        <p>Embracing a strikingly broad concept of national security, President Clinton told the graduating class of the United States Coast Guard Academy today that the world is becoming more dangerous with new threats from disease, terrorism and even global warming.</p>
        <p>''The central reality of our time is that the advent of globalization and the revolution in information technology have magnified both the creative and destructive potential of every individual, tribe and nation on our planet,'' he told the audience of 5,000, which included 189 graduating cadets, a third of them women.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton also sought to link his message about America's long-term security with the imminent political question of extending trade preferences to China, saying Congress should realize that the vote on the issue next week will have deep implications for America's security.</p>
        <p>''One of the biggest question marks of the 21st century is the path China will take,'' he said. ''Will China emerge as a partner or an adversary? Will it be a society that is opening to the world and liberating to its people or controlling of its people and lashing out at the world?''</p>
        <p>If Congress votes to provide China with permanent normal trade relations, Mr. Clinton said, ''it will not guarantee that China will take the right course.'' But, he added, ''I believe a 'no' vote invites a future of dangerous confrontation and constant insecurity.''</p>
        <p>The kind of global cooperation required in the future, the president said, was in evidence when the authorities foiled a plan by Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile living in Afghanistan, to smuggle explosive materials into the United States before the New Year. Links between Mr. bin Laden's associates and terrorist plots uncovered in Jordan and at the United States-Canadian border have been widely reported, but the president's comments today were his most extensive on the subject.</p>
        <p>Presidents have used commencement speeches before the service academies to provide their visions of the future, and Mr. Clinton, in his final such address, offered a view that, while promising, sees menace on many fronts.</p>
        <p>On a crisp New England day with the Thames River sparkling at his back, Mr. Clinton said that the larger issue for leaders is to maintain a balanced security strategy, one with diplomatic and economic elements as well as military ones.</p>
        <p>''Globalization is tearing down barriers and building new networks among nations and peoples,'' he said. ''The very openness of our borders and technology, however, also makes us vulnerable in new ways.''</p>
        <p>While the Internet and developments like the growth of democracy are heartening, ''we must understand the other side of the coin as well,'' he said. ''The same technological advances are making the tools of destruction deadlier, cheaper and more available, making us more vulnerable to problems that arise half a world away, to terror, to ethnic, racial and religious conflicts, to weapons of mass destruction, drug trafficking and other organized crime.''</p>
        <p>In cataloging some of the issues that he said should become part of any new discussions of national security, Mr. Clinton also touched on part of the presidential debate.</p>
        <p>Democrats have sought to portray Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the Republican candidate, as mired in a narrow military vision of national security no longer appropriate in a post-cold-war world. That was a theme of an address delivered last month by Vice President Gore, the presumed Democratic nominee.</p>
        <p>Thus, Mr. Clinton's long remarks about global warming were a gesture of support for Mr. Gore, whose ''new security agenda'' includes global warming, and who has been criticized by Republicans who say that scientists disagree about how great a threat it is.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Clinton said that unless greenhouse gas emissions are cut, ''most scientists are convinced that storms and droughts will intensify as the globe continues to warm. Crop patterns will be disrupted, food supplies will be affected, and the seas will rise so high they will swallow islands and coastal areas.''</p>
        <p>He said that the revolution in miniaturization in commonplace items like telephones will eventually also mean that biological, chemical and even nuclear weapons will be able to be put in packages small enough to transport easily.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton announced $300 million in new money to help law enforcement agencies deal with new threats. Mr. Clinton disparaged critics who objected to the White House's listing the global spread of AIDS as a national security threat. Diseases like AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, he said, ''can ruin economies and threaten the very survival  of nations and societies.''</p>
        <p>Africa now has 70 percent of the world's AIDS cases, and some employers, he said, now hire two people for each job vacancy, assuming one is going to die from the disease.</p>
        <p>''With malaria,'' the president said, ''people now discuss in common parlance, 'airport malaria,' something people can get in any international airport in any country in the world because we're all traveling around and bumping into people from other countries.''</p>
