        <p>Coal-burning utility companies and coal producers, disturbed by public acceptance of the idea that burning fossil fuels will change the climate, are deciding whether to go national this fall with an ad campaign they tried in three markets earlier this year.</p>
        <p>The advertising effort was tried out in Flagstaff, Ariz.; Fargo, N.D., and Bowling Green, Ky.

        <p>Coal-burning utility companies and coal producers, disturbed by public acceptance of the idea that burning fossil fuels will change the climate, are deciding whether to go national this fall with an ad campaign they tried in three markets earlier this year.</p>
        <p>The advertising effort was tried out in Flagstaff, Ariz.; Fargo, N.D., and Bowling Green, Ky. The campaign produced nearly 2,000 requests to a toll-free telephone line for more information, said Gale Klappa, a vice president of the Southern Company, a coal-using utility based in Atlanta.</p>
        <p>The goal of the campaign, according to one planning document, is to "reposition global warming as theory" and not fact.</p>
        <p>In Bowling Green, an ad showed a cartoon horse in earmuffs and scarf and said, "If the Earth is getting warmer, why is Kentucky getting colder?" Another, with a cartoon man bundled up and holding a snow shovel, appeared in Minnesota and substituted "Minneapolis" for "Kentucky."  'Another Viewpoint'</p>
        <p>"Those who are predicting catastrophe have been very effective at getting their message across in national media, and in so-called 'public service' announcements," Mr. Klappa said in a telephone interview. "But there is another viewpoint, a substantial viewpoint from a body of reputable scientists, and that viewpoint has really not been made available to a large majority."</p>
        <p>A packet of internal correspondence and other information relating to the campaign was provided to The New York Times by the Sierra Club, the San Francisco-based environmental group that favors taking steps to reduce the risk of global warming. The organization had apparently been given the materials by someone who disagreed with the campaign's goals or approach.</p>
        <p>Many climatologists are alarmed by the rising concentration in the Earth's atmosphere of carbon dioxide and other gases that they say will trap the sun's heat, raise temperatures and change rainfall patterns around the world. But scientists differ as to the extent of climate change or the speed with which it will occur.  More Punch Wanted</p>
        <p>The three scientists who form a "science advisory panel" for the campaign said in telephone interviews that the salient element in two of the ads, that some areas might be getting cooler, did not contradict the theory of global warming. But one of the three, Robert C. Balling Jr., director of the office of Climatology at Arizona State University, said in a telephone interview that the advertising campaign designers felt that an ad that simply discussed the contradictory state of evidence for global warming would not have enough punch.</p>
        <p>Dr. Balling and another member of the panel, Dr. Patrick J. Michaels, Virginia's climatologist and a professor of environmental sciences at the University of Virginia, have both asked to have their names removed from future mailings. Dr. Balling, who taped radio ads used in Flagstaff, said some people who heard the ads "did not like the idea that I was coming on the radio" and acting as "a mouthpiece" for a private group.</p>
        <p>Dr. Michaels said that with only three names on the mailing, people would identify him as the source of the information, while he was not, in fact, the author, and that the size of the panel was so small that it made the position appear scientifically unpopular.</p>
        <p>The third scientist on the panel, Dr. Sherwood B. Idso, an adjunct professor of botany and geography at Arizona State, said it was not clear whether adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere would result in global warming or cooling, but that it would probably be beneficial because it would increase plant growth.</p>
        <p>A scientist not affiliated with the campaign, Dr. John W. Firor, a climatologist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Center for Atmospheric Research, in Boulder, Colo., said in an interview that pointing out that a single location ran against the predicted trend was "a straw man."  Name Search</p>
        <p>Preparing for the test campaign, the organizers commissioned opinion surveys by Cambridge Reports, the Massachussetts research organization, to explore public attitudes toward global warming. Among the issues explored by Cambridge Reports was a name for the group, to conform with the acronym "ICE."</p>
        <p>A Cambridge Reports document in the packet advised the group to adopt Information Council on the Environment rather than Informed Citizens for the Environment, because the latter name was "perceived as combining the attributes of activist nd technical sources."</p>
        <p>Cambridge Reports also suggested strategies like telling people that "some members of the media scare the public about global warming to increase their audience and their influence," according to documents in the packet.</p>
        <p>The survey also showed, said the consultants, that "members of the public feel more comfortable expressing opinions on others' motivations and tactics than they do expressing opinions on scientific issues."</p>
        <p>Mr. Klappa said in an interview that the advice was unsolicited and had not been followed.  Division Among Utilities</p>
        <p>The utility industry is divided on the question of global warming. Two California utilities, Southern California Edison, the nation's second-largest utility after the Pacific Gas and Electric Company, and the Los Angeles Water and Power Department, the largest municipal company, volunteered in May to cut their carbon-dioxide emissions by 20 percent in the next 20 years. Most of the savings, they said, would come from efficiency improvements in lighting, motors and cooling that would pay for themselves.</p>
        <p>The Arizona Public Service Company, which serves Flagstaff, declined an invitation to participate in ICE. Mark De Michele, president and chief executive, did not reply to repeated phone calls seeking comment. But he told The Arizona Daily Sun in May, "The subject matter is far too complex and could be far more severe than the ads make of it for the subject to be dealt with in a slick ad campaign."</p>
        <p>The Edison Electric Institute, a utility trade group based in Washington that also helped organize the ICE campaign, takes the position that because of the possibility that climate change is a real threat, steps should be taken to cut carbon-dioxide output if those steps are justifiable for other reasons -- for example, saving money through higher efficiency or reducing the output of sulfur dioxide from power plants. That chemical causes acid rain.</p>
