        <p>THE research required 45,000 miles of driving and 14 months of living in a tent, but Dr. Camille Parmesan, a California biologist, has come up with what scientists say is the clearest evidence so far that global warming is forcing living species to move toward the poles and to higher altitudes.</p>
        <p>Experts have long predicted that many organisms would shift their ranges in response to climatic change, just as they have several times in the past. But good evidence of such movement in response to the modest warming of the last century has been lacking.</p>
        <p>Now, in a study that is said to be the first of its kind to cover a species' full geographic range, Dr. Parmesan has found that the range of a western butterfly, the Edith's checkerspot, has shifted northward by about 100 miles.</p>
        <p>In the summers of 1992 through 1994, Dr. Parmesan, an expert on the checkerspot, made on-the-spot surveys of more than 100 previously recorded populations of the butterfly from Mexico to Canada and eastward to Colorado. By comparing what she found with previous records, she discovered a pattern of local extinctions and colonizations that taken together, documented the northward movement of the species.</p>
        <p>The shift, she said, is surprisingly large for the relatively small average warming of the earth's surface, about 1 degree Fahrenheit, over the last century. And since she took into account other possible causes of the movement, she said, her study strongly suggests that warming is the cause of the change.</p>
        <p>''What my study shows is that we're apparently already seeing an effect, even though this is a small warming,'' Dr. Parmesan said. The effect ''is stronger than I expected,'' she said. Dr. Parmesan is a researcher at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis at the University of California at Santa Barbara. A report on her study, conducted while she was at the University of Texas at Austin, appears in the current issue of the journal Nature.</p>
        <p>It is an important paper, said Dr. Peter Kareiva, an ecologist at the University of Washington in Seattle.  ''People have hypothesized a good deal about how species are going to respond to climate change, but we don't have any good data prior to hers.''</p>
        <p>Mainstream climatologists say the warming of the earth's surface over the last century has probably been caused at least in part by emissions of heat-trapping waste industrial gases like carbon dioxide. They predict that the warming will continue, most likely amounting to about 3.5 degrees by the end of the next century if emissions are not reduced. By comparison, the world is 5 to 9 degrees warmer now than in the depths of the last ice age.</p>
        <p>The predicted warming is expected to cause widespread climatic, ecological and economic dislocation.  When the great ice sheets advanced and retreated, the ranges of countless creatures, not to mention entire forest and grassland ecosystems, moved with them. Some ecologists say that a further warming could consign some species to extinction by eliminating their habitats. Among these are the monarch butterfly, the edelweiss and the polar bear.</p>
        <p>Several recent studies have documented local population shifts, but these have been considered inconclusive because they were insufficient to show a range shift for the species as a whole: they could indicate merely a local expansion or contraction of a population. Moreover, other factors besides warming might explain the changes; local populations of wild species might be eliminated by local air pollution or changes in land use, for instance.</p>
        <p>Dr. Parmesan began by combing museum and amateur collections of the checkerspot, along with researchers' field notes, for information about its past distribution. In this way she was able to pinpoint more than 600 sites where the butterflies formerly lived over the last century.</p>
        <p>She eliminated from consideration sites altered over the century by human activities -- construction, overgrazing or logging -- that would exterminate or otherwise affect butterfly populations. She also eliminated sites affected by urban air pollution and those that could not be clearly located from the records. Ultimately she pared the list down to 151 essentially pristine checkerspot habitats, a large sample distributed over the species' full range. As it turned out, these unspoiled sites were more heavily concentrated in the northern and southern ends of the range, where development is sparsest, and where the signs of a shifting range would be manifest.</p>
        <p>Existing up-to-date records on butterfly populations made it unnecessary to visit about 20 percent of the sites. Dr. Parmesan drove to all the rest to make her on-the-spot census.  This involved looking for adult butterflies, caterpillars and eggs as well as host plants where the females lay their eggs and on which the hatched caterpillars feed. The Indian paintbrush and other members of the snapdragon family are especially favored.</p>
        <p>Driving a ''ratty old'' 1977 four-wheel-drive vehicle, she surveyed sites for four months each in 1992 and 1993 before graduating to another vehicle for a six-month stint in 1994. Toward the end of that stint, she said, the camping-out ''started to get tedious; I really wanted to watch TV and have a hot shower and a microwave to heat stuff up in.''</p>
        <p>The payoff came when her data revealed an increase in net extinctions (more extinctions than colonizations) in the southern end of the range and a decrease in net extinctions in the northern end over the century. Populations in Mexico were four times as likely to be extinct than those in Canada, she discovered.</p>
        <p>She also found that mountain populations were more robust at elevations above 8,000 feet. The butterflies occur up to 13,000 feet, above which there is no vegetation to support them. Those high-altitude populations do better when cold and snow moderate, Dr. Parmesan said, leading her to suggest that a general warming at the higher elevations might be responsible for the mountain butterflies' robust condition. But she did not find an accompanying increase in extinctions at lower altitudes, as would be expected. So the evidence on altitude shifts caused by climatic change ''isn't as clean'' as that for a shift in range, she said.</p>
        <p>Other studies have shown that the checkerspot's population dynamics are sensitive to climate, she said, adding that gradual climate change affects not the butterfly itself but the host plants: by changing the growing period of the plants, it interferes with the butterflies' reproduction schedule.</p>
        <p>Predators and parasites might affect population dynamics, but Dr. Parmesan said that their distribution did not increase or decrease with latitude. While she has tried to account for all possible causes of the shift aside from global warming, she said, ''I cannot say that climate warming has caused the shift; what I can say is that it is exactly what is predicted from global warming scenarios, that the butterfly's population dynamics are sensitive to climate and that other, smaller studies around the world have indicated evidence for northward shifts of species ranges.''</p>
        <p>''When you put it all together,'' she said, ''the picture that's coming out is that climate warming is affecting wild organisms.''</p>
        <p>Conclusive evidence, she wrote in Nature, will come not from a single study that seeks to analyze all possible variables, but from repeated full-range studies of other species in other regions.</p>
