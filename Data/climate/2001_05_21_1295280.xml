      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial opposes action by Bush administration and some members of Congress, pressuring some countries to reject global treaty signed by former Pres Bill Clinton creating international criminal court; says efforts are straining America's already uneasy relations with allies and limit administration's flexibility on important national security matters; says administration would better serve American interests by trying to change provisions of court it considers harmful</p>

        <p>Unhappy that President Clinton signed the global treaty creating an international criminal court, some officials in the Bush administration and some members of Congress are trying to get Washington to pressure other countries to reject it. This effort would strain America's already uneasy relations with its allies and limit the administration's flexibility on important national security matters. The Bush administration would better serve American interests by trying to change the provisions of the court it considers harmful.</p>
        <p>The international criminal court will be able to prosecute those accused of genocide, crimes against humanity or war crimes. The treaty establishing the court has been signed by 139 nations, and so far 31 have ratified it. When 60 countries ratify, which is likely over the next few years, the court will begin work.</p>

        <p>Unhappy that President Clinton signed the global treaty creating an international criminal court, some officials in the Bush administration and some members of Congress are trying to get Washington to pressure other countries to reject it. This effort would strain America's already uneasy relations with its allies and limit the administration's flexibility on important national security matters. The Bush administration would better serve American interests by trying to change the provisions of the court it considers harmful.</p>
        <p>The international criminal court will be able to prosecute those accused of genocide, crimes against humanity or war crimes. The treaty establishing the court has been signed by 139 nations, and so far 31 have ratified it. When 60 countries ratify, which is likely over the next few years, the court will begin work.</p>
        <p>Several top Pentagon officials fear that American troops serving in countries that have ratified the treaty might be arrested on false charges and sent to The Hague for trial. While it is important to guard against politically motivated prosecutions, the court already has numerous safeguards to ensure that it deals only with the most serious cases, is staffed by respected and reasonable judges, and would take jurisdiction of a case only after a suspect's own national court system had exhausted its own options.</p>
        <p>Opponents of the court would like an ironclad guarantee that the court would never try an American. Absent such a commitment, they want to block creation of the court by pressing countries not to ratify the treaty. This position may prevail in the administration, although more moderate officials would prefer to see Washington simply renounce its own signature of the treaty. The House, for its part, recently passed a bill that would require America to cut off military aid to most countries that ratify the treaty, unless they pledge never to surrender an American to the court. The bill also authorizes Washington to use force to rescue Americans -- even from the Netherlands, where the court will be based.</p>
        <p>The administration's wisest course is not to try to undermine the court. It probably cannot stop 29 more nations from ratifying the treaty, and to attempt to do so would further alienate allies that are already wary of President Bush's desire to build a missile shield and his decision to withdraw the United States from the Kyoto agreement on global warming.</p>
        <p>America would also lose its remaining influence in shaping the court, and there are upcoming decisions that matter to Washington, such as the definition of new crimes and selection of judges. The international criminal court is going to be a reality. If the Bush administration feels the safeguards protecting Americans from show trials are inadequate, it should try to strengthen them, not waste global influence in a futile attempt to prevent the court's establishment.</p>
