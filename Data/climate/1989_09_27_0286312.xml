        <p>LEAD: If a gas is compressed to almost the density of a liquid, it often begins to act like a liquid. The Union Carbide Corporation plans to take advantage of this property to eliminate large amounts of harmful solvents in the paints that are sprayed on automobiles, appliances and furniture.</p>
        <p>If a gas is compressed to almost the density of a liquid, it often begins to act like a liquid. The Union Carbide Corporation plans to take advantage of this property to eliminate large amounts of harmful solvents in the paints that are sprayed on automobiles, appliances and furniture.</p>
        <p>Solvents are used as carriers in paints. They help transfer the pigment and binder chemicals to the surface being painted and then quickly evaporate, leaving a dry surface. Unfortunately, these chemicals combine with oxides of nitrogen in the atmosphere to produce toxic ozone, which can damage lungs and irritate eyes, and their use is being restricted.</p>
        <p>The Union Carbide system would substitute carbon dioxide compressed to more than 1,000 pounds per square inch for 30 to 70 percent of the solvents in spray paints. Formulated with less solvent, the paints would be thicker, but the liquid-like carbon dioxide would be mixed with it as a thinner just before spraying to produce the proper viscosity.</p>
        <p>''Carbon dioxide becomes 'the great pretender,' '' said K. L. Hoy, a company official. ''It pretends to be a solvent and even outdoes it for some purposes.'' Once the paint is sprayed, the carbon dioxide acts like a normal gas and disperses.</p>
        <p>The paint and coatings industry is one of the nation's largest users of industrial solvents, consuming 4.4 billion pounds a year, the company said, so the potential for reducing air pollution is large.</p>
        <p>Unlike volatile solvents, carbon dioxide is neither toxic nor flammable. It is, however, a contributor to the ''greenhouse effect,'' which is blamed for global warming. But because the gas to be used will be a byproduct of other chemical operations, the company said, its use as a pseudo-solvent would not put any additional carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.</p>
