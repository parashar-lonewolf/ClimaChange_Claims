        <p>At new talks on global warming in New Delhi, the United Nations official overseeing a 1992 climate treaty said the world was unlikely to achieve proposed reductions in heat-trapping gases unless the United States, the biggest source, cuts its emissions. President Bush has endorsed voluntary measures to slow growth in emissions, but not reduce them. The official, Joke Waller-Hunter, told Reuters, ''If you look at the current policies taken in the U.S., it's unlikely'' that targets set under the Kyoto Protocol, a 1997 addendum to the treaty, will be met. The Kyoto pact was signed by the Clinton administration but rejected last year by Mr. Bush.</p>
