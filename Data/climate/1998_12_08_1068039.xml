        <p>MARC A. MATSIL personifies an environmentalist cliche: think globally, act locally. When he thinks of global warming, his first thought is the threat that rising water levels pose to Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island.</p>
        <p>Mr. Matsil, who is 42, is chief of the Natural Resource Group of the New York City Department of Recreation and Parks. His job includes protecting Gotham's ecosystems, cleaning up old landfills, making sure public works projects don't run roughshod over the environment, fighting the effects of oil spills and winning lawsuits against polluters -- more than $60 million over the last decade. He has also spearheaded the Parks Department's aggressive acquisition of 2,000 acres of wetlands and woodlands on the fringes of the city.</p>
        <p>''He can show why a swamp is a treasure,'' said Henry J. Stern, the Parks Commissioner, who hired Mr. Matsil in 1986. ''He is a spectacular public figure.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Matsil grew up in the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn and graduated from Columbia University, where he took a seminar with the anthropologist Margaret Mead. She observed that her student had probably spent more time in Europe than he had west of Pennsylvania. ''It shows in your psyche,'' she said. ''You need to get out West.''</p>
        <p>He joined the National Park Service and spent the next two years studying a tiny flower growing in alpine meadows on Mount Rainier. Mr. Matsil then moved to Alaska, where he worked as a wildlife biologist. Among other tasks, he counted grizzlies. He helped write a wildlife management plan for Gates of the Arctic National Park. He loved kayaking in wild rivers, and he named mountains after his parents and friends.</p>
        <p>On a 1986 trip back to Brooklyn to see his family, Mr. Matsil sent a resume to the New York City Parks Department on a lark. Mr. Stern asked him in for an interview, and asked him to be his assistant. Within two years, he was named the agency's top employee. He became a fierce opponent of developers, whose paid proponents he calls ''biostitutes,'' and of even other agencies when he thinks they threaten natural areas. ''He doesn't yield,'' said Jeannie Flatow, who, as chairwoman of the New York City Soil and Water Conservation District, has fought many battles with him.</p>
        <p>Mr. Matsil's cleverness -- and his ability to make the global local -- was demonstrated last year when he persuaded the Federal Government to contribute some of the money Exxon paid in fines for its enormous Alaskan oil spill to restore natural systems in Central Park.</p>
