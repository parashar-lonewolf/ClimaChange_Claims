        <p>What better way to celebrate Earth Day on April 22 than to answer test questions about Mother Earth. To meet state standards, the New York Board of Regents recently revised high school exams in global history and geography and in earth science -- though it's now called ''physical setting'' to reflect a broader scope (or perhaps not to offend the other planets). Below, questions from the August exams.</p>
        <p>Physical Setting/Earth Science</p>
        <p>1. The apparent rising and setting of the Sun, as viewed from Earth, is caused by . . .</p>
        <p>a. Earth's rotation</p>
        <p>b. Earth's revolution</p>
        <p>c. the Sun's rotation</p>

        <p>a. 110 million kilometers</p>
        <p>b. 220 million kilometers</p>
        <p>c. 390 million kilometers</p>
        <p>d. 850 million kilometers</p>
        <p>4. A cycle of Moon phases can be seen from Earth because the . . .</p>
        <p>a. Moon's distance from Earth changes at a predictable rate</p>
        <p>b. Moon's axis is tilted</p>

        <p>5. Which two gases in Earth's atmosphere are believed by scientists to be greenhouse gases that are major contributors to global warming?</p>
        <p>a. carbon dioxide and methane</p>
        <p>b. oxygen and nitrogen</p>
        <p>c. hydrogen and helium</p>
        <p>d. ozone and chlorine</p>
        <p>6. The average temperature at Earth's North Pole is colder than the average temperature at the Equator because the Equator . . .</p>

        <p>b. receives more intensive insolation</p>
        <p>c. has more cloud cover</p>
        <p>d. has a thicker atmosphere</p>
        <p>7. On a certain day, the isobars on a weather map are very close together over eastern New York State. To make the people of this area aware of possible risk to life and property in this situation, the National Weather Service should issue . . .</p>
        <p>a. a dense-fog warning</p>
        <p>b. a high-wind advisory</p>
        <p>c. a heat-index warning</p>
        <p>d. an air-pollution advisory</p>
        <p>8. During which phase change of water is the most energy released into Earth's environment?</p>
        <p>a. water freezing</p>

        <p>a. color</p>
        <p>b. density</p>
        <p>c. origin</p>

        <p>10. Which of these common rocks is formed from the solidification of molten material?</p>
        <p>a. rock gypsum</p>
        <p>b. slate</p>
        <p>c. rhyolite</p>
        <p>d. coal</p>
        <p>GLOBAL HISTORY AND GEOGRAPHY</p>
        <p>1. ''I am lucky enough to have been involved for half a century with work, mostly in East Africa, that very much belongs to everyone, since it concerns the human origins that are common to the whole human race.'' -- Mary Leakey, ''Autobiography''</p>
        <p>In this quotation, the author is implying that early humans. . .</p>
        <p>a. migrated from Africa to Eurasia</p>
        <p>b. first appeared in Africa</p>
        <p>c. invented tools and mastered the use of fire</p>
        <p>d. appeared shortly after the Neolithic Age</p>
        <p>2. One reason early civilizations developed in China, Egypt and the Tigris-Euphrates Valley in Mesopotamia is because . . .</p>

        <p>b. climate and geography favored agriculture</p>
        <p>c. rivers contributed to nomadic lifestyles</p>
        <p>d. natural barriers provided protection from invasions</p>
        <p>3. One reason for the growth and success of ninth-century cities like Baghdad, Constantinople and Ch'ang-an (Xian) was that they . . .</p>
        <p>a. were part of the Roman Empire</p>
        <p>b. tolerated religious diversity</p>
        <p>c. traded only with people from their immediate region</p>
        <p>d. were located on major trade routes</p>

        <p>a. national monarchies</p>
        <p>b. the Roman Catholic Church</p>
        <p>c. elected parliaments</p>
        <p>d. the Byzantine emperors</p>
        <p>5. One way in which the 12 Tables, the Justinian Code and the Napoleonic Code were similar is that they . . .</p>
        <p>a. emphasized social equality</p>
        <p>b. provided a written set of laws</p>
        <p>c. established democratic governments</p>
        <p>d. proposed economic goals</p>
        <p>6. The Boxer Rebellion, the Salt March and the Iranian Revolution were reactions against . . .</p>
        <p>a. Mongol rule</p>
        <p>b. rapid industrialization</p>
        <p>c. Western influence</p>
        <p>d. economic depression</p>
        <p>7. The American and French Revolutions were turning points in global history because the results of these revolutions . . .</p>
        <p>a. led to the abolition of slavery</p>
        <p>b. inspired other peoples seeking democracy and independence</p>
        <p>c. marked the end of European influence in the Western Hemisphere</p>
        <p>d. demonstrated the need for strong international peacekeeping organizations</p>
        <p>8. Which geographic factor most limited the growth of Latin American unity of the early 19th century?</p>
        <p>a. the region's diverse landforms</p>
        <p>b. most of the region's rivers flowed north to south</p>
        <p>c. the region's location close to the Equator</p>
        <p>d. the region's lack of natural resources</p>
        <p>9. During the late 1900's, the Sahel region of Africa has been faced with problems resulting from . . .</p>
        <p>a. increasing desertification</p>
        <p>b. the lack of rainfall from the monsoons</p>
        <p>c. the effects of acid rain</p>
        <p>d. water pollution</p>
        <p>10. Which conclusion can be drawn from these situations?</p>
        <p>* Nuclear accident at Chernobyl in the former Soviet Union</p>
        <p>* Dumping of toxic waste in the ocean</p>
        <p>* Cutting down the rain forest in Africa and South America</p>
        <p>a. Environmental problems need global solutions.</p>
        <p>b. The fall of the Soviet Union has caused severe environmental hazards.</p>
        <p>c. Technology has helped the world stop polluting the environment.</p>
        <p>d. Only nations that create environmental problems will suffer from them.</p>
