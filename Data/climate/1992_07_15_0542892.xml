        <p>Unremarkable and circumspect to a fault. That fairly describes the foreign policy ideas in the platform adopted yesterday by a Democratic Party eager not to make waves. Though the chapter on national security promises "a compelling vision for global leadership at the dawn of a new era," what it delivers is a cursory grab-bag of generalities mixed with a few brighter passages -- in short, a squandered opportunity for leadership.</p>
        <p>The best that can be said is that the platform does no harm: it does not bind Bill Clinton and Al Gore to premature or doctrinaire strategies. Thus it calls for considering, without mandating, new sanctions against South Africa. It speaks of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel without saying the United States Embassy should be moved there from Tel Aviv.</p>

        <p>Unremarkable and circumspect to a fault. That fairly describes the foreign policy ideas in the platform adopted yesterday by a Democratic Party eager not to make waves. Though the chapter on national security promises "a compelling vision for global leadership at the dawn of a new era," what it delivers is a cursory grab-bag of generalities mixed with a few brighter passages -- in short, a squandered opportunity for leadership.</p>
        <p>The best that can be said is that the platform does no harm: it does not bind Bill Clinton and Al Gore to premature or doctrinaire strategies. Thus it calls for considering, without mandating, new sanctions against South Africa. It speaks of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel without saying the United States Embassy should be moved there from Tel Aviv.</p>
        <p>It condemns Cuban tyranny without endorsing new embargoes. It says Washington should be "sensitive" to Greek protests about Macedonia's name without endorsing Athenian objections.</p>
        <p>On national security, the party has it both ways. It calls for "substantial" savings on arms while insisting that "America is the world's strongest military power, and we must remain so." It fails to make the vital connection between these cuts and a new strategy for economic renewal. And though the platform calls for multilateral peacekeeping, it makes no mention of America's shameful delinquency in paying United Nations dues.</p>
        <p>More creditable are the party's humane protests against the denial of asylum to Haitian refugees and its call for a plan and timetable for reducing world hunger. And the party commendably calls for a vigorous if flexible commitment to promoting human rights, notably in China.</p>
        <p>The platform comes closest to breaking new ground in its language on the global environment. It urges America to lead the campaign against global warming and ozone depletion, and for a biodiversity treaty. As important is the explicit commitment to spend more on family planning programs in third world countries -- positions that differ sharply from those of the Bush Administration.</p>
        <p>The pity is that the platform as a whole fails to realize the promise of its parts. The Democrats missed a chance to spell out, in coherent fashion, the dangers and opportunities in a world of democratic ferment and turbulent nationalism, a world with too many guns and still not enough butter.</p>
