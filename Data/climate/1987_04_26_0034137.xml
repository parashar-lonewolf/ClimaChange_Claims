        <p>LEAD: The psychological state of Michael K. Deaver, a former Presidential aide, when he gave grand jury and Congressional testimony could become an issue in his perjury trial, legal sources say.</p>
        <p>The psychological state of Michael K. Deaver, a former Presidential aide, when he gave grand jury and Congressional testimony could become an issue in his perjury trial, legal sources say.</p>
        <p>A ''Notice of Intention to Introduce Expert Testimony'' filed by Mr. Deaver has been sealed by Federal District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson at the request of Mr. Deaver's attorneys.</p>
        <p>But legal sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said it was apparently filed under a rule of criminal procedure requiring defendants to notify the prosecution of their intent ''to introduce expert testimony relating to a mental disease or defect or any other mental condition of the defendant bearing upon the issue of his guilt.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Deaver's notice was filed earlier this week, the same day the defense submitted its pretrial motions, as required by law.</p>
        <p>A defense sometimes used in perjury cases is the use of an expert witness who says the defendant's nervousness or stress impaired his ability to give accurate and complete answers under oath.</p>
        <p>Randall Turk, one of Mr. Deaver's attorneys, declined to comment, saying the notice was under court seal.</p>
        <p>Mr. Deaver is charged in a five-count indictment with giving false answers under oath when he testified before a House subcommittee and a Federal grand jury that investigated his lobbying business for possible ethical violations. The trial is scheduled to begin June 8.</p>
        <p>Mr. Deaver, former White House deputy chief of staff, is accused of lying to the Investigations Subcommittee of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce by failing to fully disclose his efforts to arrange a meeting between a South Korean official and President Reagan.</p>
        <p>The indictment also accuses Mr. Deaver of lying to the grand jury about lobbying activities in behalf of Puerto Rican business interests and Trans World Airways, and about the degree of his involvement in the acid rain issue while he was at the White House.</p>
        <p>Mr. Deaver left the White House in 1985 and became a lobbyist for the Government of Canada, which was seeking an agreement with Washington to control acid rain.</p>
        <p>The indictment charges that Mr. Deaver lied when he denied participating in meetings at which acid rain was discussed.</p>
        <p>The grand jury was convened by the independent counsel, Whitney North Seymour Jr., to investigate allegations that Mr. Deaver violated the Ethics in Government Act by lobbying former administration colleagues.</p>
