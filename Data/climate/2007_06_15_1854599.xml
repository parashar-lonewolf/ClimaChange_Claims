        <p>In ''A Spectrum of Disputes'' (Op-Ed, June 11), Paul T. Shattuck and Maureen Durkin suggest that we cannot prove that there is an autism epidemic. This reminds me of the argument for the last 20 years that there was no ''proof'' of global warming.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In ''A Spectrum of Disputes'' (Op-Ed, June 11), Paul T. Shattuck and Maureen Durkin suggest that we cannot prove that there is an autism epidemic. This reminds me of the argument for the last 20 years that there was no ''proof'' of global warming.</p>
        <p>Absolute cause-and-effect proof in science takes decades to achieve. Meanwhile, the scientific and political establishment ''fiddled while Rome burned,'' and the planet grew warmer.</p>
        <p>Any parent of school-age children knows, anecdotally, that there are far more autistic children these days than when we were in school. These are not kids who are ''a little different''; these are kids who have very limited speech, if any speech at all. Kids who cannot communicate effectively. Kids who have limited ability to function in society.</p>
        <p>Whether the increase in autism is 273 percent (as the State of California study states) or a 3,500 percent increase (as the federal data on special education report), there is no doubt that the incidence of severe, life-affecting autism has grown dramatically. It is immoral to question its existence simply because our scientific knowledge has not yet figured out why it has increased.</p>
        <p>Peter L. Weinberger  Los Angeles, June 12, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I strongly agree with Paul T. Shattuck's and Maureen Durkin's conclusions about the growing number of children with autism. But the ''epidemic'' of children with autism is only one piece of the puzzle.</p>
        <p>As a mother whose 3-year-old son was recently diagnosed with a form of autism, I constantly struggle with the question ''why me, why our family?'' There are so many questions to be answered about autism, but we should not squander valuable resources doing regressive analysis to determine if we are, in fact, experiencing an epidemic.</p>
        <p>We need to properly finance research to determine the cause of autism, and more important, the federal government needs to provide millions of dollars to the states, which have been shouldering the burden of an underfinanced mandate to educate these children.</p>
