        <p>The European environment commissioner, Margot Wallstrom, criticized an executive of Boeing as being nonchalant about the environmental effect of the company's proposed high-speed jet. Ms. Wallstrom criticized comments made by Harry Stonecipher, vice chairman of Boeing, in a recent interview with The Times of London in which he accused critics of the so-called Sonic Cruiser as riding the environmental bandwagon. Ms. Wallstrom said the hour saved on a trans-Atlantic flight would not be worth the 35 percent increase in fuel use and the increase in carbon dioxide emissions that Boeing projects for the plane, which will travel at 95 percent of the speed of sound.</p>
