        <p>IT is the most rigid of cosmic laws: there is no free lunch. In the sense understood by physicists and chemists, it means that matter and energy can never be created or destroyed, and if they turn up in one place, they must be taken away from another.</p>
        <p>The results of the latest National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, released last week, may cast doubt on at least the literal truth of that dictum.

        <p>IT is the most rigid of cosmic laws: there is no free lunch. In the sense understood by physicists and chemists, it means that matter and energy can never be created or destroyed, and if they turn up in one place, they must be taken away from another.</p>
        <p>The results of the latest National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, released last week, may cast doubt on at least the literal truth of that dictum. They reveal that the percentage of overweight American adults has crept up steadily since the 1970's and has now reached 64.5 percent. Whether because of free lunches, junk food or sheer couch-bound inanition, Americans are collecting a great deal of pouchy matter and caloric energy about them, and have been for decades.</p>
        <p>It is called fat. But the accumulating bulk of the overlunched nation, be it by dim sum, tapas, mezedes or matso-ball soup, still has to respect the no-freebie conservation laws. So if we are getting fatter, what in the universe is losing weight?</p>
        <p>Transforming the survey findings into raw physics is not a straightforward matter, said Katherine Flegal, a senior research scientist at the National Center for Health Statistics at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who led the obesity study. But in their most boiled-down version, the statistics suggest that the average American adult gained roughly 8.7 pounds in one 8.5-year span alone, at the tail end of the millennium. ''America's getting heavier,'' Dr. Flegal said, politely refusing to use the word ''fat'' even when pressed.</p>
        <p>The fat contains energy -- about seven calories of it in each gram, said Jules Hirsch, a professor emeritus at Rockefeller University and physician-in-chief emeritus of the Rockefeller Hospital. So, over those especially gluttonous 8.5 years, the most simplistic estimate suggests that the average American put about 18,000 calories into storage if two-thirds of the gain was fat, a typical number.</p>
        <p>On an individual level, those numbers are hardly impressive (an average male adult takes in about 2,500 calories a day), but when converted into simpler energy units and multiplied over the entire adult population, they imply that America is pouring 51 million watts into what amounts to a national ''fat battery,'' every second of every day.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, the energy in that battery has to come from solar energy striking Earth that might otherwise be stored in the cells of plants and animals, or contribute to the warmth of inanimate objects like oceans. But since about a thousand watts of solar energy typically falls on every square yard of Earth (5.3 trillion watts in Delaware alone), the amount of sunlight blocked by fat people's shadows is probably greater.</p>
        <p>How about the bulk itself? That comes to around a billion pounds (neglecting the increasing numbers of Americans, as all these calculations do). But in 2002, the American wheat crop alone -- presumably the source of some of the carbohydrates that helped fuel the weight gain -- amounted to some 1.6 billion bushels, or roughly 90 billion pounds. Our girth is buried deep behind the decimal points of nutritional poundage in America.</p>
        <p>More interesting is the chemical and environmental impact, however tiny, of the fattening population. And in this respect, at least, fat has an analogue in living matter -- from stems and leaves and worms and such -- that dies and decays in forests and fields and eventually becomes part of the soil.</p>
        <p>That organic matter contains carbon, which is therefore prevented from burning, combining with oxygen and becoming carbon dioxide -- a principal cause of greenhouse warming. In similar fashion, the fat would produce carbon dioxide if ''burned,'' or metabolized by its bearers.</p>
        <p>''A person gaining weight under these circumstances is actually storing carbon atoms,'' said Rudolph Leibel, director of the division of molecular genetics at Columbia University.</p>
        <p>Once again, the answers are more complicated and approximate than they sound, said Dr. Leibel, who repeatedly asked for assurances that his calculations would not be presented as a whacked-out theory for combating global warming. (They will not be.) The number at first sounds substantial: very roughly, 300,000 tons of carbon dioxide a year does not go into the atmosphere because carbon is being stored in America's fat.</p>
        <p>But in 2000, fossil fuel combustion from transportation alone pumped 1.8 billion tons of carbon dioxide into Earth's atmosphere. So this novel solution to our environmental troubles falls apart. Unless, that is, we decide to get fat much, much faster.</p>
