        <p>To The Living Section:</p>
        <p>"Root Beer: A Flood of Memories, a Sip of Foam," by Eben Shapiro  [ July 22 ] , discussed the various brands of root beer available today, but neglected to tell us about the history of the drink. Getting a cold drink out of a can is fine for today's generation, but the romance, the nostalgia and, incidentally, the "kick" are missing.</p>
        <p>I remember visiting my Aunt Edie in Vermont many years ago. She lived at the edge of Rutland, raised chickens, baked her own bread and cake, and brewed her own root beer. She would put up several dozen quarts in Mason jars and set them aside in the cellar to "work."</p>
        <p>The recipe is quite simple. In those days you could buy a bottle of Hire's root beer extract in any grocery or drugstore. I remember selling it in our drugstore in Newark in the 1920's. The formula was printed on the box. Basically, it called for a small quantity of the extract, water, sugar and a bit of yeast. The ingredients were mixed, the sugar dissolved and the mixture poured into the jars, which were tightly capped.</p>
        <p>The brew began to work in short order, generating carbon dioxide (the fizz) and alcohol. This is basically the same procedure and reaction in the making of wine and champagne.</p>
        <p>Once in a while, inevitably, one of the jars would explode -- never a major loss, because there were always plenty of jars in reserve. Opening the first jar of a batch was a time for tasting and celebration.</p>
        <p>The single dominant flavor in root beer is sassafras, a volatile oil found in the root of the sassafras bush. This plant grows wild throughout the Eastern United States. If you walk in any forest or suburban area that is a bit wild you will find sassafras bushes. The plants have up to four types of leaves, described as a left-handed mitten, a right-handed mitten, a three-finger and a plain ovoid leaf. If you scrape the root, you will smell the fragrant sassafras oil.  NATHAN SHALIT  Morristown, N.J.</p>
