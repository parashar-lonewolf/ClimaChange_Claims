        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Reports From Four Fronts in the War on Warming'' (April 3): Robert O. Mendelsohn is quoted as saying that it is easier to sell the idea of reducing greenhouse emissions to industrialized countries when it seems that we are ''all in this together.'' This is certainly true, so Dr. Mendelsohn would be wise to keep trying to sell it. We are all still on the same collision course with climate change, and the crash will come sooner than expected for the industrialized world if it continues to consider itself beyond harm.</p>
