        <p>The Dow Chemical Company said yesterday that it would cease normal production and sale of ozone-depleting methyl chloroform by Dec. 31, 1995, the deadline recently suggested by President Bush for a halt to such operations in the United States.</p>
        <p>MCF, as the chemical is commonly called, is widely used in industrial cleaning and in aerosols and coatings. Dow said annual sales have fluctuated between $100 million and $200 million in recent years, with more than 60 percent of the sales made outside the United States.</p>

        <p>The Dow Chemical Company said yesterday that it would cease normal production and sale of ozone-depleting methyl chloroform by Dec. 31, 1995, the deadline recently suggested by President Bush for a halt to such operations in the United States.</p>
        <p>MCF, as the chemical is commonly called, is widely used in industrial cleaning and in aerosols and coatings. Dow said annual sales have fluctuated between $100 million and $200 million in recent years, with more than 60 percent of the sales made outside the United States.</p>
        <p>"Expediting our global phase-out of methyl chloroform is in the best interest of both the company and the environment," said David T. Buzzelli, Dow's vice president and director of environment, health and safety.</p>
        <p>Dow makes MCF at Freeport, Tex., and Stade, Germany, and is currently working to develop water-based alternatives. No layoffs are anticipated in connection with the phase-out.</p>
        <p>MCF is among a group of ozone-depleting substances selected to be phased out under provisions of various international agreements and national regulations. Other such substances include chlorofluorocarbons, halons, carbon tetrachloride and hydrochlorofluorocarbons.</p>
        <p>The international Montreal Protocol set a deadline of 2005 for the worldwide phase-out. Small amounts of MCF will continue to be produced for a few uses, like cleaning medical devices, for which the Government has determined there are no effective substitutes.</p>
