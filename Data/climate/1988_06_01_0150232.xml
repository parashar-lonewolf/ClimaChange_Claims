        <p>LEAD: BESET by the trend toward moderate drinking, wine sales continued to decline for the fifth straight year in 1987, and the slide is expected to continue this year.

        <p>LEAD: BESET by the trend toward moderate drinking, wine sales continued to decline for the fifth straight year in 1987, and the slide is expected to continue this year. According to figures compiled by Impact, a trade newsletter, the wine market declined 1.8 percent last year, to 192.3 million cases. That was almost 28 million cases below the 1982 high of 220 million.</p>
        <p>BESET by the trend toward moderate drinking, wine sales continued to decline for the fifth straight year in 1987, and the slide is expected to continue this year. According to figures compiled by Impact, a trade newsletter, the wine market declined 1.8 percent last year, to 192.3 million cases. That was almost 28 million cases below the 1982 high of 220 million.</p>
        <p>Distilled spirits were off 1.9 percent last year, to 164 million cases. Citing pressure from health and fitness advocates and groups working against drunken driving, Impact concluded that ''the downward trend attributable to moderation has yet to run its course.''</p>
        <p>For the first time, sales of California varietal wines surpassed those of imported table wines. Sales of California varietals rose 19 percent, to 28.6 million cases, Impact said, while imported table wines were off 21.1 percent, to 27.6 million cases. Import price increases, caused by the weak dollar and the emerging popularity of white zinfandel, were behind the varietal surge, Impact said.</p>
        <p>A varietal wine is named after the grape that is its principal constituent, like cabernet sauvignon, chardonnay or zinfandel. The improved position of domestic varietals came at the expense not only of imports but of the so-called generics that still dominate the American wine market. A generic is a blend, usually inexpensive, sold as California burgundy or chablis. The E. &amp; J. Gallo Winery's Hearty Burgundy is probably the best-known generic. The generics, better known as jug wines, were off 3 percent, at 79 million cases. Even so, they accounted for 56 percent of the United States table-wine market, according to Impact. California varietals make up 20 percent, imports 20 percent and the wines of other states, 4 percent. Over all, California wines were up only 1.2 percent and would have been down considerably if not for the big increase in sales of varietals.</p>
        <p>Sparkling wines, which had shown remarkable growth - 8.6 percent annually from 1975 through 1985 - were off 1.4 percent, to 18.5 million cases last year. It was the second straight decline for sparkling wine, a somber note the industry seems to prefer to ignore. Some 45 sparkling wines are produced in California, with almost as many new ones in the planning stage.</p>
        <p>Only French Champagne bucked the downward slide in sparkling wines. Shipments in 1987 were up almost 7 percent over 1986, despite major price increases resulting from the weaker dollar. Imported sparkling wines from Italy, Spain and other countries were down about 3 percent, Impact said.</p>
        <p>The white zinfandel fad, like the wine-cooler boom, which has been losing headway, is a peculiarly American phenomenon. Coolers, which are made of fruit juices, inexpensive white wine or wine concentrate, water and sugar, are no long considered to be in the wine category among alcoholic beverages. White zinfandel is a wine, but it is to wine what the roller derby is to sports: a contrived item produced for a special market.</p>
        <p>It came about originally as a way to satisfy the enormous demand in this country for white wine. Zinfandel is a red-wine grape, but like all wine grapes, its juice is white; the color comes from the skins. Separate the juice from the skins and the finished wine will be white, or almost. To create the white zinfandel that is so popular, the wine makers add sugar to sweeten the wine and a bit of carbon dioxide to make it tingle.</p>
        <p>White zinfandel is classified as a table wine and is especially popular as a cocktail or bar wine. Its producers say that more and more of it is served with meals, however. At 7.9 million cases, white zinfandel sales were up 39 percent last year over 1986.</p>
        <p>Sutter Home Winery in St. Helena, Calif., which says it invented the wine, sold 2 million cases of white zinfandel last year, an increase of 55 percent over 1986. Sebastiani Vineyards in Sonoma, Calif., sold 800,000 cases, for an increase of 60 percent.</p>
        <p>As in the past, marketing pundits have been predicting that white zinfandel is a ''transitional wine'' that will lead partisans of wine coolers to more ''serious'' wines. A serious wine is a dry red or white table wine. Coolers, too, are sometimes described as transitional. In their case, the exodus is said to be from beer.</p>
        <p>Over the past two decades, half a dozen sweet wines or wine-based products have been promoted by the industry as stepping stones to serious wine. First there were the Portuguese roses; then came cold duck; then Boone's Farm and other so-called apple wines; then bottled sangria, and, before coolers, lambrusco.</p>
        <p>All these products are still around and enjoy varying degrees of success. And perhaps there have been crossovers to dry table wines. But mostly these products indicate that Americans like drinks that are cold, sweet, and perceived as light: low in alcohol and calories.</p>
        <p>Some people progress from ''Tom and Jerry'' to ''Masterpiece Theater''; others just switch over to ''The Flintstones.''</p>
