        <p>TEN years after recapturing the Continent, Dwight D. Eisenhower calculated that the lessons of D-Day could be usefully applied in persuading  Congress to lace the land with highways.

        <p>TEN years after recapturing the Continent, Dwight D. Eisenhower calculated that the lessons of D-Day could be usefully applied in persuading  Congress to lace the land with highways. His administration dreamed up the National System of Interstate and Defense Highways and argued that these roads were not only about economic development, they were about national security.</p>
        <p>''In case of atomic attack on our key cities,'' he wrote in 1955, ''the road net must permit quick evacuation of target areas, mobilization of defense forces and maintenance of every essential economic function.''</p>
        <p>Half a century later, the highways he built can barely handle a 5 p.m. crush of commuters in their S.U.V.'s, much less a panicky evacuation of the capital. But if he were alive today, the old five-star might smile to hear the latest Clinton White House strategy. The president and his national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, have taken up a mantra that granting permanent ''normal'' trading status to China isn't just about profit opportunities, it's also about national security. At the same time, the administration has labeled the AIDS crisis in Africa a threat to national security, and Vice President Al Gore has raised similar fears with his ''new security agenda,'' which includes global warming.</p>
        <p>Without question there is a case to be made that economic chaos, disease and climatic upheaval can all trigger political nastiness. So all of this new labeling raises a question: Just when does a big problem turn into a national security threat?</p>
        <p>On trade with China, the Clinton administration argument is that granting normal trade status would reassure the Chinese that America isn't trying to hem them in.</p>
        <p>''From a national security point of view, it would in my view be a very, very unwise and precarious move to say that the United States doesn't care whether they're part of the world community or not,'' President Clinton told an insurance group last week, a theme he repeated nightly as he tried to win over 40 or so legislators who were still undecided about the China bill.</p>
        <p>Only days before, the White House was  arguing that the spread of AIDS in Africa would lead to economic collapse, political instability and civil wars that might eventually require American intervention.</p>
        <p>''I'm not saying that we have a short list of national security threats and East Timor is now off and AIDS is on it,'' Mr. Berger said in an interview. But strife has many origins, he said: ''If it creates instability, chaos, conflict and war, that has national security implications.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, meanwhile, used a foreign policy speech last weekend to argue for the need for ''forward engagement'' (presumably a Gore-ism for trying to think ahead). He ticked off -- in no particular order of priority -- pandemics, economic inequality, global warming and the digital divide as potential security problems that had to be nipped in the bud.</p>
        <p>In Mr. Gore's case, the political calculation is obvious: he is trying to portray his opponent, George W. Bush, as a man caught in what he termed a cold-war mindset that sees national security only in the most conventional terms.</p>
        <p>But it is still unclear whether the new Democratic relabeling of issues is just shrewd political marketing -- to Democrats who don't like trade deals, and to Republicans who don't care for foreign aid, particularly when it involves AIDS -- or a truly new agenda for an age of new global threats.</p>
        <p>It is hard to tell. As the Clinton presidency winds down, the definition of national security threats has gotten ever fuzzier. Even some senior members of the administration worry privately that the White House regularly overplays its hand and should reserve the national security argument for events tightly linked to the prospect of the United States becoming involved in conflict. ''There's a significant risk of crying wolf,'' one of the president's top security advisers concedes. ''This isn't Sputnik,'' he added, in another allusion to the Eisenhower years, when appeals for education funds could be based on fears that the Russians were well ahead in the race to build the first I.C.B.M.'s.</p>
        <p>Clearly there is a strong moral argument for helping the destitute ravaged by AIDS, in Africa or elsewhere. And no doubt the disease could lead to political instability. But so can poverty, and the 1.3 billion people who live on less than a dollar a day trigger meetings at the World Bank these days, not in the Situation Room.</p>
        <p>Advisers to Mr. Bush, eager to portray the current occupants of the White House as long on butter and short on guns, carry the argument one step further: by making the list of security threats too long, they argue, the Clinton administration risks taking its eye off more imminent threats. Or as Paul Wolfowitz, dean of the school of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University and one of those advisers, wrote recently, AIDS in Africa and the environment are serious problems, but calling them  national security threats carries ''the implication that conventional security is no longer something we need to worry much about.''</p>
        <p>But this is also an administration repeatedly stung by the criticism that its foreign policy has been a series of belated reactions, rather than the product of any global strategy. So Americans may be ready to welcome anything resembling preparation for new crises, as long as it differentiates between real security threats, potential threats and social work. And it is possible -- though hardly certain -- that after a decade of unchallenged power and prosperity, Americans are ready to think about their national security in broader terms.</p>
        <p>A decade ago, any serious official who argued that admitting Communist China into a Western trade regime might change China's political culture would have been laughed out of the National Security Council. Today, even some Republicans sound a lot like Bill Clinton when it comes to talking about the benefits of exposing China to a Western-designed legal system or fueling the spread of the Internet. ''China's emergence as a world power is a classic security issue,'' said Richard Armitage, who has served several Republican presidents, ''and if getting them into the world trading system makes them more restrained, a better actor, then I'm for it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton's most potent argument may be the one he hasn't made in public, chiefly to avoid offending two of America's closest allies. In the first half of the 20th century, Germany and Japan lashed out in large part because they felt the world was constraining not only their military might, but their ability to manufacture and export. Any global system that reduces trade barriers, the theory goes, also deflates some of those pressures.</p>
        <p>But non-economic forces also cause wars, and it is a mistake, Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers acknowledges, to ''overemphasize the link between economic forces and future conflict.'' Perhaps that is why Mr. Clinton and Mr. Berger last week opened a new front in the China argument. Rather than argue the economic and political benefits of getting China into the tent, they made the case that keeping it out would court disaster -- that insulting China would strengthen the hand of the People's Liberation Army in its battle over China's direction with Prime Minister Zhu Rongji, the leader of China's move to a market economy. But if the Chinese economy opens too quickly -- forcing tens or hundreds of millions of workers in inefficient state-owned enterprises out of work -- Mr. Zhu could be blamed for that, too.</p>
        <p>Whatever one thinks of the logic, Mr. Clinton's national security case for letting China into the World Trade Organization seems to be winning some converts. ''The A.F.L.-C.I.O. has an answer to the economic arguments about this deal,'' one undecided congressman -- who asked not to be named -- said last week. ''But they don't have any answers on the security side.'' On the other hand, the effort to reclassify AIDS seems to have fallen flat. No one in either party is talking about reallocating the trillions saved by the Soviet Union's fall on international AIDS programs, or any other foreign aid.</p>
        <p>But China trade may be different. Eisenhower's highway system is now crumbling, and members of Congress want it fixed. A few who are on the fence about China have suggested that the place to fix the Interstate System is in their districts before Election Day. That might make them more amenable to the Clinton view of national security.</p>
        <p>Correction:  May 14, 2000, Sunday  Because of an editing error, an article last Sunday about national security issues truncated a comment from Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers. As reported, Mr. Summers said it was a mistake to ''overemphasize the link between economic forces and future conflict'' because noneconomic forces also cause wars. But the main point of his comment was, ''When people are prosperous and hopeful, they don't look for men on horseback.''</p>
