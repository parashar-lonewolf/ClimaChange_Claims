        <p>TRACKING the global cycling of water from sky to earth and back again, scientists had thought they could count on at least one thing. The movement of water through plants, it seemed, was simple: up into the roots and out through the leaves as vapor. But now they are discovering that plants are not the passive water vaporizers they had been thought to be. Instead, researchers have found an unsuspected detour in the routing of water. And this discovery may enhance the understanding not only of how plants interact with one another but how ecosystems function and even how climate can change.</p>
        <p>It turns out that in the night, many plants pull water up from deep in the earth and, rather than holding on to it to pass through their leaves the next day, they flush it out through their shallow roots into the ground around them. Biologists say that plants ranging from sagebrush in the arid steppes of Utah to sugar maples in the rainy forests of upstate New York appear to be acting as subterranean watering systems, drenching the soil and their thirsty neighbors.</p>
        <p>Dr. Todd Dawson, a plant ecologist at Cornell University who recently discovered that this phenomenon, which scientists are calling hydraulic lift, occurs in sugar maples, said that while transporting water out through a root system might not seem a particularly shocking thing for a plant to do, it was at first hard for biologists to believe. Why, they wondered, would a plant give up precious water?</p>
        <p>In fact, researchers studying the movement of water through plants using theoretical models had predicted hydraulic lift before it was observed. Water always flows from wet to dry areas; therefore, the scientists had reasoned that at night, when water does nt evaporate from plants' leaves, any water that the deep roots pull from underground should flow into the shallower roots and from there into the dry soil near the surface. But biologists, by and large, did not believe the models. Dr. John Baker, a soil scientist at the United States Department of Agriculture, who did the original laboratory work a few years ago to show that Bermuda grass was, indeed, a hydraulic lifter, explained that the question is not so much why a plant would leak water but how it could keep from leaking it.</p>
        <p>Around the same time, researchers found evidence that sagebrush in Utah was watering the hot, dry soils of the steppes. They were so surprised, they assumed something had gone wrong with their instruments.</p>
        <p>Dr. Jim Richards, a plant ecologist at the University of California at Davis, and his colleagues were seeking to measure long-term seasonal fluctuations in the steppes' soil moisture. To their surprise, these researchers found their sensors telling them that each night the soil around the sagebrush was moistening as if watered and then drying again during the day. After checking and rechecking their instruments, the researchers discovered that these small shrubs were, in fact, taking up as much as a quart of water each night and moistening the high desert and the thirsty, tussock grasses living nearby.</p>
        <p>"It was very surprising, something that we didn't expect at all," said Dr. Richards. "We're just beginning to really investigate the actual physiology of what's going on and the ecological implications."</p>
        <p>Scientists are finding the same phenomenon not only in arid-land plants, like sagebrush and the oaks of the California chaparral, but also in alfalfa, barley and maize, which can grow in much wetter climates, and even in plants like the sugar maple, which grows in wet environments.</p>
        <p>During the drought of the summer of 1991, Dr. Dawson, whose work appears in the current issue of the journal Oecologia, noticed that while many plants around Ithaca, N.Y., were wilting, those close to sugar maples seemed to be doing well.</p>
        <p>In such a season of intense water shortage, plants that are crowded together would be expected to suffer most because they would have to compete for precious water from the soil, or so the dogma of plant competition would have it. Yet paradoxically, the closer trillium, goldenrod and other plants were to sugar maples, Dr. Dawson found, the better they thrived. The farther away they were from the trees, the worse they fared, forming a striking gradient of wilt.  Maples Drench Their Neighbors</p>
        <p>As Dr. Dawson was to discover, these long-rooted sugar maples were as well equipped to pull water from deep in the soil as the desert sagebrush. Drawing upon this deep water, the trees were able to water their neighbors well. Dr. Dawson estimated that a 40-foot-tall maple was able to deliver between 40 and 60 gallons of water to the upper soil layers every night.</p>
        <p>Though of great interest to scientists, water, as ubiquitous as it is, can be difficult to track. Dr. Dawson was able to see just who was using whose water by taking advantage of the subtle differences between groundwater held deep below the surface and rainwater fresh from the sky.</p>
        <p>There are two different forms that the element hydrogen can take, heavy or light. As a result, water (H2 O, or two molecules of hydrogen and one of oxygen), can be either heavy or light, depending on which hydrogens it carries. Dr. Dawson found that he could distinguish water stored deep in the ground from summertime rainfalls because rain was richer in the heavier water.</p>
        <p>By looking to see what kind of water the nearby trillium and other plants were carrying, Dr. Dawson was able to see whether they were taking advantage of the lighter groundwater, which had been drawn up by the sugar maples, and not the heavier rainwater in the soil. In fact, many of the plants growing near the sugar maples were making good use of their proximity to these trees, using the water they were releasing to grow bigger and healthier.</p>
        <p>Dr. Terry Chapin, an ecosystem ecologist at the University of California at Berkeley, said this water sharing is particularly interesting because it turns ideas of plant competition on their head. Not only might it not be so bad to be near other plants, but in terms of getting enough water and dissolved nutrients, it might be quite good.</p>
        <p>But while the water supplied by hydraulic lifters can help their neighbors and would appear to increase the overall productivity of an ecosystem, large-scale movement of water is not always good. Dr. Chapin suggests that since hydraulic lifting can radically change the environment immediately surrounding plants, conservationists should be wary of introduced, foreign species that can perform such feats. In arid areas, he suggested, such plants would outcompete many native species and added that their presence could be disruptive to a plant community. Implications for Agriculture</p>
        <p>Other researchers have said that hydraulic lift might be important for agriculture as well, as a potential natural irrigation system. Deep-rooted plants interspersed with shallow-rooted but thirsty crops could provide water to regions otherwise difficult to irrigate. Dr. Baker said that, while yet untested, such an application for hydraulic lifters seemed promising.</p>
        <p>By all indications, native hydraulic lifters are likely to be common in many natural areas, and researchers hoping to manage or restore ecosystems say they will need to understand just what role these water-movers play.</p>
        <p>"The pieces in the puzzle of an Eastern forest are very, very complicated," said Dr. Gene Likens, director of the Institute of Ecosystem Studies in Millbrook, N.Y. "These new findings are an important part of helping to piece that puzzle together. I would assume that this will be important to understanding the management of an ecosystem like a forest."</p>
        <p>Dr. Chapin agreed, saying that one of the big challenges confronting ecologists today is understanding how ecosystems work well enough to be able to restore those that have been disturbed or destroyed. "Hydraulic lift," he said, "is the kind of effect from a species on the environment that's going to be critical in understanding how we can reconstitute the natural complexity of communities."</p>
        <p>Scientists say they are also having to reconsider the role that plants play in shaping the environment. "This is a very important finding and important work in general," said Dr. Likens. "It clearly means that plants are having an impact far beyond what it might appear just looking at a tree or a plant in a specific location."</p>
        <p>Dr. Chapin described the work as "really exciting." He added: "More and more people are recognizing that plants have a huge effect on their physical environment. This is the first time that it's been shown that plants can positively affect the water environment of the soil. They're not just passive recipients of what the environment doles out, but they basically determine what their environment is."</p>
        <p>Some researchers argue that scientists must now reconsider the role that these plants might play in global climate change, a process in which the global water cycle plays an integral role.</p>
        <p>Dr. David Rind, a climate research scientist at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in Manhattan, agreed, saying that more research on hydraulic lift is necessary. "It's not something that has gotten that high a degree of attention previously, and the more it's discussed and brought to light, the more people will be able to evaluate it. It's certainly not a part of most, and probably all, models right now." Researchers say that, in general, the role of plants in global water cycling has been ignored. Therefore, though scientists suspect that hydraulic lift will play some role, how big a role these plants can claim remains to be seen.</p>
