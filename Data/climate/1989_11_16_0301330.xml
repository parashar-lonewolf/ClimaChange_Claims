        <p>LEAD: To the Editor:</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The White House is to be commended for not rushing into a hasty agreement to apply controls on the emission of carbon dioxide, the principal greenhouse gas (news story, Oct. 27). Despite so-called international pressure, generated mainly by lower-level bureaucrats to force the hand of the President, and huge news media publicity about impending doom, there is considerable doubt in the scientific community about the greenhouse climate warming.</p>
        <p>John Sununu, White House chief of staff, rightly questions the economic wisdom of limiting use of fossil fuels, including oil and coal. Policies suggested are often counterproductive. Extreme conservation measures -e.g., rapidly replacing older energy-using equipment - waste money, resources and energy. We don't want to force people to throw out all cars but compacts. Many renewable energy sources (e.g., solar) are not yet competitive - or folks would be buying them without coercion.</p>
        <p>Many antipollution policies lower energy efficiency, putting more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere: methanol production uses up to 50 percent of the input energy; smokestack scrubbers lower the efficiency of electricity generation; chlorofluorocarbon phaseout means lower-efficiency refrigerators and air-conditioners.</p>
        <p>In any case, unilateral actions would produce only marginal results, slightly postponing the date when effective greenhouse gas content doubles. Even costly and coercive controls would merely shift the ''doubling date'' from perhaps 2040 to 2045. And studies show that carbon dioxide controls shift costs from developing to industrialized countries.</p>
        <p>Prudent policies exist: gradual improvements in efficiency in response to higher energy prices; a highway user fee (gasoline tax); nuclear energy wherever cost-effective. All these are worth doing even if there is no greenhouse effect. But is the public ready and are politicians courageous enough? S. FRED SINGER  Director, Science &amp; Environmental  Policy Project, Washington Institute  Washington, Oct. 31, 1989</p>
