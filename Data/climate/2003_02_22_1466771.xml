        <p>The pressure on President Bush to abandon his irresponsibly passive approach to global warming was ratcheted up this week. On Thursday the attorneys general of seven Northeastern states announced their intention to sue the administration -- in the person of Christie Whitman, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency -- for its failure to regulate power plant emissions of carbon dioxide, the main global warming gas, as required by the Clean Air Act.</p>
        <p>These same states frequently pressured Mrs. Whitman's Democratic predecessor, Carol Browner, to invoke various provisions of the act to reduce long-regulated pollutants like sulfur dioxide, which causes acid rain. The difference this time is that they are trying to get the federal government to pay attention to carbon dioxide, the one compound that remains completely unregulated despite mounting scientific evidence that it is likely to be the most dangerous pollutant of all.</p>
        <p>The Clean Air Act requires the E.P.A. to review and update standards governing power plant emissions every eight years. The lawsuit says that for 20 years the agency has failed to do these reviews. Had it done so, the suit contends, the agency would long ago have added carbon dioxide to the list of power plant emissions deserving of regulation -- especially since power plants account for nearly 40 percent of all the carbon dioxide emitted in America today.</p>
        <p>The suit is thus a direct challenge to one of several reasons President Bush had advanced for not moving more forcefully to control carbon dioxide. The reason he gave for renouncing the Kyoto Protocol, the agreement on climate change signed by the Clinton administration in 1997 and since ratified by about 100 countries, is that aggressively reducing emissions would be too expensive. He also insists that carbon dioxide is not a pollutant as defined by the Clean Air Act. That's the reason he gives for not including carbon dioxide in the clean air legislation he has sent to Congress.</p>
        <p>The lawsuit says this is poppycock. One section of the act explicitly recognizes carbon dioxide as a pollutant, alongside more familiar culprits like sulfur dioxide. In addition, carbon dioxide plainly falls within the act's definition of what a pollutant is and, no less clearly, it meets criteria necessary for the E.P.A. administrator, in this case Mrs. Whitman, to regulate it.</p>
        <p>The suit could fail. State challenges to federal policy are always iffy. But it may at least inspire honest discussion about how to control the largest single source of carbon dioxide in the world. And it may force the administration to explain a global warming strategy that is becoming increasingly indefensible.</p>
