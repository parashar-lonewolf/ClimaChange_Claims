        <p>LEAD: William K. Reilly, the new head of the Environmental Protection Agency, said today that he would enforce the nation's toxic waste cleanup law more aggressively than it has been up to now.</p>
        <p>William K. Reilly, the new head of the Environmental Protection Agency, said today that he would enforce the nation's toxic waste cleanup law more aggressively than it has been up to now.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reilly said that Congress and the country were disappointed with the performance of the agency on toxic wastes and that he had ordered an internal review aimed at ''revitalizing and to some degree redirecting'' the waste program.</p>
        <p>In order to create a climate more conducive to voluntary cleanups of hazardous waste sites, he said it would be necessary ''to carry a big stick and to be so aggressive in enforcing the law and pursuing the responsible parties'' that polluters have an incentive to act.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reilly added that he is committed to making the existing law work rather than seeking new legislation from Congress. Some environmental groups have expressed concern that segments of the chemical and insurance industries might seek to dilute the waste law under the guise of lobbying Congress for changes to make it more efficient. Headed Conservation Groups</p>
        <p>In his first interview since becoming Administrator of the E.P.A., Mr. Reilly outlined his agenda and gave his views on the current state of the environment and what needs to be done to revive and protect it. Mr. Reilly was president of the Conservation Foundation and the World Wildlife Fund before being appointed to head the E.P.A.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reilly said the Bush Administration needs ''to claim the environmental high ground and clarify a vision of the kind of country, environmentally, that we want.''</p>
        <p>In the past too much of the day-to-day administration of environmental laws has been ''defensive and responsive,'' he said, adding: ''People need to see the environment as a cause that is positive, hopeful and attractive. The costs that we bear to maintain the environment and improve it have to be seen as highly worthwhile investments in our future, as important as investments in education, science and defense.''</p>
        <p>By the standards of the early 1970's, in which gross pollution of water and air were the chief concerns, efforts to clean up the environment have been highly successful and the substantial investments in pollution control have been well spent, Mr. Reilly said.</p>
        <p>''That said, it is very discouraging that even some of the problems that were well understood and reasonably well defined persist,'' including protection of wetlands and reducing water pollution caused by runoff from farms and city streets. Ozone pollution that creates urban smog is still uncorrected and is going to be very ''painful and expensive'' to solve, he said. Dangers of Toxic Substances</p>
        <p>Since the 1970's, environmental experts have learned more about ''the pervasiveness of toxic substances in the environment,'' which constitute a significant unresolved threat, he said. Present laws on the use of pesticides and other toxic chemicals are not well equipped to control them, despite growing knowledge about their dangers, Mr. Reilly said. The process is excessively slow in getting ''bad chemicals'' off the market even after their risks have been documented, he complained.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reilly said international environmental issues, including global warming and the depletion of the atmosphere's protective ozone layer, must be given a much higher priority in Federal policy.</p>
        <p>''It is increasingly clear that the earth could be destabilized fairly rapidly in ways we do not yet have the legal or institutional means to address,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reilly repeated that strengthening the Clean Air Act is at the top of his immediate agenda. Among the other issues in which he takes a strong interest are these:</p>
        <p>* He will stress pollution prevention through such means as waste reduction and recycling. The country faces a crisis in disposal of solid wastes that will require the education of the public and strong action by state and local authorities, he said.</p>
        <p>* He expects President Bush to issue an order soon requiring that actions by the Federal government result in ''no net loss'' of the nation's dwindling wetlands.</p>
        <p>* He supports strong standards for the fuel efficiency of automobiles as one of the most attainable ways of dealing with both air pollution and energy supplies. The required gas mileage of cars should be increased, not lowered, he said. This stand is likely to put him at odds with other Administration agencies and the auto industry, which are pressing for a relaxation of fuel standards.</p>
        <p>In his first week, Mr. Reilly said, the amount of information across his desk is ''mind-boggling,'' and he has had to take of three briefcases crammed with papers.</p>
