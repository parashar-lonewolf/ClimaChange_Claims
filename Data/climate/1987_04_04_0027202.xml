        <p>LEAD: To the Editor:</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In ''Sacrificing Icecaps for Waste Dumps'' (editorial, March 3), you assert on the basis of a recent Environmental Protection Agency report that the agency has focused its efforts too much on cleanup of hazardous waste dumps and too little on other environmental problems.</p>
        <p>The E.P.A. report and the editorial suggest that agency priorities are guided more by public opinion than by comparisons of the risks of different environmental problems. But these views miss the crucial point: E.P.A. funding for all aspects of environmental protection is grossly inadequate.</p>
        <p>Right now the E.P.A.'s operating budget provides very nearly the same purchasing power the agency had in 1976 - before many of the programs to protect the public from hazardous wastes and toxic chemicals were put in place. The current operating budget is almost 20 percent lower in real dollars than the 1981 budget, and President Reagan's proposed fiscal 1988 budget would actually cut E.P.A.'s current operating funds.</p>
        <p>The E.P.A. report identifies several environmental problems that pose a high risk but have received relatively little agency effort. In this category are indoor air pollution, global warming as a result of fossil fuel combustion, and destruction of the earth's protective ozone layer by man-made chemicals. Without question, the E.P.A. should devote more resources to addressing these problems - but not at the expense of hazardous waste cleanup.</p>
        <p>To suggest that E.P.A.'s efforts at hazardous waste cleanup represent misplaced priorities is to lose sight of the greatest threat of all, the severe lack of resources and staunchly anti-regulatory outlook of this crucial regulatory agency.</p>
        <p>In no program area is E.P.A. in danger of overdoing it. In fact, E.P.A. has less than half of the funding needed to carry out its research and regulatory programs.</p>
        <p>What is needed is not so much a redirection of priorities but a renewal of commitment on the part of the Congress, the Reagan Administration and the E.P.A. itself, to see that the agency's mission is carried out with adequate funding and increased vigor. ALEXANDRA ALLEN  Staff Attorney  U.S. Public Interest Research Group  Washington, March 6, 1987</p>
