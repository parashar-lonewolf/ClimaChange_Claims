        <p>SENATOR JOHN KERRY's wife likes to say he'd be a president who ''loves history,'' but here's one historical fact he cannot be fond of: Just two of the scores of sitting senators who have ever sought the Oval Office actually got there, Warren G. Harding and John F. Kennedy.</p>
        <p>It is axiomatic that nearly every member of the Senate ponders a presidential bid -- four of the nine Democrats in this season's primary fight were members of the upper House, another one a graduate -- but they rarely win. Is this a statistical fluke?</p>
        <p>On paper, senators certainly seem like attractive candidates. They have dealt with a broad range of issues. They have proved themselves electable statewide. They have access to top fund-raisers. But does service in the Senate somehow backfire, turning otherwise successful politicians into bumbling candidates forced to defend lengthy legislative records the average governor -- or, better yet, general -- can avoid?</p>
        <p>''It is almost impossible to go through a 20-year record in the Senate and not be able to find things that might embarrass a candidate,'' observed the presidential historian Michael Beschloss. ''If you're a great Senate leader and you're running, people might think you're a hack. And then if you're a senator and you weren't a great leader, people might wonder why weren't you?''</p>
        <p>Which may be why Mr. Kerry's campaign aides rarely use the honorific he has earned in nearly 20 years on Capitol Hill, instead referring to the candidate only as ''John Kerry'' in news releases, travel schedules and when talking about him.</p>
        <p>Only 3 of the campaign's 18 television advertisements since April even mention his day job, describing him alternately as a combat veteran, former prosecutor, husband, father, ''advocate for kids,'' hunter, pilot, even hockey player.</p>
        <p>And in accepting his party's presidential nomination at the Democratic National Convention in Boston, as his opponents were quick to point out, Mr. Kerry spent just 26 seconds -- 73 of the 5,343 words in his speech -- talking about his time in the Senate.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Bush argues that his opponent is trying to hide a record of voting to raise taxes and cut defense, Mr. Kerry's advisers may be making a historically informed calculation about the rocky path from the Senate to the White House.</p>
        <p>In a paper published two years ago in Political Science Quarterly, Barry C. Burden, a professor at Harvard University, laid out the long odds: Of the 54 presidential elections since 1789, 15 saw current or former senators win; from 1868 to 1972, 16 percent of senators who sought their party's nomination got it, compared with 48 percent of governors; and from 1960 to 1996, while sitting senators made up more than a third of those running for president, just 11 percent won party nods and 2 percent the general election.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Kerry has already learned many times over, a Senate record -- he has cast some 6,000 votes since arriving in Washington in 1985 -- is easy ammunition. Hardly a day goes by without Mr. Bush's aides mentioning Mr. Kerry's 350 votes over the years for higher taxes (not mentioning that most were technical votes on minor amendments connected with balanced-budget packages). If not attacking his votes for higher gas taxes or against financing for the Iraq war, the Bush campaign is pointing to votes or hearings Mr. Kerry skipped while out campaigning.</p>
        <p>Then there is the way senators speak -- at length, often alone in the august hall but for a C-Span camera, with bonus points for detailed digressions and polysyllabic words.</p>
        <p>Indeed, on the campaign trail, Mr. Kerry is inclined to ''revise and extend'' the draft remarks circulated to reporters, often stepping on his own applause lines by stuffing extra examples and explanations into the bumper-sticker slogans.</p>
        <p>''You talk differently,'' explained Thomas E. Mann, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. ''You tend to emphasize the specifics and the intricacies of legislation. It's hard to describe a Senate career in a way that makes you appear attractive as a president.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, the last sitting senator to win a major-party nomination, Bob Dole, resigned his seat mid-campaign in 1996, declaring it better to run as ''a private citizen, a Kansan, an American, just a man.'' Rather than make the case for Mr. Dole's election, ''the business of the Senate had the potential to derail the issues and ideas of his candidacy,'' recalled Scott Reed, the Republican strategist who served as Mr. Dole's campaign manager.</p>
        <p>Pointing to Mr. Bush's attacks on Senator John McCain in the Republican primaries four years ago, Mr. Reed said that the complexities of the Senate make it ''easy for your opposition to twist your vote against a certain budget authorization so it looks like you're against funds for cancer victims.''</p>
        <p>Or, in the case of Mr. Kerry, make it look as if he's against weapons systems, prescription drugs, rural health care and renewable energy.</p>
        <p>Unlike Mr. Dole, the senators who made it to the White House, Harding in 1920 and Kennedy in 1960, had unremarkable Capitol Hill careers, each having spent only one term in the Senate. ''They had non-records, so to speak,'' said the historian Robert Dallek. ''There wasn't a single major bill that attached to either Harding or Kennedy's name, so they could defend against attacks on their record.''</p>
        <p>When Mr. Kerry does talk about his Senate years, he is most likely to mention his work with Mr. McCain on normalizing relations with Vietnam, turning the topic back toward Lieutenant Kerry, the Navy combat veteran.</p>
        <p>In television advertisements, the campaign ignores the senatorial similarity of Mr. Kerry and his running mate, John Edwards, introducing them by saying, ''one is a combat veteran with over 30 years of experience'' and ''the other is the son of a mill worker.''</p>
        <p>The only television ad that devoted any real time to the past 19 years is ''Lifetime,'' in which 20 of the 60 seconds concern Mr. Kerry's time in the Senate, saying he led ''the fight for health care for children,'' and ''broke with his own party to support a balanced budget.''</p>
        <p>Mary Beth Cahill, Mr. Kerry's campaign manager, said voters are focusing on the future, not on ''votes on amendments to the defense appropriations bill in 1985, which is where the Bush campaign seems to want to spend most of its time.''</p>
        <p>Another top Kerry strategist, John Marttila, said, ''It's not a question of who's the senator and who's the governor, who's the whatever, it's going to be two individuals standing next to each other in three debates, it's these two guys.''</p>
        <p>Looking back, the 1972 Democratic nominee, George McGovern, said his Senate record was what made him a serious presidential contender, not something to hide.</p>
        <p>''I never felt it was a handicap to me,'' Mr. McGovern said, noting that he had not helped the odds any. ''I don't think I lost because I was a senator.''</p>
