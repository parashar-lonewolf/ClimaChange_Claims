        <p>WHEN the carmakers Nissan, Renault, Hyundai and BMW wanted to investigate the feasibility of using fuel cells to power automobiles, they came to Connecticut.</p>
        <p>When Verizon wanted to install fuel cells as a reliable source of power for its call routing hub on Long Island, it came to Connecticut.</p>
        <p>A data processing center in Germany uses fuel cells from the state, as does a brewery in Montana, a hotel in New Jersey and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power.</p>
        <p>''Obviously, Connecticut is the cradle of fuel cell development,'' said Michael T. Kirk, a spokesman for Representative John B. Larson, a Democrat from Connecticut, who sponsored a forum on the industry last spring. ''The congressman's view is that it's critical we in Connecticut work to maintain our status as the leaders of an incredibly important technology.''</p>
        <p>Fuel cells generate energy through an electrochemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen. Because the fuel is not burned, there are none of the emissions associated with conventional power plants.</p>
        <p>In the 1960's, a United Technologies Corporation plant in South Windsor began making fuel cells for the Apollo space missions. Today, the company has installed 255 large commercial fuel cells in 19 different countries and is producing 25 to 30 new ones every year.</p>
        <p>Connecticut is now home to three of the largest fuel cell companies in the world. Besides United Technologies, there are Fuel Cell Energy Inc. in Danbury and Proton Energy Systems in Wallingford.</p>
        <p>Smaller companies are starting to spring up as well, such as Nxegen in Middletown and GenCell Corporation in Southbury.</p>
        <p>''It's a technology that has been struggling for years,'' said John Carbone, the chief operating officer at Nxegen. ''But it's been developed to the point where it's right on the verge of being a commercial technology.''</p>
        <p>The state Department of Economic Development and Community Development estimated that $300 million worth of fuel cell products have been manufactured and shipped from Connecticut, more than any other state. While the industry is still small, with some 1,400 employees in the state so far, the figure still represents more than one-third of the people working on fuel cells in North America.</p>
        <p>In addition, the largest fuel cell installation in the world is in Connecticut, a 1.2 megawatt generating complex -- enough energy to supply more than 1,000 typical homes -- at the Connecticut Juvenile Training Center in Middletown, constructed by United Technologies.</p>
        <p>The Connecticut Clean Energy Fund has backed $10 million of fuel cell installations in the state. Fuel cells are an energy source that is efficient, reliable and environmentally friendly, and also represent perhaps the next wave of technology, said Arthur H. Diedrick, executive director of the state agency.</p>
        <p>''We have purposely tried to make Connecticut the fuel cell capital of the world,'' Mr. Diedrick said. ''When you look at the whole picture, I don't think we're making any false claims.''</p>
        <p>In addition to the private companies already here and the investment in fuel cell installations as demonstration projects, the state has established the Connecticut Global Fuel Cell Center at the University of Connecticut to work with industry to develop the technology.</p>
        <p>''A lot of investors are calling Connecticut the 'next Silicon Valley' because of its role in this emerging technology,'' said Bryan T. Garcia, program director at the Clean Energy Fund. ''This small state has a real global role to play in this issue.''</p>
        <p>The federal government has pledged $1.7 billion in fuel cell research over the next five years, and some state officials say Connecticut is poised to capture a large share of the funds.</p>
        <p>First Selectman Paul B. Eccard, of Waterford, has proposed taking advantage of some of the energy experience of Dominion Connecticut, which operates the Millstone nuclear power complex in his town, to develop a fuel cell research center in town, possibly at a now-defunct airport.</p>
        <p>''A lot of other areas of the world are moving very fast on this to bring down the cost per kilowatt hour, and we've been a town that has been big on energy technology since the 1960's, so I think this is a perfect fit,'' Mr. Eccard said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Eccard said he had been talking to Russian leaders he met through an exchange program, who are interested in doing collaborative research. He said they were interested in the potential to use fuel cells in remote sections of their country where there is an abundance of natural resources, but no electricity infrastructure.</p>
        <p>''I'm really just trying to act as a go-between between the two sides,'' Mr. Eccard said. ''There's a lot of potential for electric delivery capability right out of here, and we need to keep the communication open.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Garcia said that government studies were starting to take into account the impact of fuel cells on some of the gases associated with global warming, particularly the carbon dioxide associated with combustion.</p>
        <p>''For the first time we're projecting a dip in greenhouse gas emissions, which is a significant development,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The industry is attracting a significant amount of attention. Tony Blair, Britain's prime minister, has asked Connecticut to participate in the United Kingdom Carbon Trust because of its expertise in fuel cells. Over the last couple of months, international missions from Finland and Germany have visited the state for consultations, said Subhash Chandra, a technology officer for the Connecticut Clean Energy Fund.</p>
        <p>''It's not just the number of projects here, it's the quality of projects, and the quality of the data that we are able to collect, which is going to help advance the technology,'' Mr. Chandra said.</p>
        <p>Fuel cells are efficient and also whisper quiet.</p>
        <p>''Our electrical efficiencies are in the 45 to 47 percent range, then when you talk about the byproduct heat that's available in cogeneration plants, the combined heat and electrical efficiency is greater than 70 percent,'' said Steven P. Eschbach, director of investor relations for FuelCell Energy in Danbury, which has delivered 20 commercial fuel cells in the last year all over the world. ''An old-fashioned combustion plant in the same size range might be 25 to 30 percent.''</p>
        <p>Another advantage of fuel cells is that they can be set up quickly to service areas that might not be serviced by utility lines. Peter F. Dalpe, a spokesman for United Technologies, said that when power requirements grew at the police station in Central Park in New York City, it was going to cost $1 million to put in a new electrical line, and it would have required ripping up a large portion of the park. A fuel cell, installed for about the same cost, required no construction off the police station grounds.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dalpe said the cost of a fuel cell was prohibitive in locations that are served by utility wires, but as the technology gets better and more units are made, the cost will come down. And research is continuing into providing small fuel cells as a mobile power source, for everything from hand-held video games to automobiles.</p>
        <p>A Hyundai spokesman, Alfred E. Gloddeck, said that United Technologies' experience with fuel cells dating to the early days of the Apollo program was what drew the Korean automaker to Connecticut.</p>
        <p>''I always say, 'if it's good enough for the space program, it's good enough for Hyundai,''' Mr. Gloddeck said.</p>
        <p>Hyundai expects to have some small fleets of fuel cell-powered automobiles in use as early as next year.</p>
        <p>''These will all be prototype vehicles,'' Mr. Gloddeck said. ''For general transportation, just general passenger transportation, we think the fuel cell has enormous potential. That's our goal, but there is still the question of how long before we get there, because we want to do this right.''</p>
