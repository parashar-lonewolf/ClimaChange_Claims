        <p>Elements of a possible agreement on cutting industrialized countries' emissions of heat-trapping waste gases have begun to emerge from intensive negotiations here, and today it was widely believed that the countries could reach agreement on this central issue next week.</p>
        <p>But there was little apparent movement on a second key issue, that of the immediate role to be played by developing countries in controlling the gases, and that issue continued to threaten the overall prospects for the success of the talks. It also raised the possibility that while some sort of agreement might be achieved, the United States might find it unacceptable and refuse to sign what would be called the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
        <p>As the 10-day session on what to do about global warming reached its halfway mark, attention turned to the expected arrival on Monday of Vice President Al Gore and high-level ministers from more than 150 countries, marking the start of the talks' decisive final three days.</p>
        <p>Awaiting them will probably be the rough ingredients of an agreement on targets, timetables and structures for cutting rich nations' emissions of carbon dioxide and other atmospheric gases that scientists say are warming the atmosphere. ''I think the elements are there,'' said Raul Estrada-Oyuela of Argentina, the chairman of the talks.</p>
        <p>Pieces of an agreement ''are beginning to take shape,'' said Melinda Kimble, a senior State Department official who has led the United States delegation in the early phase of the Kyoto discussions. ''We need to tweak them a little more to get them to fit together.''</p>
        <p>One emerging element is called differentiation, an arrangement whereby countries would adopt different levels of emissions reductions, tailored to their particular national circumstances. Differentiation presents a way around an impasse over a uniform, flat-rate reduction target for everyone. The United States said for the first time on Monday that it would consider the differentiation approach.</p>
        <p>Initially, the Americans proposed a one-size-fits-all target of cutting average emissions levels in the period 2008 through 2012 back to 1990 levels. The Europeans proposed a flat-rate reduction of 15 percent below 1990 levels by 2010. Both sets of targets and timetables would be legally binding, and both remain formally on the table at least for now.</p>
        <p>A number of countries, including the United States, argue that the range of differentiation should be kept narrow. One way to achieve this would be simply to set a target range for reductions -- say, between 5 and 10 percent, or zero to 5 percent, below 1990 levels. Another way would be to adopt stringent objective criteria, based on countries' varying economic profiles.</p>
        <p>A key holdout on differentiation has been the European Union. Many other delegations find this stance unfair, since the European group proposes a form of differentiation for itself. Under what is called the European ''bubble'' proposal, Europe as a whole would be bound to a firm target. But some countries would be allowed to fall short of the target -- in one case, by 40 percent -- while others make up by exceeding it.</p>
        <p>The Europeans have been under intense pressure from the Japanese and the Americans to justify the bubble concept. Europe, in fact, has appeared on the defensive over the issue this week, and some insiders say the pressure on the bubble is a tactic to help extract concessions from the Europeans on other issues, including differentiation for all countries and emissions trading, a mechanism heavily favored by the United States.</p>
        <p>In emissions trading, a country or industrial company would be able to meet its emissions reduction target by cutting emissions itself or by buying reductions from another country or company that achieved excess cuts, or both.</p>
        <p>Proponents of this approach argue that it provides an incentive for companies and countries that find it relatively easy to cut emissions to go further than required and then profit by selling the excess to companies that find it harder or more costly to reduce emissions on their own. The proponents say this approach achieves reductions most efficiently and cheaply.</p>
        <p>The Americans say that market-based, cost-saving mechanisms like trading are essential to any long-term system for emissions reduction, and that at this early stage of a decades-long process such structural matters are as important as the reduction targets themselves.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the developing countries are continuing to insist that they will take on no further obligations -- beyond a general one requiring them to adopt measures to control greenhouse gases -- until the rich nations act. But unless they do, some key United States senators say, the Senate is unlikely to ratify any agreement emerging from Kyoto.</p>
        <p>The senators, in fact, have become more than shadow players in the talks. Several are observers here and have had discussions with a number of delegates. Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, said here yesterday that he believed the Senate would approve an agreement ''if it feels like all countries are reasonably and responsibly sharing in the solution.''</p>
        <p>No one expects the developing countries to take on the same commitments as the rich nations, and a number of possible options for strengthening developing countries' participation are being considered. One would be a legally binding commitment to limit the growth of developing-country emissions -- though not reduce them outright -- after about 2010.</p>
        <p>A proposal to begin talks next year leading to such commitments for all but the poorest countries by 2014 was offered formally tonight by New Zealand with American backing, and it ignited fierce opposition. The chairman of the developing country caucus, Dr. Mark Mwandosya of Tanzania, said his group would simply refuse to take part in the preparatory talks.</p>
        <p>Another option would be to allow developing countries to take on legally binding commitments voluntarily, as their economies grew and matured.</p>
        <p>A third option would be what is called ''joint implementation.'' In this arrangement, highly favored by the United States, a business or government in a rich country finances or provides the technology for a specific emissions reduction project in a developing country -- a more efficient, emissions-saving power plant, for instance. The donor country or company would share credit for any emission reductions.</p>
        <p>More than two dozen experimental pilot projects are now under way.</p>
        <p>A fourth option, proposed by Brazil and favored by the developing countries as a group, would require rich countries that fail to meet targets to pay into a fund that would finance the adoption of greenhouse-friendly energy technologies by developing countries.</p>
        <p>Voluntary solutions might not be acceptable to the Senate, Senator Baucus said. Senator Chuck Hagel, a conservative Nebraska Republican who heads a key committee, emphatically agreed and said that new developing-country commitments must begin at the same time as those of the rich nations.</p>
        <p>Some environmentalists here are urging the United States delegation to ignore the Senate and go for the best agreement possible. Ratification does not have to come immediately, they say, and in the meantime the United States can proceed with its own domestic emissions reduction program, as President Clinton has said it would do if no satisfactory agreement is reached here. Then, at some future date, the United States might ratify the treaty.</p>
        <p>Other interested parties, like Kevin Fay, who heads a moderate business group called the International Climate Change Partnership, say it would be better to put off discussions beyond Kyoto if it looks like no agreement acceptable to the Senate is possible. To do otherwise, he said, risks poisoning efforts to get Congress to approve funds for the domestic emissions-reduction programs.</p>
        <p>Not everyone is gloomy about the developing-country issue. Mr. Estrada had this to say: ''The only thing the developing countries are waiting for is for the developed countries to make commitments. The moment we have that, everything else will fall into place.''</p>
