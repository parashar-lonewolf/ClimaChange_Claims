        <p>LEAD: To the Editor:</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>President Reagan and Canada's Prime Minister Brian Mulroney met in Washington to discuss and resolve problems of mutual interest to the United States and Canada (front page, April 28). Unfortunately, their ensuing statements show that they have not been able to come to an understanding on acid rain, the thorniest problem between the two countries. It is also the costliest. According to our studies at the University of Miami, this year alone the damage to the two countries from acid rain, pollution and the greenhouse effect will add up to the staggering figure of $425 billion - about 10 percent of the gross product of the two countries.</p>
        <p>There was a proposal to spend $5 billion over five years to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions by 50 percent. This would not solve the problem, but only delay the harmful effects, e.g., damage done in one year would take two years.</p>
        <p>However, there is a permanent and economical answer to acid rain. If we change our energy system from the fossil-fuel system to the hydrogen energy system, there would be little or no pollution, little or no acid rain, and as a bonus, the greenhouse problem would also disappear.</p>
        <p>Canada has abundant hydro power potential to produce cheap hydrogen. Just last month, Marcel Masse, Canadian Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources, inaugurated a hydrogen production plant in Becancour, Canada, which produces hydrogen using hydroelectricity as cheaply as hydrogen produced from natural gas.</p>
        <p>When the environmental damage that is generated by fossil fuel is taken into consideration, the effective price of hydrogen becomes very much lower than that of coal, petroleum or natural gas.</p>
        <p>Low-cost Canadian hydrogen could be piped to the Northeastern United States for use in lieu of fossil fuels. Such a program, which could be implemented over 10 years, would:</p>
        <p>* Bring a permanent and economical solution to the acid rain problem, and thus remove the biggest cause of friction between two neighbors.</p>
        <p>* Reduce dependence on imported oil and strengthen the regional self-sufficiency and security.</p>
        <p>* Increase trade between the two countries.</p>
        <p>* Make the two countries leaders in hydrogen energy technology, and create new employment and export potential.</p>
        <p>* Result in the first binational hydrogen energy system project, which would be a model for the rest of the world to convert to hydrogen and erase acid rains, pollution and the greenhouse effect from the face of this planet. T. NEJAT VEZIROGLU  Director, Clean Energy Research  Institute, University of Miami  Coral Gables, Fla., May 9, 1988</p>
