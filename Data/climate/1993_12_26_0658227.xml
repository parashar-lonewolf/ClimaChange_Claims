        <p>AS HE DROVE ACROSS THE LONGVIEW BRIDGE over the Black River one day in the winter of 1985, David W. Stahle, a researcher at the University of Arkansas, gave a long, low whistle. He had come to the Cape Fear region of North Carolina in search of old trees that he could core for his ongoing climatic research, hoping for specimens as old as the 600- and 700-year-old stands he already knew about on other lonely rivers. What he found along the Black, though, defied every stereotype of the East Coast -- an untouched stretch of river bordered by bald cypresses that dated back at least 1,700 years. "Since one of the characteristics of these old trees is hollowness in the cores, there's no question in my mind that many of those trees are 2,000 years old," Stahle says. And little question that they are the oldest living things in eastern North America, the most venerable organisms this side of the bristlecone pines of eastern California. This place exists as much in time as in place; it was protected by the Washington-based Nature Conservancy in the wake of Stahle's discovery and is now a living museum of natural history -- a kind of Pleistocene park. "These trees -- these very trees -- had Carolina parakeets and ivory-billed woodpeckers in them," said J. Merrill Lynch, a protection specialist at the North Carolina chapter of the conservancy, as we paddled the sleepy river in the spring of 1993. "Now those species are both extinct. We don't want these old-growth forests to go the same way."</p>
        <p>Most of the clamor about old-growth forests has come from the West, where environmentalist pressure to protect remaining large stands of ancient woods brought a halt to logging on many Federal lands and led to President Clinton's timber summit and recent compromise plan designed to protect habitats for endangered species. But biologists and conservationists in the East have recently begun to realize that there is more original forest here than was long believed to be the case, scattered remnants of the mighty forest that greeted the arriving Europeans. These woods seem to harbor no equivalent of the spotted owl, which is dependent on old growth, but scientists argue that their preservation is crucial. The first conference on the topic was convened in August at the University of North Carolina in Asheville, an event that also marked the publication of Mary Byrd Davis's landmark catalogue of the region's untouched woods. Though "old growth" is notoriously hard to define -- there are those who insist on absolute virgin forest, while others make concessions for human intrusion that hasn't altered the basic character of a grove --researchers are becoming more aware of undamaged tracts, and of what can be learned from them. "We have entries from every state in the East," Davis says, "and new discoveries being made all the time. People are just beginning to realize what's out there."</p>

But biologists and conservationists in the East have recently begun to realize that there is more original forest here than was long believed to be the case, scattered remnants of the mighty forest that greeted the arriving Europeans. These woods seem to harbor no equivalent of the spotted owl, which is dependent on old growth, but scientists argue that their preservation is crucial. The first conference on the topic was convened in August at the University of North Carolina in Asheville, an event that also marked the publication of Mary Byrd Davis's landmark catalogue of the region's untouched woods. Though "old growth" is notoriously hard to define -- there are those who insist on absolute virgin forest, while others make concessions for human intrusion that hasn't altered the basic character of a grove --researchers are becoming more aware of undamaged tracts, and of what can be learned from them. "We have entries from every state in the East," Davis says, "and new discoveries being made all the time. People are just beginning to realize what's out there."</p>
        <p>The first rule when you're looking is to erase the postcard images of grandeur from your mind. Outside the Smokies and the Adirondacks, it's mostly 25 acres here or 50 acres there that by one fluke or another escaped the logger's ax. "We're dealing with little pockets of a landscape that's been totally disturbed, totally utilized," says Charles V. Cogbill, a Vermont ecologist, who has seen as many patches as anyone in the East. Usually, he says, the stands resemble the 20-acre patch of sugar maple, hemlock and yellow birch on Lord's Hill near his northern Vermont home. Though some of the trees are big and old, nothing is more characteristic, says Cogbill, than "old-growth dynamics," the replacement of dead trees by new ones. Wandering through the woods last spring, Cogbill spent as much time looking down as up -- "I'm a deadwood ecologist," he said. "I'm doing autopsies," checking rotting stumps for the progress of decay, looking at new seedlings pushing up through the ground.</p>
        <p>In some places the biology speaks louder than the written history. The historian Barbara McMartin, who next year will publish "The Great Forest of the Adirondacks," says as many as a half million of the park's six million acres may have escaped 19th-century loggers. "It was one man, one horse, one ax -- not really disruptive to the forest," she says. "You never see a stump in those tracts, there's a lot of dead and down trees. It feels old."</p>
        <p>Even in unprotected areas, say many researchers, there's more old growth than the traditional image of the cutover East would suggest. "It was an economically driven forest disturbance," says Stahle. "What that means is, they left a lot of low-end, uncommercial forest in its primeval condition. If you want to find some for yourself, look for harsh places. Look for rough ground."</p>
        <p>For some people even the scrappiest patches of original forest are filled with wonder. Robert Leverett and his son Rob Jr. are amateur old-growth sleuths who are credited with uncovering more ancient patches than anyone else in the East. Only an echoing series of exclamations allows one to track them as they bound down a steep slope above the Cold River in the Berkshire hills of western Massachusetts: "Dad -- over here. This ash is sooo good! This is ancient!" "Look at the bark on this yellow birch, will ya!" Careful researchers, always ready to pull out their tape measures and surveyor's inclines to record widths and heights, they also find their church in these forests. A former Air Force officer who currently teaches statistics and computer science to college students, Leverett is not your typical crystal-gazing New Ager, but he does have a theory: "In a very young wood, that forest is still sucking up energy as it grows, not giving it off. In the older stands, it's more in balance. I end up feeling a little higher. Not in any magnified way, but that balance seems to help the human organism."</p>
        <p>EVEN AS SCIENTISTS BEGIN TO SENSE THE richness of eastern old growth, the stands are coming under new threats. Some seem inexorable -- gypsy moth and hemlock woolly adelgid infestations have already wasted some ancient forests. Ozone pollution and acid rain continue to devastate others, and development is always a threat, especially on smaller sites -- one 50-acre Delaware tract will be turned into luxury housing this year, the streets all named for eastern wildflowers.</p>
        <p>But if the present is dark, the future could conceivably be brighter. A growing number of biologists are beginning to talk about "future old growth," about forests left to recover from the abusive logging of the past, until in time -- a matter of centuries -- they once again behave like natural forests. Much of the oldest woodland in the Southeast, for instance, is owned by the United States Forest Service, which contracts with private industry to cut timber. More than 60 percent of that national forest is scheduled to be cut at intervals of 60 to 120 years, says Dan Boone, an ecologist at the Wilderness Society -- a rotation much too short to sustain the diversity of the ecosystem. But, says William G. Martin, a Forest Service silviculturist -- silviculture is the science of growing trees -- "there's no question that in the East restoration of future old growth is going to be more important than protecting the little we've already got. It's going to be a major emphasis." Environmentalists have begun to call for a wholesale reappraisal of the role of Federal lands in the East, says Boone, protecting every meager patch of land that's left in order to preserve the region's biodiversity. Gary Miller, director of the environmental studies department at the University of North Carolina at Asheville, envisions the remaining pockets of eastern old growth as seeds for ecological corridors that might someday provide plants and animals with easy travel up and down the mountainous spine of the East. "We're talking about millions of acres, in order to stabilize the population declines that we're seeing," he says.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, small parties continue to scour the woods, weekend after weekend, trying to discover as yet unknown groves of old, old trees in overlooked parts of the East. One day last fall, Bob Leverett led a party out to hike an area near Lewey Lake in the south-central Adirondacks, land that old logging maps showed as devastated. But Leverett, driving down the road, had spotted some telltale craggy trees, and as he climbed higher up the slope he began to grow more excited. "Ooh, that's good," he said, measuring a yellow birch with a circumference of nearly 10 feet, pulling out his clinometer to declare a sugar maple 87 feet tall. Arizonan Dave Forman, a co-founder of Earth First and now a coordinator of the Wildlands Project, is along for the hike. "Even if I saw this back home, I'd say it was a big tree," he says as he pats a massive hemlock, its cinnamon-colored bark putting its age upward of two centuries.</p>
        <p>The day ends under a spruce, on a shaded and mossy hammock by a rushing stream. Leverett Sr. pulls out the surveyor's tools -- the spruce turns out to be exactly 100 feet, top to bottom. "That's a nice tree," says Leverett. "This is a very nice forest."  Bill McKibben is the author of "The End of Nature." He is at work on a collection of articles about environmental hope.</p>
