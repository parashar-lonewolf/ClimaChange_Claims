        <p>I saw corn salad, that hardy green also known as mache, coming up in a raised bed on Long Island. So why not scatter some mache seeds, as well as spinach, curly cress and other cold-loving greens, in a protected area like a raised bed on the south side of a wall, or in a cold frame? Seeds are cheap, it's fun to push against the outer edges of the season and those first greens of spring are like a tonic.</p>
        <p>Seeds of hardy annuals and vegetables, like broccoli, cabbages, lettuce and asters, can also be sown in a cold frame, if it gets plenty of sun and is out of the wind.</p>

        <p>I saw corn salad, that hardy green also known as mache, coming up in a raised bed on Long Island. So why not scatter some mache seeds, as well as spinach, curly cress and other cold-loving greens, in a protected area like a raised bed on the south side of a wall, or in a cold frame? Seeds are cheap, it's fun to push against the outer edges of the season and those first greens of spring are like a tonic.</p>
        <p>Seeds of hardy annuals and vegetables, like broccoli, cabbages, lettuce and asters, can also be sown in a cold frame, if it gets plenty of sun and is out of the wind.</p>
        <p>Keep a vigilant eye on seeds sown indoors. Don't let them dry out, and give them plenty of light (preferably from fluorescent bulbs a few inches from the seedlings) as soon as leaves appear. Transplant to bigger pots after the second set of leaves develop.</p>
        <p>Continue to remove mulch from perennial beds, and finish up any chores left undone last fall, like repairing and sharpening tools, raking up leaves or, zounds!, removing all those dead plants from the vegetable and cutting garden. (Most people never got around to it, but hop to it now, because the planting avalanche will soon arrive.)</p>
        <p>Finish pruning grapevines, raspberry bushes and summer-flowering shrubs.</p>
        <p>And don't forget that there's a hole in the ozone layer and that it's important to wear a hat and use sun screen even in the gentle light of spring.</p>
