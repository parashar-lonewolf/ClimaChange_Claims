        <p>WHILE WE'VE STILL GOT FEET: New Poems. By David Budbill. (Copper Canyon, paper, $15.) Budbill belongs to the tradition in American letters inaugurated by Thoreau and continuing today in manifestations both benign (Wendell Berry) and malignant (Ted Kaczynski), wherein the writer abandons the cacophony of human society for a little paradise in the woods, but instead of quietly living out his days in smog-free solitude insists on coming to town (or writing an essay, or mailing a bomb) every few months to remind us of what a benighted existence we're living. Budbill's Walden, in Vermont, sounds like an enchanting place, with a ''lovely garden / sleeping quietly now under the snow,'' ''an evening grosbeak / perched on the topmost branch of the / fifty-foot-high white pine tree / here on the edge of the dooryard'' and days filled with reverie. Still, it seems presumptuous for Budbill to assume we'd want to crash his hermitage: ''So much silence / is frightening. Better not come here if you / don't want to fall in upon yourself. Better yet, / better not come here at all.'' Such moments are few, though. Budbill's frank self-awareness keeps him from sounding smug for long; he's quick to include himself among the benighted. When Budbill's on his mountain, he longs for the city, and vice versa. Fame, wealth and sex are false gods, he insists, but he hastens to add that he still, at times, craves all three. These are not new ideas -- a list of references in the book shows how strongly he's been influenced by the classical Chinese poets -- but they find fresh expression here, thanks to Budbill's good humor and gusto.</p>

        <p>TANTALUS IN LOVE. By Alan Shapiro. (Houghton Mifflin, $22.) ''All the new thinking is about loss,'' begins Robert Hass's ''Meditation at Lagunitas,'' one of the bellwether poems of our climate. ''In this it resembles all the old thinking.'' Isn't it pretty to think so? Poetry of loss these days, however painful or redemptive, seems to take cold comfort in shutting out complexity, and the possibility there's something new under the sun. Shapiro is an eloquent example. In ''Tantalus in Love,'' he thinks incessantly of loss. A marriage fails, loved ones die, the clock steams pitilessly along; meanwhile, the quatrains run on time. Those who've encountered the author's seven previous collections will recognize the territory. Shapiro handles these universal subjects with acuity; he cuts his eyes at discreet domestic details and they cut back. The husband's lacerated rhapsodizing over his distant wife's foot-of-the-bed yoga practice, in the poem ''Anger,'' is to die for; you can't decide whom to like less, and that's what keeps the poem interesting. Such tightly framed tales of domesticity offer a sense of control parallel to Shapiro's formal facility, reducing and clarifying the poem's field of action in defense against an abysmal multiplicity of things. Who wouldn't, these days, want to imagine that the bedroom, even the unhappy one, is the true arena of our lives? Such strategic exclusions can go too far. ''Didn't someone say somewhere,'' he asks at the end of ''Anger,'' ''if you shot an arrow it would never / reach its target, since the distance could / be halved, and halved, and halved, ad infinitum?'' Yes, someone did: Zeno, as it happens. We all know this, Shapiro included; why pretend otherwise? An austerity program of the sensibilities is one thing; playing dumb amid classical philosophical references is quite another.</p>

        <p>THE LAST TIME I SAW AMELIA EARHART: Poems. By Gabrielle Calvocoressi. (Persea, paper, $13.95.) Calvocoressi brings keen and sympathetic attention to the local disasters the larger world has often overlooked, from a 1944 circus fire to a small town poisoned by its factory to even less visible dramas of personal longing and loss. The political edge in a poem like ''The Death of Towns,'' which describes an industrial town of ''huddled and wheezing'' workers and a river so poisoned the fish ''wore their organs / on the outside,'' recalls the work of Muriel Rukeyser, but Eavan Boland is a more pervasive influence here; like her, Calvocoressi is more interested in archetypal history than in documentary particulars. In the book's long title poem, a succession of speakers project their own yearnings onto Earhart, gradually turning her into a metaphor for the American dream of escape. When a high school teacher who took her class to see Earhart fly says of one student, ''Camille's father lost an arm / to the canning factory. / She left us to take his place,'' the antecedent for ''she'' remains ambiguous. Just as the daughter left school for the cannery, Earhart left earth to provide us all with a dream of transcendence. Calvocoressi's ability to shape and control complex long poems is remarkable, but at times she keeps her subjects at arm's length. ''From the Adult Drive-In'' is the best of the four long poems that make up the bulk of this collection, largely because its narrator, an adolescent who watches the forbidden films from her hiding place in ''the darkening pines,'' doesn't just observe but implicates herself: ''What was it they wanted that I wanted too?''</p>

        <p>LETTERED CREATURES: Light Verse. By Brad Leithauser. Illustrated by Mark Leithauser. (Godine, $19.95.) A chaotic world made manageable (and memorable) via ordering of parts is the ''New Formalist'' dream; it has no more formidable dreamer than Brad Leithauser. MacArthur grantee and author of carefully wrought poems including a verse novel, Leithauser has made a book ideally suited to his talents. ''Lettered Creatures'' is both abecedary and bestiary, from ''Anteater'' to ''Zedonk'' (my dictionary offers the felicitous alternative ''zonkey''). It's packed with charming rhymes (''reader'' / ''Bottom Feeder,'' ''joey'' / ''vertigo-y'') and gallivanting lexicon, justified in ''Octopi'': ''Only the outsize net / Of an odd, overwrought vocabulary / Offers the slightest possibility / Of capturing our inky souls.'' Moments later he drops the word ''obnubilating''; one can be certain he means it. The book is illustrated by his brother, Mark, whose work is said to resemble Audubon's and Tenniel's. Maybe so; it has an affinity also to the animations in Tim Burton's movies, the sort of menacing comic melancholy that really spruces up a camel. This strikes the right tone for reputedly ''light verse,'' pushing the book into the category kids' stuff for adults. In that, the Leithausers' rhyme syndicate is the complement of Tenniel and his collaborator Lewis Carroll, whose Alice put adult stuff on offer for kids.</p>

        <p>PYX. By Corinne Lee. (Penguin, paper, $18.) A pyx is a box used to store the bread-become-flesh of the Eucharist. Lee's book functions similarly, as a container for the daily bread of life experiences -- marriage and motherhood, in particular -- transubstantiated into poetry. The means of transformation are naturally not divine, but lingual. Packed with extravagant sounds and elaborate vocabularies, ''Pyx'' is a great joy to read aloud. Picking lines almost at random I find ''fall's leaf smoke slips in, / a vellum gravy / on our tongues,'' children returning from play ''shellacked with muck'' and ''sacristies hold caches / of crutches flung aside / like chopsticks.'' Such surfeits of sound can sometimes feel as campy as kazoo music, and Lee's determination to never, ever select the expected word can lead to awkwardness and obscurity. There's no reason to say ''the vox populi queried,'' when ''the people asked'' would do, and the book is rife with lines that probably hold fairly straightforward significance but are too heavily cloaked in metaphor to be understood. ''Slurry'' begins, ''I'll not be covert / and, thus, your capital. Take your pill: Today / is my cedar / disposition,'' which I might be able to make sense of, were I not in such a tamarack mood myself. More often than not, though, Lee is able to focus and control her considerable gifts, and the results can be glorious, as when she describes a baby as ''a fontanel, / cooing and crested / with auburn down, filling / my breasts' cleft. Day-old colostrum / like nougat / on her slightly older chin. Both pinnacle and vortex, / she is. Will always be.''</p>
        <p>J.B.</p>
        <p>LEDGER. By Susan Wheeler. (University of Iowa, paper, $14.) Wheeler's poetry doesn't shy from difficulty, complexity or confusion. Her lyrical mode is often one of delight: ''Tyvek Bruce Willis Buffalo Bertelsman,'' she offers in her new book, and ''Nike Iowa Snapple Foucault.'' Nonsense syllables with juicy mouthfeel, or life in the forest of brand names and word games? Either way, Wheeler holds a door open for the jumble of history: Dutch painting and British theology room with old riddles and New York Times articles. If ''Ledger'' brings an order to the world's welter, it's that it speaks often of debt and admits often of guilt. Economics and emotion face each other across a charged field; stuff gathers in the middle, glittery as a sack of diamonds. The risk is that it's just data, Frank O'Hara's ''I do this, I do that'' poem with the ''I'' sidelined, and seeing in place of doing. It would still then be a book of our times, fascinated as these poems are by, in one critic's words, ''mobility, elusiveness, disembodiment, pure visibility and confinement to the world of signs.'' That sounds abstract; at the drop of a hat, Wheeler gets down to brass tacks. Or gold tacks, perhaps. The knockout final poem, ''The Debtor in the Convex Mirror'' (the title nodding to John Ashbery), tracks that trivial thing abounding with metaphysical subtleties and theological niceties, the gold coin. This ''fragment of the debt'' leads us from 16th-century Antwerp to today, ending in Brooklyn with the question of what we owe each other left aching and unresolved -- much less the question of how we'll pay, when saddled with ''Zero / and then sum.''</p>

        <p>CRUSH. By Richard Siken. (Yale University, cloth, $26; paper, $14.95.) Siken's title is meant to suggest both that fizzy eighth-grade feeling and the anaconda that tightens in our guts when love fails, but above all the choice between rock and hard place all lovers must make: pursue and risk rejection, or withdraw and risk loneliness. Siken's solution to this quandary is implicit in the title of the book's first poem, ''Scheherazade.'' If he can keep the narrative of his amorous obsession in constant motion, he can defer romantic failure forever. Of course, he'll reach no happy ending. But Siken's not much interested in endings or beginnings; his territory is the passionate apex of an affair, where ripeness first tips toward rot. As Siken teeters on that summit, hysteria creeps into his lines, especially in the virtuosic ''Saying Your Names,'' where the poet struggles to hold on to his lover (referred to in other poems as Henry) by enmeshing him in a web of alternative names: ''Your name like two X's like punched-in eyes, / like a drunk cartoon passed out in the gutter, / your name with two X's to mark the spots, / to hold the place, to keep the treasure from / becoming ever lost.'' An entire book at this pace would become exhausting, but Siken deftly balances such headlong passages with more stately, deliberate lines: ''Every morning the same big / and little words all spelling out desire, all spelling out / You will be alone always and then you will die.'' Best of all are the poems where Siken's passion and eloquence collide and fuse: ''This is where the evening / splits in half, Henry, love or death. Grab an end, pull hard, / and make a wish.''</p>

        <p>THIS CONNECTION OF EVERYONE WITH LUNGS: Poems. By Juliana Spahr. (University of California, cloth, $45; paper, $16.95.) Both of the extended pieces that constitute Spahr's new book -- ''Poem Written After September 11, 2001'' and ''Poem Written From November 30, 2002, to March 27, 2003'' -- start with the cellular, the intimate, and reach after the whole shebang. It's political poetry the way it's love poetry; how can it not be, when you go for the everything? The longer, latter portion tracks the approach to the war in Iraq, in fact and in public speech, via some data fountain like Google News. But this means we're soaking in it: cloned sheep, global warming, Ben and J.Lo (Those were the days!). It's a poetics of superinformation: a world where everything is connected, not only by virtue of the Rube Goldberg machine called history, but by the insistent flatness of data, the screen where all that appears, appears equivalent. Spahr is a desolate tenant of this information. She dwells inside the tightening web of connection that links her pointedly plural ''beloveds'' and ''yous'' in their lush corner of Hawaii, to the unceasing cataract of facts, the nausea and euphoria of the new sublime: ''In bed, when I stroke the down on yours cheeks, I stroke also the carrier battle group ships, the guided missile cruisers.'' It's not a comfortable or even manageable condition. The hard-won verdict that ends the book, ''all of us / with all of that,'' is ambivalent, emotionally difficult, as it must be. The book seems, finally, like poetry from the 21st century, poised between trying to vault from the flatness of this new world and trying to inhabit it fully.</p>

        <p>THE ECLIPSES: Poems. By David Woo. (BOA Editions, paper, $14.95.) Woo's subject is the challenges of caring for his aging parents, and of doing so with a potent combination of deep compassion and cleareyed scrutiny. One poem, ''My Mother's Hands,'' begins, ''Now that she's ashamed of their ancient burls and gibbous knobs -- / 'Don't be ashamed!' I cry -- / I find myself staring at the raw matter of their decay, / nails crumbling to the opalescent grit / of their lunulae, liver spots speckling the dorsal vein / with its throbbing blue limbs, as if the leopard, / symbol of lust in Dante, lay panting, enfeebled, / in the dark wood.'' The honesty here is remarkable: Woo is obviously sympathetic, but he makes no effort to conceal his fascination with his mother's decline. This graceful book succeeds least when the poems are too well behaved; it's disappointing to see a leaf described as ''enflamed with autumn'' or a bobcat ''the size of my neighbor's small collie,'' when we know the poet is capable of fresher ideas. The strongest poems are marked by stern elegance and the faintest strain of anxiety. Where other writers might rage against the dying of the light, he offers subtle internal rhyme and delicate metaphor: ''Today the patches of sunlit mist that flow in / through the foothills and obscure the filigree / on a row of Queen Annes are occlusions / from my mother's CT-scan: that steel-blue blur / on blur of cortex and wine-dark hemorrhage.''</p>
