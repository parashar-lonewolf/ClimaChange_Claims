        <p>New York State regulators voted yesterday to adopt Gov. George E. Pataki's renewable-energy standards, which require the state to get about a quarter of its electricity from environmentally friendly sources by 2013.</p>
        <p>The vote by the Public Service Commission is a step forward for a plan that will reduce air pollution in the state by about 6 percent while helping to make the renewable-energy industry more competitive, regulators and environmentalists said.</p>
        <p>In his 2003 State of the State address, Governor Pataki announced that he wanted New York to get 25 percent of its energy from renewable sources by 2013. The commission lowered that bar to 24 percent, arguing that retail marketers of ''green energy'' that sell directly to residential consumers should count for the additional percentage point.</p>
        <p>''By investing in renewable energy, we are helping to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, create new jobs and industries here at home and clean up our environment for the benefit of future generations,'' Mr. Pataki said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Among the types of renewal energy the commission decided to include are wind, solar and biomass, which is energy produced by harvesting the heat from rotting organic material. It exempted trash incineration and power produced by large hydroelectric plants. The program is expected to cost $582 million to $762 million over the next nine years, a cost that will be passed on to consumers starting in late 2005. But the cost will be offset by a drop in electricity prices, the commission said.</p>
        <p>The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority is to administer the plan, providing subsidized contracts to renewable-energy companies, which in turn will sell the energy to state utilities that deliver it to consumers.</p>
        <p>Though applauding the announcement, environmental groups also criticized the commission's decision to slightly lower Mr. Pataki's original goal. ''Green marketing programs are voluntary, so they should not have been factored in,'' said Katherine Kennedy, a senior lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council. ''This last-minute reduction was a real missed opportunity.''</p>
        <p>Environmentalists also questioned whether the program had enough oversight. ''This plan ends up being just a directive from one state agency to another state agency, and there is no clear indication of penalties for failing to meet the established goals,'' said Anne Reynolds, a project director for Environmental Advocates of New York.</p>
        <p>New York will need to add 3,700 megawatts of renewable energy to the state's electricity grid to reach the 2013 target. The state now gets about 19 percent of its electricity from renewable sources, mostly from a hydropower plant at Niagara Falls.</p>
