        <p>The United States and other aid-giving countries pledged today to provide $2 billion over the next three years to help poor countries keep the environmental promises they made in Rio de Janeiro two years ago, when they undertook to fight global warming and preserve animal and plant life.</p>

        <p>The United States and other aid-giving countries pledged today to provide $2 billion over the next three years to help poor countries keep the environmental promises they made in Rio de Janeiro two years ago, when they undertook to fight global warming and preserve animal and plant life.</p>
        <p>The money will replenish a new Global Environment Facility, which was set up in 1991 and administered by the United Nations Development Program, the United Nations Environment Program and the World Bank. The fund aims at helping the third world pay the additional cost of keeping development environmentally sound.</p>
        <p>At the Rio meeting, rich and poor countries undertook to give the fund responsibility to help developing countries finance projects related to two environmental conventions and an end to water pollution. The conventions commit governments to curb global warming and preserve the natural diversity of life. The Biodiversity Convention came into force in last December; the Convention on Climate Change is expected to become effective this spring.</p>
        <p>In the agreement reached today, representatives of more than 80 industrial and developing countries decided to share control of the fund. Council decisions will require the support of at least 60 percent of the 32 members of the fund's council. This majority must also have contributed 60 percent of the financing for the fund.</p>
        <p>The $2 billion pledged is more than twice the $800 million that the fund received from donors for its initial three-year program. The United States has agreed to contribute directly for the first time, pledging $430 million. The second largest contributor is Japan, with $400 million.</p>
        <p>The fund has been heavily criticized by rich and poor governments alike and by environmentalist groups. Donor nations wanted a weighted voting system that left them in control; developing nations preferred the United Nations model, where each country has one vote.</p>
        <p>Private environmentalists have accused the fund of promoting harmful projects that the World Bank favors. They also say it is overly secretive about its decision-making and has failed to involve those affected.</p>
        <p>While today's reforms share responsibility for policy decisions, they leave day-to-day management firmly in the hands of its secretariat, staffed by officials drawn from the World Bank and United Nations agencies.</p>
        <p>But any four council members can stop a project by referring it back to the council.</p>
