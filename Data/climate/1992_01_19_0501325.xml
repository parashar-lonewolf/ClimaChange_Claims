        <p>AS a filling for sandwiches, tuna long ago gained a hallowed spot among the nation's favorite lunchtime staples.</p>
        <p>But as the focus of a dispute between the United States and 30 other nations, the simple tuna sandwich is proving to be a far more complex emblem of an enormously risky change in the world's commerce, the linking of ecological concerns to international trade.</p>
        <p>Earlier this month, efforts by American environmentalists to protect natural resources through trade restrictions were advanced considerably when a Federal District judge in San Francisco ruled that the Government must ban more than half the imports of yellowfin tuna to protect dolphins. Business leaders, though, called the decision a dangerous precedent that could prompt Mexico and the 29 other nations affected to counter with restrictions on American exports, or increase tensions in efforts by Mexico and the Bush Administration to reach a free trade agreement.</p>
        <p>At a time when exports of American products are, arguably, the strongest sector of the United States economy, business leaders are concerned about either potential outcome. The Commerce Department reported last week that exports in November totaled $37.5 billion, a record, and the monthly trade deficit was $3.57 billion, the lowest in nine years.</p>
        <p>"The dolphin issue has really brought things to a boil," said Abraham Katz, president of the United States Council for International Business, an affiliate of the International Chamber of Commerce that is based in New York. "American environmentalists are not only attacking Mexico, but the whole system of world trade to support their concept of sustainable economic development. It could easily prompt a backlash." Trade vs. Commerce</p>
        <p>Before the fight over tuna, the world had used separate forums in its attempts to solve environmental and trade disputes. Businessmen turned to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, a 44-year-old treaty administered by an international agency in Geneva that has served to regulate world trade. Environmentalists established a tradition of acting on ecological problems with national laws and international treaties. The dispute over tuna illustrates what can happen when trade rules under GATT collide with ecological protections.</p>
        <p>Because dolphins swim over schools of yellowfin tuna in the Pacific, thousands drown yearly in fishermen's nets. The Marine Mammal Protection Act was passed by Congress in 1972 to limit the slaughter in the American fleet to 20,500 dolphins a year and in 1988 a new amendment directed the Department of Commerce to ban imports of tuna from foreign fleets, including from Mexico, that had higher levels of dolphin kills.</p>
        <p>In 1990, when the Department of Commerce finally barred imports from Mexico and four other countries, Mexico filed its own complaint with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. In October, a three-member GATT panel decided in Mexico's favor because, it said, dolphins were killed in foreign and international waters and the United States had no authority to extend its environmental laws to a sovereign nation.</p>
        <p>On Jan. 9, Thelton E. Henderson, chief judge of the Federal District Court in San Francisco, ignored the GATT panel ruling and raised the prospect of greater tension when he decided that the Government must bar roughly half of the 266,000 metric tons of tuna imported in the United States. Judge Henderson determined that Mexico, Venezuela and Vanuatu, a group of islands in the southwest Pacific, were shipping outlawed tuna to the United States through 27 other countries in violation of United States law.</p>
        <p>Such clashes are certain to increase as conservation groups become more aggressive and declining economic conditions in many regions of the world compel nations to step up their use of natural resources. In fact, economic desperation is beginning to erode some of the historic international environmental agreements.</p>
        <p>Last month, Iceland announced it was withdrawing from the International Whaling Commission in June, a move clearly intended to enable Iceland's fishermen to resume commercial whaling. South Africa and several other southern African nations are pressing to change provisions in the 1973 treaty to protect endangered species in order to begin killing the region's last African elephants for ivory.</p>
        <p>Alarmed that more nations may be prepared to roll back hard-fought gains on the environment, conservation groups now are looking to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade as a means for reducing ecological damage by rewriting its provisions. The United States and other governments agree that the GATT needs to examine the relationship between trade and environmental protection. But they also insist that the issue be excluded from negotiations on international trade, currently at a difficult stage.</p>
        <p>Both sides are clearly aware that the idea of joining ecological ideals with trade is fraught with hazards. Economists have found that rising prosperity tends to reduce pollution by providing the means for paying for controls. Others worry that the cost of complying with the environmental standards of industrialized countries could lead to greater impoverishment and pollution in underdeveloped nations like Mexico.</p>
        <p>"The one way out of this dilemma between free trade and the environment is to set uniformly high standards," said Hilary French, a senior researcher at the Worldwatch Institute, an environmental group in Washington.</p>
        <p>The 12 nations of the European Community are considering levying a tax on carbon dioxide and other byproducts of burning coal and oil to control gases believed by some scientists to cause global warming. But such a measure could make some European industries uncompetitive unless other nations followed. "In the world of trade, we're no longer the biggest player," said Mr. Katz of the United States Council for International Business. "It goes both ways now. Any of the environmental goals we press on other countries, there are some out there that can do the same thing to us."</p>
