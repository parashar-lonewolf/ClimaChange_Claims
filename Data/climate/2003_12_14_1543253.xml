        <p>The Environmental Protection Agency is expected to introduce a proposal this week that would regulate mercury emissions from power plants. The proposal, similar to market-based programs that helped reduce acid rain, would allow coal-burning power companies to buy and sell the rights to mercury emissions. Environmental groups argue that market-based trading works well for pollutants that disperse easily, like sulfur dioxide, which contributes to acid rain, and nitrogen oxides, which contribute to smog. But hazardous toxics like mercury tend to concentrate near the power plants that emit it.</p>
