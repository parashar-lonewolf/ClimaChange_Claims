        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Playing down ''the dismal performance'' of American 12th graders on the Third International Mathematics and Science Study, Howard Gardner (Op-Ed, March 2) protests that such tests ''do not show whether a student can think seriously about a scientific issue.''

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Playing down ''the dismal performance'' of American 12th graders on the Third International Mathematics and Science Study, Howard Gardner (Op-Ed, March 2) protests that such tests ''do not show whether a student can think seriously about a scientific issue.'' Yet he never says how they might be able to do so without the basic skills. Perhaps that is why what he suggests are important scientific questions -- cloning research, financing for studies of global warming and a national health care plan -- are ethical and political questions.</p>
        <p>At least he does not suggest that letting children ''wander'' in high school ''preserves some energy for later when it is better spent,'' as Prof. Dudley Herschbach of Harvard does (front page, March 2). But for many young Americans there is no ''later.'' Since 1976, workers with wages in the 50th percentile have lost about 15 percent of earning power, while the lowest tenth has lost 25 percent in real wages. Students turned out underprepared for the workplace are likely to see their wages decline further.</p>
