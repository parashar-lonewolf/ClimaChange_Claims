        <p>THE bad news, say Alan S. Manne of Stanford University and Richard G. Richels of the Electric Power Research Institute, is that it would probably cost Americans trillions of dollars to reduce their output of ''greenhouse effect'' carbon dioxide gas by as little as 20 percent. The really bad news, the two economists say in a new, unpublished paper, is that a 20 percent cut would almost certainly be offset by increased emissions from poor countries.</p>
        <p>The Manne-Richels estimates are, of course, no better than the computer simulation that generates them. And many environmentalists contend that the simulation assumes away the possibility of rapid technological change under pressure - of finding ways to decouple economic growth from increased use of carbon fuels.</p>
        <p>But it is hard to be optimistic about the prospects for ''clean'' growth in the third world, most notably in China. If the two economists are even close to right, the costs of a successful global effort to control atmospheric warming would be daunting.</p>
        <p>Europe, America and what used to be called the Soviet bloc generate 71 percent of the world's carbon dioxide. Suppose they agreed to stabilize emissions at current levels, and then gradually reduced them by 20 percent by 2020. That goal, almost everyone acknowledges, could be achieved by conserving energy and switching to less polluting fuels.</p>
        <p>According to the Manne-Richels model, Europe and Japan could manage the task by sacrificing 1 to 2 percent of national income. Hitting the 20 percent target would cost the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe much more - perhaps 4 percent of income - because capital is more expensive and the prospects for technological fixes more problematic. America, with a 3 percent loss of potential income, is in between.</p>
        <p>If it were widely accepted that the only alternative was ecological catastrophe, it might well be possible to build a political consensus for sacrifice. But properly calculated, the cost would be awesome.</p>
        <p>The ''present value'' of the cumulative loss over the next century would be roughly $1 trillion for America alone. And the benefit in the absence of a similar commitment to conservation from the third world, where the rate of growth of energy use is double the world average, would be modest. If, for example, China and other poor countries agreed to limit carbon emissions to just double the current level, total carbon dioxide emissions would increase by 15 percent by 2030.</p>
        <p>Doubling seems a generous allowance; surely, even the penurious passengers on spaceship earth would accept a tougher constraint?</p>
        <p>Do not count on it. According to the model, the doubling constraint would reduce the potential income of coal-rich, capital-poor China by a distressing 10 percent. To limit the level of sacrifice to 3 percent of income, China would have to be allowed a fourfold increase in carbon emissions.</p>
        <p>Put the problem another way. Suppose China was permitted to quadruple emissions while the rest of the third world was limited to just a twofold increase. To reduce the total output of carbon dioxide to 80 percent of the 1990 level, the industrial countries would have to cut emissions to zero.</p>
        <p>Necessity, one is told by environmentalists, is the mother of energy conservation. It is conceivable that the developed countries could manage an aggressive program for constraining carbon emissions, and subsidize a more modest technical fix for poor countries. But the depressing conclusions of the Manne-Richels simulations suggest the need to look hard at alternatives to carbon constraints.</p>
        <p>One possibility would be to focus efforts on containing other greenhouse-effect gases. The class of chemicals known as CFC's are wreaking havoc with the earth's ozone layer, as well as helping to warm the atmosphere. Since the industrialized countries are already committed to phasing out their use, it might make sense to accelerate the process.</p>
        <p>Another potential target is methane, a byproduct of rice cultivation and animal husbandry. No one is suggesting that Asians switch to Wonderbread or that Americans become vegetarians. But it may be possible to limit methane pollution by modifying agricultural techniques.</p>
        <p>Last, but hardly least, it might pay to roll with the greenhouse punch, accepting some increase in atmospheric temperature and mitigating the consequences. That might, for example, include irrigation of regions that lose rainfall, or building dikes around coastal cities threatened by rising ocean levels.</p>
        <p>Rolling with the greenhouse punch would cost a small fortune. But if the Manne-Richels numbers are on the mark, confronting the problem directly would cost a large one.</p>
