        <p>The White House, beginning the arduous task of selling an accord to reduce emissions of climate-altering gases, said today that it would not submit the proposed treaty for Senate ratification until developing countries agree to participate in the global environmental effort.</p>
        <p>But developing countries at the global climate-change conference that just ended in Kyoto, Japan, said they would not act until they see the rich countries succeed in cutting their own emissions. And many members of the Senate are already saying it has no chance of passage. The accord is dependent on Senate approval.</p>
        <p>At the insistence of China and other developing countries, the Kyoto conference imposed no requirements on newly industrialized countries and created only limited mechanisms for their inclusion in global efforts to curb so-called greenhouse gases.</p>
        <p>The developing countries delayed a compromise that would have allowed the United States and other major polluters to buy or trade emission credits from countries whose emissions are within acceptable levels, and therefore avoid making significant cuts in emissions in a compressed time period.</p>
        <p>With Senators denouncing the accord as not tough enough on developing countries, the stage was set for a yearlong political fight with the Clinton Administration, which has embraced the outlines of the deal.</p>
        <p>The developing countries' objections provide Mr. Clinton with additional time to muster his arguments in favor of the treaty and an opportunity to portray himself as a defender of the United States' interests. For the next year -- an election year -- he is in the risk-free position of being able to make a strong pro-environmental political pitch while not having to face a damaging vote in the Senate.</p>
        <p>President Clinton defended the agreement as ''environmentally strong and economically sound,'' even as Administration officials were admitting that its flaws made it unacceptable to the Senate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton is likely to either win credit for tackling a difficult problem or pay a huge political cost for misjudging the public's appetite for sacrifice, even if doled out in small portions over many years.</p>
        <p>The outcome of the debate and the political impact on Mr. Clinton and Vice President Gore are yet to be seen. But it is certain that Congress and the American people will be subjected to millions of dollars worth of lobbying and advertising in the next months by powerful coalitions that support and oppose the proposed treaty. Already, both sides are making sweeping claims about the dangers of global warming and the high cost of proposed solutions. Among the President's most difficult jobs will be to help the public decipher those assertions and bring pressure on Congress to take action on a matter over which there is still wide disagreement.</p>
        <p>''The game is afoot,'' a senior White House aide said today.</p>
        <p>In an appearance at a Coast Guard station in Miami, the President acknowledged that he faced the difficult political and diplomatic job of persuading the American people and leaders of developing countries that the threat of global warming is real and requires immediate action.</p>
        <p>''There's still a lot of challenges ahead,'' Mr. Clinton said.</p>
        <p>Even if the countries that agreed to the targets set in Kyoto begin taking steps to reduce so-called greenhouse gases that mainstream scientists believe are warming the earth's atmosphere, concentrations of these emissions will continue to rise for many years. Mr. Clinton and others say that a potential catastrophe in the next century will be averted only by concerted global action beginning now to cut emissions.</p>
        <p>Officials in Washington said the Administration would not put the treaty before the Senate before 1999 at the earliest, after a meeting in Buenos Aires late next year aimed at persuading developing countries to accept the Kyoto agreement's limitations on emissions of greenhouse gases. That timetable would also postpone some of the ratification debate beyond the 1998 Congressional midterm elections. President Clinton has until March 1999 to decide whether to sign the proposed agreement.</p>
        <p>''As we have said from the very beginning, we will not submit this for ratification until there's meaningful participation by key developing nations,'' Vice President Gore said at a Washington news conference today. Administration officials did not define ''meaningful participation,'' saying that it was a matter for months of bilateral and multilateral discussions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore added that the Administration had ruled out tax increases to meet the obligations of the treaty. And he said that the Administration would soon propose a $5 billion package of tax incentives and research grants to move the country onto a more energy-efficient path.</p>
        <p>One senior White House official, who insisted on anonymity, said it was possible that the treaty would not be ready for submission to the Senate during the remainder of Mr. Clinton's term in office.</p>
        <p>Despite the Administration's go-slow approach, domestic opponents of the accord continued to rail against its terms, saying that it meant colder homes, a shrinking economy and higher gasoline prices.</p>
        <p>The House Speaker, Newt Gingrich, said the United States ''surrendered'' to pressure in Kyoto and called the proposed treaty ''an outrage.'' He said the accord would cripple the American economy.</p>
        <p>''Early reports from those in attendance indicate that on 10 critical issues such as cuts in emissions, future developing country commitments and new U.S. commitments, we sacrificed the future well-being of the country based on environmental correctness and inconclusive science,'' Mr. Gingrich said. ''It is profoundly wrong that approximately 134 countries were allowed to vote on a treaty by which they will not be bound.''</p>
        <p>''Mr. President,'' the Speaker asked, ''is this putting America's interests first?''</p>
        <p>Senator James M. Inhofe, Republican of oil-rich Oklahoma, called the Kyoto accord ''a political, economic and national security fiasco'' that will never be ratified by the Senate in any form.</p>
        <p>Mr. Inhofe, in a news release, said that the failure to secure binding commitments from developing countries meant that the agreement fell far short of the standard set in a 95-to-0 Senate vote earlier this year. Among its flaws, he said, was the lack of an exemption for military vehicles and operations.</p>
        <p>''They went to Kyoto determined to get a treaty for its own sake, regardless of the content,'' Mr. Inhofe said. ''What they have come back with is scientifically dubious, economically disastrous and militarily stupid. Yet I don't doubt their determination to try to make it all politically saleable.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, that is the challenge facing the President and the Vice President as the debate over global warming moves into a new phase that will likely keep the issue before the public well into the 2000 Presidential campaign.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton insisted that the United States can make a start toward reducing its emissions without disrupting the economy or reducing the country's standard of living.</p>
        <p>''I see already the papers are full of people saying, 'The sky is falling, the sky is falling, it's a terrible thing,' '' Mr. Clinton said. ''Every time we've tried to improve the American environment in the last 25 or 30 years, somebody has predicted that it would wreck the economy. And the air is cleaner, the water is cleaner, the food supply is safer, there are fewer toxic waste dumps. And the last time I checked, we had the lowest unemployment rate in 24 years.</p>
        <p>''So don't believe the skeptics'' Mr. Clinton said. ''Give us a chance to make the case.''</p>
        <p>Congressional committees are preparing now for hearings next year on the Kyoto accord and the broader question of the severity of the peril of global warming and how to address it.</p>
        <p>Senator Richard Lugar, Republican of Indiana, the chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, said United States negotiators failed in Kyoto to achieve any of their major objectives and came home with a document that makes unacceptable demands on the domestic economy for questionable benefits.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lugar compared the climate negotiations with Mr. Clinton's defeat on ''fast-track'' trade negotiating authority, which the House last month rejected because a majority of Democrats did not believe the President's promises to insure environmental and labor protections in future trade agreements.</p>
        <p>''The President needs to spend some time explaining to the American people the validity of his arguments on global warming,'' Mr. Lugar said. ''He didn't make the case on fast track and he hasn't even begun to make the case on climate change. And now he has to explain how the U.S. negotiators botched it in Kyoto.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, whose presidential ambitions will hinge in part on how the public perceives his role in the global warming debate, appeared mindful of the political risks of the coming months and made an effort to move the issue out of the partisan arena.</p>
        <p>In a White House news conference, the Vice President said: ''In the coming days and months, it will be critical that we avoid looking at this effort through a narrow political lens. Too much is at stake. We must focus instead on the longer-term future of our planet and our economy, and on the health and well-being of our families and communities.</p>
        <p>''This is not a Democratic or a Republican problem, nor is it a problem for any one nation alone,'' Mr. Gore continued. ''It is a problem for the entire world. The stakes are simply too high, environmentally, economically and morally, for us to allow the special interests to get in the way of the common interests of all mankind.''</p>
