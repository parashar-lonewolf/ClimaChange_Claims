        <p>Leonard Cohen has stopped to smell a rose. He was in the middle of a train of thought, sitting at a table in a piano lounge of a ritzy hotel in midtown Manhattan. But the lure of blood red petals, the possible prick of thorn and the whiff of romance have proven irresistible. He leans forward, bends the stem toward him and breathes. The fragile petals contrast sharply with the chisled age of his face. The strong reds and greens accentuate his iron-gray hair and tailored charcoal suit.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohen is a man made for such poetic moments. Songwriter, icon of 60's folk, sometime novelist and perennial sage, he is in town to talk about his new album, "The Future" (Columbia), his first record since the critically lauded "I'm Your Man" in 1988. He says he enjoys doing interviews, but he says it with a bit more flourish: "I'm very happy to cooperate with the convention of promoting the record."</p>

        <p>Leonard Cohen has stopped to smell a rose. He was in the middle of a train of thought, sitting at a table in a piano lounge of a ritzy hotel in midtown Manhattan. But the lure of blood red petals, the possible prick of thorn and the whiff of romance have proven irresistible. He leans forward, bends the stem toward him and breathes. The fragile petals contrast sharply with the chisled age of his face. The strong reds and greens accentuate his iron-gray hair and tailored charcoal suit.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohen is a man made for such poetic moments. Songwriter, icon of 60's folk, sometime novelist and perennial sage, he is in town to talk about his new album, "The Future" (Columbia), his first record since the critically lauded "I'm Your Man" in 1988. He says he enjoys doing interviews, but he says it with a bit more flourish: "I'm very happy to cooperate with the convention of promoting the record."</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohen speaks like a poet. He culls a phrase like "blacken pages" where lesser mortals might simply say "write"; he has a store of aphorisms at his beck and call. "If I knew where songs came from I would go there more often," he says at one point. He is prone to quoting poetry at will, although the poet he most likes to quote is himself. "Sail on, sail on, oh mighty ship of state/ To the shores of need, past the reefs of greed, through the squalls of hate," he rejoinders on the general topic of America's post-election political climate, borrowing a lyric from his song "Democracy."</p>
        <p>And Mr. Cohen, who is 58 years old, has lived the life of a poet, full of deeds and escapades that qualify for the realm of the extraordinary. Born in Montreal, he played in a country band called the Buckskins Boys when he was a teen-ager. He was already embroiled in the bohemian life by the mid-50's, when he published his first volume of poetry, "Let Us Compare Mythologies." He spent several years living on the Greek island Hydra, and in the mid-60's, he became part of the Greenwich Village folk scene, hanging out with Bob Dylan and Joni Mitchell and releasing dark and voluptuous albums like "The Songs of Leonard Cohen" and "Songs From a Room." His lyrics chronicled affairs with women both mysterious and infamous. "Suzanne" contained the consummate line "You've touched her perfect body with your mind." "Chelsea Hotel No. 2," from the 1974 album "New Skin for the Old Ceremony," was about Janis Joplin.</p>
        <p>He has even more anecdotes up his sleeve. Out of the blue, Mr. Cohen is liable to begin a tale by saying, "You know, I was a close friend of Michael X, who was the leader of the black Muslims in England . . ."</p>
        <p>After New York, Mr. Cohen lived for a year on a 1,500-acre homestead in Franklin, Tenn., rented for $75 a month. "Ah, that was a very pleasant period of my life," he says wistfully. "There was a shack -- a well-equipped shack, but not much more than that -- beside a stream. There were peacocks and peahen. They used to come to my cabin every morning. I'd feed them. I had one of those centennial rifles that Remington put out, I think, in '67." He pauses. "When was this country founded? '76?" He seems somewhat dismayed that mathematics could interfere with a colorful detail of his story. "Anyway, I had some kind of centennial rifle. I would amuse myself by shooting icicles on the far side of this creek."</p>
        <p>In the mid-70's, a volatile partnership with the legendary producer Phil Spector resulted in the album "Death of a Ladies Man." Since the 80's, Mr. Cohen has matured into a hero of the disaffected musical intelligentsia. Last year, younger fringe artistes like Nick Cave, Lloyd Cole and Ian McCulloch contributed to a Leonard Cohen tribute album, "I'm Your Fan," released by Atlantic. Like a handful of his peers -- Tom Waits, Marianne Faithfull -- Mr. Cohen is revered to a level that renders his modest commercial success irrelevent. He is a singular entity: a kind of rock-and-roll Lord Byron, a cultural scholar in the unlikely medium of pop.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohen has been working consistently on "The Future" since the release of "I'm Your Man." "Some people write good songs in the back of taxicabs," he remarks. "I wish I were in that tribe." Throughout the album, the time he spent is evident. Never has Mr. Cohen's low, groaning voice sounded quite so world-weary and edged with disgust. Never has his outlook seemed quite so grim. The song "The Future" pledges that whatever lies ahead is unquestionably uglier than the dismal state of things today; "Democracy" is an iconoclast's lament on contemporary politics.</p>
        <p>These songs, Mr. Cohen says, were "occasioned by the collapse of the Berlin wall, which all my friends rejoiced about. I was the only dour person at the party, saying, 'This isn't that good news. This is going to produce a great deal of suffering. You're going to</p>
        <p>settle</p>
        <p>for the Berlin wall when you see what's coming next.' " The tension in his voice rises. "You're going to settle for a hole in the ozone layer. You'll settle for crack. You'll settle for social unrest. You'll settle for the L.A. riots. This is kindergarden stuff compared to the homicidal impulse that is developing in every breast!"</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohen stops short, catching himself being carried away on the waves of despair. "Oh, forgive me for going on like that," he sighs. "I have these gloomy visions of things."</p>
        <p>He finds the subject of America's new President somewhat more calming. "I'm a Canadian," he says, "and Canadians are educated to watch America very closely -- just as women are educated to watch men very closely -- because what America does affects us. My song 'Democracy,' which was begun in '88 or '89, was certainly not designed as promotional material for the Democratic Party. I believe my songs last as long as the Volvo, which is about 30 years. So I don't want to identify this song with this Administration, which may last eight years. I've still got 22 years.</p>
        <p>"But of course, as a Canadian, I wish the Administration well," he continues. "I can summon many blessings for the man, and especially for his wife, whom I find immensely attractive."</p>
        <p>As the evening wears on, the lights in the hotel lounge are brought down a notch, and Mr. Cohen's reflection turns inward. "I find that more and more I inhabit the front line of my own life, with missiles and shrapnel flying through the air," he says. "You really don't have the opportunity to develop much of a strategy about things. Certainly not about your career, and not even about your loves or dreams. So there's a certain urgency to the moment, and how to negotiate from one instance to the next."</p>
        <p>A blond woman in a close-fitting gold dress sits down at the piano and begins to sing. "They say that falling in love is wonderful/ It's wonderful, so they say. . . ." Mr. Cohen falls silent, listening. Gently and abstractly, he fingers the rose.</p>
