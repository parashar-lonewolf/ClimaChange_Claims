        <p>A summary of the top stories in Russian newspapers appears Monday through Friday.</p>
        <p>TODAY'S TOP STORIES  A full day of negotiations and niceties between President Vladimir V. Putin and Nursultan A. Nazarbayev, the president of Kazakhstan, took place Saturday at Mr. Putin's summer residence in Sochi, on Russia's Black Sea coast. Rossiskaya Gazeta described the talks as "extremely effective," citing promises to increase cooperation in the energy sphere, to reconcile differences in customs and transport tariffs, and to collaborate in sharing military equipment and expertise. Mr. Putin also announced that Mr. Nazarbayev would be taking over his role as head of the Commonwealth of Independent States, a loose alliance of post-Soviet nations.</p>
        <p>Nezasimaya Gazeta led with the two presidents' agreement to share the work (and profit) of oil extraction in three oil fields on the Caspian shelf, all of which are situated in politically disputed areas between Russia and Kazakhstan. The joint operation will be divided equally between the two nations' energy monopolies.</p>
        <p>Vremya Novostei reminded readers that Mr. Putin has invited Mr. Nazarbayev (along with Hu Jintao of China) to St. Petersburg for the Group of Eight summit in July, demonstrating that the "Chinese and Kazakh leaders should, in Moscow's view, strengthen their positions in the energy dialogue with Western nations." The paper noted that Kazakhstan's vast reserves of oil and gas have made it a "serious competitor" for Russia as an exporter of fossil fuels in world markets. It said that Vice President Dick Cheney, on a recent tour in Kazakhstan, had "aggressively appealed" to Mr. Nazarbayev to participate in transport projects that would be independent of Russia, such as the trans-Caspian pipeline, which would run under the Caspian Sea and then through Azerbaijan to Turkey. Mr. Nazarbayev has "deftly" played his role in the center of this world energy dialogue, the paper wrote.</p>
        <p>Kommersant echoed this sentiment when it led with news that, following these talks, Russia has agreed to pay market price for Kazakh gas, but wrote that Mr. Putin "had said nothing about this" before the meeting and "and said almost nothing about it afterwards."</p>
        <p>OTHER NEWS</p>
        <p>ROSSISKAYA GAZETA  CONFERENCE IN U.S. CONDEMNED: Under the headline "The Usual Cynicism," the official state newspaper reported that a conference held in Washington by the "odious" Jamestown Foundation and "endorsed by the State Department" was devoted to discussing "perspectives for a new Nalchik," a reference to an armed attack in that southern Russian city in 2005. "To put it simply," the paper wrote, "they were discussing in the American capital, and in all seriousness, plans for future acts of terrorism in Russia." Illuminating Russia's current political enmity with Georgia, the paper said that the only man to give a standing ovation after one speech, "unprecedented in its odiousness," was "the representative from the Georgian embassy."</p>
        <p>IZVESTIA  RUSSIA CHAIRS COUNCIL OF EUROPE: Russia has assumed the chairmanship of the Council of Europe, a position it will hold for six months. Russia has named several priorities for its tenure. They include strengthening national mechanisms for protecting human rights; developing education in the human rights sphere; defending the rights of minority groups; and improving tolerance and mutual understanding through greater cooperation in culture, science, education and sport.</p>
        <p>GAZETA  NEW COUNTRY ON MAP OF EUROPE?: A referendum on Sunday among the residents of Montenegro, part of a confederate union with Serbia, seemed to indicate, according to exit polls, that it would become an independent state. The federation with Serbia was created in February 2003, but according to its constitution, the two component republics would decide in 2006 whether they wished to remain united or to separate forever.</p>
        <p>ARMY SERGEANT FINALLY SENTENCED IN HAZING INCIDENT: Dmitri Nagaitsev, a sergeant in the Russian army, was sentenced by a military court to five years in prison, after a hazing incident in which a soldier lost both his legs. Sergeant Nagaitsev had beaten Private Yevgeny Koblov with a belt. After "systematic taunting and beating" the soldier hid in a cellar for over three weeks without food or water, and lost his legs to gangrene and cold. It took more than six months for criminal charges to be brought and, the paper said, "only after the broad publicity" brought to the issue by a similar incident, in which another soldier, Andrei Sychev, lost his legs and genitals.</p>
        <p>NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA  PARLIAMENT MEMBER ATTEMPTS TO CURB PRESIDENT'S POWER: Boris Vinogradov, a member of the lower house of Russia Parliament, has proposed a bill that would define and limit the powers of the Presidential Administration, or "the most powerful political institution in the land," the paper wrote. Mr. Vinogradov, who is a member of the nationalist Motherland party, said that the Presidential Administration had "long ago turned into ... a real political government, and not just the office of the President." The article suggested the bill had no real chance of being passed since "the Kremlin administration is unlikely to help this project go through."</p>
        <p>VREMYA NOVOSTEI  RUSSIAN CHURCH AND VATICAN FIND COMMON LANGUAGE: Following a meeting in the Vatican between Pope Benedict XVI and Metropolitan Kirill, a prominent leader of the Russian Orthodox Church, the paper writes that the Russian Church is ready to smooth over disagreements with Catholics in Russia, for the sake of a "strategic union" with the Vatican. "Even from the careful and evasive formulations with which Right Reverend Kirill described his unprecedented visit to the pontiff's residence," the paper writes, "it was clear that both the Holy See and the Patriarchate think it necessary to initiate moves to increase the authority of Christianity in the Old World and to protect European Christian values."</p>
