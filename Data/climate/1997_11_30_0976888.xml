        <p>Of all the many issues in the talks that begin here Monday on cutting emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases, none carries more considerations of ethics and morality than the question of how big a burden the third-world countries should bear -- and how soon they should take it up.</p>
        <p>No issue is more likely to torpedo the chances of a successful agreement. Yet some experts see cause for hope that an accord between rich and poor might eventually be struck, if not here in Kyoto, then later.</p>
        <p>The poorer nations have long occupied the moral high ground. They insist that since the rich countries got rich largely by burning the coal and oil that produce the heat-trapping carbon dioxide, and since they are still responsible for most emissions today, it is only right that the wealthy be the first to take legally binding steps to reduce them. They point out that third-world countries stand to be hurt worst by whatever climate changes result from the rich countries' emissions, and they argue that they are hard-pressed enough to assure a decent existence for hundreds of millions of their people.</p>
        <p>President Clinton and the United States Senate, which will vote on any agreement, raise their own fairness issue. They insist that because warming of the atmosphere by greenhouse gases is a global concern, all countries must share in the solution. This is particularly so, they argue, since third-world countries' emissions are expected to surpass those of the rich countries in 20 or 30 years.</p>
        <p>The United States insists it will sign no agreement unless all countries take part in a ''meaningful'' way. For the first time since the signing of a global climate treaty at Rio de Janeiro in 1992, legally binding limitations on greenhouse emissions will be under consideration here. The American stance has provoked counterarguments in the vein of a recent statement by Dr. Mark Mwandosya of Tanzania, chairman of the developing-country caucus in the talks.</p>
        <p>''Very many of us are struggling to attain a decent standard of living for our peoples,'' he said, ''and yet we are constantly told that we must share in the effort to reduce emissions so that industrialized countries can continue to enjoy the benefits of their wasteful life style.''</p>
        <p>The issue is more complicated -- and possibly less intractable -- than it might seem on the surface. The arguments conceal factors believed by many, including Dr. Mwandosya, to contain elements of a constructive approach.</p>
        <p>One good sign, the third-world  countries say, is that they have already lessened the rates at which their emissions are increasing. A recent study by the World Resources Institute, a Washington-based research organization, found that many key third-world countries, have cut or eliminated energy subsidies and as a result are emitting less carbon dioxide than they otherwise would have.</p>
        <p>Cutting the subsidies has raised energy costs and thereby discouraged the burning of coal and oil. The pricing changes were undertaken for economic reasons, not environmental ones, the report said, but the effect on carbon emissions was the same.</p>
        <p>''It appears,'' the study reported, ''that developing countries are already doing a great deal to limit emissions -- a fact largely overlooked in the current debate.''</p>
        <p>Encouraging Signs In Third World</p>
        <p>Dr. Mwandosya said in a recent interview that he believed the reported reductions would be evident when third-world countries make their first official emissions inventories, over the next two years, as required by the 1992 Rio treaty. While the treaty does not impose on the poorer countries any targets and timetables for emissions cuts, it does require them in general to rein in emissions.</p>
        <p>The 1992 treaty required industrialized countries, on the other hand, to aim at a specific goal of reducing emissions to 1990 levels by 2000. Most countries, including the United States, will fail to meet this voluntary target. Two and a half years ago, the conference of the parties to the treaty agreed in Berlin that the original goal was inadequate and began the long negotiating process that is to conclude in Kyoto.</p>
        <p>The Berlin agreement specifically exempted third-world countries from having to do more more than what the treaty's general provisions specify. As a result, the poorer countries have resolutely refused to consider any new commitments in eight sessions of talks leading up to Kyoto. But the final round here will involve the full conference of the parties again, and the issue of new commitments for third-world countries could be taken up formally.</p>
        <p>In addition to whatever progress the poorer countries have made in reducing emissions, there is another reason for encouragement, in Dr. Mwandosya's view. He cited the ''natural phenomenon'' by which third-world countries have historically followed the rich nations' lead in economic and technological development. A variety of existing technologies, many experts say, could reduce emissions either by burning fossil fuels more efficiently or by replacing fossil fuels with alternative energy sources like solar or wind power.</p>
        <p>That is why, Dr. Mwandosya said, it was important ''for the developed countries to create a momentum --  we normally follow the momentum.''  This could allow third-world countries to leapfrog the fossil-fuel stage of economic development by adopting more efficient energy technologies and alternatives to fossil fuels -- if the rich countries lead the way in applying them. On the whole, they have so far failed to do this.</p>
        <p>There are some moves afoot to leapfrog fossil fuels. Often they are portrayed as ''win-win'' solutions in which the twin goals of economic development -- the poor nations' priority -- and cleaner energy can be furthered. Vast rural areas in the third world are without electricity, for instance, and providing it without resorting to fossil fuels is one way to serve both needs.</p>
        <p>Hundreds of thousands of households in Africa and Indonesia are in fact being equipped with solar power in projects sponsored by the United Nations Development Program, the Global Environmental Facility and the World Bank. The trick in spreading alternative energy sources is to remove economic barriers to their adoption, said Anders Wijkman, a policy expert with the United Nations Development Program. Among the toughest barriers, he said, are remaining subsidies that keep oil and coal inexpensive and lack of access to financing for people who want to invest in alternatives like solar energy.</p>
        <p>One reason poorer countries are so reluctant to take on specific reduction targets just now, said Dr. Mwandosya, is that they are unsure that they could meet them, given a scarcity of the money and technology necessary to do so, although the 1992 Rio treaty provides for the transfer of both.</p>
        <p>A number of ''joint implementation'' projects have been tried on a pilot basis: a business or government in a rich country finances or provides the technology for a specific emissions reduction project in a third-world country. The idea is that reductions can be made more inexpensively in a poor country than in a rich one. It makes no difference to the atmosphere, since greenhouse gases mix globally. Eventually, if parties to the 1992 treaty so decide, the rich countries would get credit for emissions reductions even though they take place somewhere else.</p>
        <p>Fears That Some Would Reap Advantage</p>
        <p>Full-scale joint implementation for credit could be one element of a Kyoto agreement on the third-world countries' role. But fearing that rich countries would use the plan as an excuse for doing nothing to reduce their own emissions, many poor nations have been skeptical.</p>
        <p>The issue is complicated by the fact that third-world countries are in varying stages of development. They range from the poorest of the poor to countries on the verge of breaking into the predominantly industrialized world, like China, India, South Korea and Mexico, with many degrees and combinations of circumstances in between. And many of the countries, in all stages of development, are much more urgently concerned with growing and festering air and water pollution, locally and regionally, than with the seemingly more remote problem of global climate change.</p>
        <p>American businesses that depend heavily on energy use say that third-world countries, particularly the better-off ones, would reap a competitive advantage in the world economy if they were absolved from mandatory emissions cuts and American businesses were not. Some labor unions fear that that would force companies to shift more operations overseas at the cost of jobs in the United States.</p>
        <p>Industry-backed studies support that view. But a recent study by the World Resources Institute found that even in energy-intensive industries, energy costs are just one factor -- and one too small to make much difference -- among many that are considered when when decisions are made on where to produce goods. Moreover, the study found, rising energy prices in third-world countries are narrowing and perhaps eliminating whatever cost advantage those countries may have. It concluded that ''differentiated commitments for developed and developing countries can work without compromising U.S. economic competitiveness.''</p>
        <p>Wealthy Countries To Lead the Way</p>
        <p>The idea of tailoring reductions targets to individual countries' economic and social profiles, rather than a one-size-fits-all commitment, has gained some currency in the talks. But the third-world countries show no signs of backing off on their insistence that the rich nations show the way by undertaking specific commitments first. They have, in fact, laid on the table the most stringent proposal of all for industrialized countries: a 35-percent emissions reduction by 2020.</p>
        <p>The size and timing of cuts by industrialized nations is at the heart of the Kyoto talks. But ''if we get that first round of commitments in Kyoto, I think we will be able to get the developing countries on board fairly soon after,'' said Dr. Kilaparti Ramakrishna of the Woods Hole Research Center in Woods Hole, Mass., who is an expert on international environmental law and has closely followed the talks. But he said the developing world is unlikely to follow until the rich countries have demonstrated that their cuts are actually being carried out.</p>
        <p>No one expects that the third-world countries should undertake the same reductions commitments as the rich ones initially, but what would satisfy the United States Senate is unclear. Ninety five Senators  signed a resolution last summer saying, among other things, that the United States should not sign any agreement unless it ''mandates new specific scheduled commitments'' by third-world countries to reduce emissions.</p>
        <p>The fact that time is short and the developing-country issue has not been formally dealt with until now may sharply limit what is possible in Kyoto. It may be, as a senior State Department official said recently, that only part of the problem can be solved now, with negotiations continuing beyond Kyoto.</p>
        <p>This article is one of a series that have appeared since Aug. 12 on the science, politics and economics of climate change with the approach of an international meeting in Kyoto, Japan, beginning tomorrow, to discuss limits on greenhouse gases.</p>
