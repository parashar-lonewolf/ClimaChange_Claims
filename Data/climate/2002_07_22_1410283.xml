        <p>Editorial criticizes Congress for failing to act on number of pressing matters, including bills on energy, trade, prescription drugs, election reform, patients' bill of rights, welfare reform and budget; says Democrats in Senate and Republicans in House seem happy to pass conflicting legislation, giving themselves bragging rights without actually doing anything (M)</p>

        <p>People who have been following Congressional debates and votes on big issues like energy, trade and prescription drugs might be excused for presuming that something was passed into law.

        <p>Four months before the election, two Congresses are at work in Washington. One is energetically tackling corporate responsibility and the creation of a new Homeland Security Department.

        <p>People who have been following Congressional debates and votes on big issues like energy, trade and prescription drugs might be excused for presuming that something was passed into law. But on all these issues Congress is stuck -- as it is on election reform, a patients' bill of rights, welfare reform and important budgetary issues.</p>
        <p>Four months before the election, two Congresses are at work in Washington. One is energetically tackling corporate responsibility and the creation of a new Homeland Security Department. The other, immobilized by partisan bickering, seems happier when the Democrats and the Republicans can each pass conflicting legislation, giving them the bragging rights without actually doing anything.</p>
        <p>In some cases, doing nothing might be fine. No bill would be better than the House energy plan, which would open a wilderness area in Alaska to oil drilling and bestow excessive subsidies on the industries that contribute most heavily to global warming. The Senate bill, which offers more generous incentives for renewable fuels and energy efficiency, is also flawed. But with help from President Bush, who so far has been content to criticize the Democrats, there is still time to reach constructive compromises on other issues.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, Congressional negotiators finally approved a supplementary appropriations bill containing emergency spending for the military and domestic security. But a broader budget resolution remains elusive, largely because Republicans insist on linking it to permanent extensions of previously enacted tax cuts. Given the daily disclosures about malfeasance among top corporate executives, the idea of rewarding the richest Americans with more tax breaks is more ludicrous than ever.</p>
        <p>The trade bill is stuck in a conference committee that is seeking to reconcile Senate and House versions. When the bill was stalled in the Senate, Mr. Bush hammered the Democrats for blocking it. He should now use his influence to move it along by overcoming Republican resistance to certain health benefits it gives the unemployed. He should also throw his weight behind election reform, which is stalemated over the issue of mandatory national standards for voter registration and balloting.</p>
        <p>Congress was supposed to renew the six-year-old welfare reform bill, but the Senate has bogged down over debates about how much to provide for day care and other services to meet the tough new work requirements that most lawmakers favor. A bill that softened the punitive work requirements favored by the House and provided adequate financing for day care would be a real step forward for reform.</p>
        <p>Prescription drug benefits, another elusive goal, will be debated this week on the Senate floor, although right now no single proposal seems to have enough support for passage. Meanwhile, the two chambers are still at odds on whether patients should have the right to sue their insurance companies. Mr. Bush favored protecting that right during the presidential campaign but has since retreated. If he wants a bill, and not just a campaign issue, he could make it happen.</p>
