        <p>UN conference on climate change, which drew 6,000 participants to Nairobi, Kenya, from around world over two weeks, ends with delegates failing to establish timetable for cuts on pollution linked to global warming, but agreeing to review Kyoto Protocol by 2008 (S)</p>

        <p>The yearly United Nations conference on climate change, which drew 6,000 participants to Nairobi from around the world over two weeks, ended with delegates failing to establish a timetable for cuts on pollution linked to global warming, but agreeing to review the Kyoto Protocol by 2008. The protocol, which requires cuts in emissions by most industrialized countries, expires in 2012. One persistent problem was a reluctance by the United States, the largest source of air pollution and one of the few countries that has not ratified the treaty, to agree to any mandatory emissions limits. Another problem was an increased resistance from China and India, which are among the fastest-growing polluters but face no penalties under the accord.</p>

        <p>Correction:  November 29, 2006, Wednesday  Because of an editing error, a report in the World Briefing column on Nov. 18 about the United Nations conference on climate change held in Kenya referred incorrectly to an expiration provision in the Kyoto Protocol treaty to control the effects of global warming. Its binding restrictions on greenhouse-gas emissions by most industrialized countries expire in 2012. The treaty itself does not expire.</p>
