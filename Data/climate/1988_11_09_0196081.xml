        <p>LEAD: To the Editor:</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Apropos ''Bush vs. Bush on the Environment'' by John B. Oakes (Op-Ed, Oct. 15), the Fine Arts Federation of New York long ago wrote letters to both Presidential candidates pleading with them to make acid rain and other clean air abuses a fighting issue, but the problem received only tangential mention in the debates.</p>
        <p>As an arts organization, we have regularly pointed out acid rain's savage attack not only on our lakes and forests, but also on our marble statues and on our grandest monuments and historic buildings.</p>
        <p>New York City's Washington Memorial Arch at the foot of Fifth Avenue is a prime example. Its statue of George Washington as President by Alexander Stirling Calder is so severely eroded that the facial features are blurred. Also, the facade of the regal New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue at 42d Street is a virtual chemical laboratory. The marble architecture, with its panoply of statues by Frederick MacMonnies and other renowned sculptors, is bathed with acid substances by every passing shower. This acid rain is carried on eastbound winds from coal-burning industrial plants in the Midwest and is also generated by the intense Fifth Avenue traffic, where every gasoline engine adds to the pollution.</p>
        <p>The Fine Arts Federation believes that the problem of acid rain, along with the whole complicated matter of our fragile atmosphere, should be brought to the front and center of attention. STEPHEN B. GOTTLIEB, MARGOT GAYLE  New York, Oct. 19, 1988  The writers are, respectively, president of the Fine Arts Federation of New York and chairman of its acid rain committee.</p>
