        <p>AS the world approaches the day of decision on a treaty to deal with the threat of global warming, separate negotiations on another overarching environmental question, maintaining biological diversity, are moving toward their own denouement.</p>
        <p>The object of these less prominent but nevertheless high-stakes talks is to forge a binding agreement among the world's nations to slow or halt a steady loss of plant, animal and microbial species that many biologists fear will result in a mass extinction of epic proportions in mere decades.</p>
        <p>The basic question involves actions that nations should be required to take in conserving species, habitats and ecosystems. Despite a patchwork of international agreements like the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, there is no legally binding treaty that directly and comprehensively addresses the overall problem of preserving biological diversity.</p>
        <p>Some countries have developed national action plans to identify, conserve and manage biological resources. But most, including many tropical countries that are richest in species, have not. These are precisely the main countries where economic and development pressures are destroying habitats at a rate that alarms many scientists and conservation biologists.</p>
        <p>Dr. Edward O. Wilson of Harvard University, an expert on the subject, has calculated that 50,000 species a year are being doomed to eventual extinction because of deforestation in the tropics. At that rate, says Dr. Wilson, a quarter or more of all species on earth could be exterminated within 50 years. While a few biologists say that the problem has been overstated, few if any argue with the idea that a problem exists, and most say it is serious. The direst scenarios predict an eventual wave of extinctions comparable to the one 65 million years ago in which the dinosaurs disappeared. Scientists say this could weaken the ecological webs that support human life.</p>
        <p>Like the talks on global warming, whose penultimate session ended last week in New York on a modest note of hope, the talks on preserving biological diversity are throwing a spotlight on basic differences between the rich nations of the industrialized world and the struggling countries of the developing world.</p>
        <p>In both cases, the poverty-plagued countries of the South, as they are collectively characterized, insist that the affluent countries of the North foot the bill for the developing nations' part in dealing with the problem. The two sets of treaty talks are tied together on this question, in that the negotiators on biodiversity are hoping that their counterparts on global warming can come up with a solution that might be emulated.</p>
        <p>Each group of negotiators is charged by the United Nations with producing a legally binding treaty to be signed at an "Earth Summit" in Rio de Janeiro in early June. The final round of climate negotiations is to take place at United Nations headquarters in New York from April 30 through May 8. Three days later, the last round of biodiversity talks convenes in Nairobi, Kenya.</p>
        <p>Both groups of negotiators are hoping that the outlines of a financial solution will emerge this month as yet a third group meets at the United Nations to work out a nonbinding global action agenda, covering a wide range of related environmental and development issues, for the Rio conference. A crucial issue on the agenda is that of North-South financial arrangements. This third group convened yesterday.</p>
        <p>There are other difficult issues in both the climate talks and the talks on biodiversity. Equally critical to prospects for a climate treaty is an agreement between the United States and the European Community on how to limit carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases emitted as a result of human activity. The Europeans insist that carbon dioxide emissions be stabilized at 1990 levels by the year 2000.  The Americans reject the notion of targets and timetables. Many developing countries say they will not sign a treaty unless the industrialized countries make specific commitments on reducing emissions.</p>
        <p>On the central purpose of the biodiversity talks, there is "a high likelihood we can come to an agreement" on national commitments to protect species, habitats and ecosystems, said J. D. Buffington of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, chief American representative in the group of negotiators dealing with the issue.</p>
        <p>"We've established in principle the importance of conservation activities within a country, including setting aside reserves and managing those areas," he said after the latest negotiating session ended in mid-February.  The negotiators have agreed that such programs should be the primary line of defense, with seed banks, gene banks and zoos secondary.</p>
        <p>If an agreement along these lines is achieved, it would for the first time bind governments together in a mutual obligation to conserve species. "It would set up machinery that would assure that biodiversity issues remain on the table, that they're not just a flash in the pan," said Jeffrey A. McNeeley, the chief conservation officer of the World Conservation Union, a global association of private and governmental organizations.</p>
        <p>One remaining obstacle has to do with whether a specific list of species, habitats and ecosystems to be protected should be drawn up to guide the international effort. Conservation organizations favor the list as being essential to the setting of international priorities, but some countries fear it would trespass on their ability to set their own priorities.</p>
        <p>"This could be addressed if the list were established by nominations from countries," said Dr. Walter V. Reid, a conservation expert at the World Resources Institute, an environmental organization based in Washington. "There's plenty of room for negotiation."</p>
        <p>Issues other than the central question of conservation measures are posing greater difficulty. One of these involves the ownership of genetic materials. Historically, seeds, germ plasm and specimens of individual species have been considered to be in the public domain. Anyone who found them could exploit them without compensating the country of origin. Now developing countries are seeking to claim control over these resources and to share in their economic benefits.</p>
        <p>Another thorny question involves the control of genetically altered organisms. Some European countries want them strictly regulated. The United States rejects the notion that such organisms are inherently dangerous, any more than natural organisms are dangerous just because they are natural. Last week the White House announced new ground rules for Federal regulation that would focus on the actual characteristics of an individual organism rather than on the fact that it has been genetically altered. In the talks, the United States argues that the question is peripheral to a treaty whose primary purpose is conservation of natural species.</p>
        <p>Argument also attends the issue of the terms on which the industrialized countries should transfer conservation technology and know-how to developing countries. But the biggest point of contention is the one between North and South over money.</p>
        <p>"We have made a certain amount of progress on everything except funding," said Eleanor Savage, a State Department official who heads the United States delegation at the talks.</p>
        <p>To many developing countries, conservation is clearly secondary to the day-to-day struggle to support their surging populations. "Seeing it from where you are or I am, the environment might look very important," said Fiona McConnell, the head of the British delegation. "But if your concern is survival, you might need some persuading."</p>
        <p>Money is the persuader, and some developing countries are proposing that the North not only bear the costs of putting new conservation measures into effect but also compensate the South for foregoing the economic benefits of cutting down forests to expand commercial agriculture or timbering, for example. But other developing countries believe that if the forests are preserved and properly exploited for medicine and renewable products, they are worth more than if they are cut down.</p>
        <p>The United States opened a possible wedge into the financial issue last week when it reversed position and pledged unilaterally to contribute $75 million to developing countries' costs of coping with global warming.</p>
        <p>Of that sum, $50 million would be paid into the Global Environmental Facility, a pilot program established last year by the World Bank, the United Nations Environment Program and the United Nations Development program to channel environmental money from North to South.  Developing countries welcomed the reversal with reservations. Many fear that the Global Environment Facility, which is controlled by developed countries, will shut them out of a say in administering the funds.</p>
        <p>At this point, many would agree with Ms. McConnell of Britain, who says she is "cautiously optimistic" that a biodiversity treaty can be signed.</p>
        <p>"If the funding article is resolved," said Dr. Reid of the World Resources Institute, "it will fall into place very quickly."</p>
