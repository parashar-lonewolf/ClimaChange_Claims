Transcript of Pres Clinton's address to United Nations environmental conference (M)




John H Cushman Jr analysis contends that Pres Clinton has confronted two most important environmental questions of year: how to slow global warming and how to tighten Clean Air Act; maintains that he satisfied environmentalists in his constituency on issue of smog and soot, but deeply disappointed many of them on question of climate change; photo (M)




Pres Clinton tells special session of United Nations that if countries ignore 'real and imminent' problem of global warming, earth risks severe drought, floods and spread of infectious disease; stops well short of commitment to cutting greenhouse gases that allies have been urging; defers announcing such restrictions until international meeting in Japan, in Dec; photo (M)




International conference on global environment at United Nations ends on gloomy note; while nonstop speeches go on in General Assembly, committees of nations are unable to agree on concrete proposals in three critical areas: cutting emissions to head off global warming, protecting forests and increasing aid to poor nations who are ruining their environments through uncontrolled development; photo of Assembly pres, Razali Ismail (M)




Editorial reviews challenges facing Pres Clinton as he works to develop credible plan for addressing global warming




United States auto makers are lobbying against Clinton Administration move to tighten metropolitan air quality standards and its backing for international limits on carbon dioxide emissions to counter global warming; fear moves will give foreign rivals competitive edge (M)







Clinton Administration predicts steps to combat global warming by limiting emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases might, over next few decades, shave fraction of percent from nation's economic growth, followed by recovery; Council of Economic Advisers head Janet Yellen tells House panel that move could have barely discernible economic effect or net economic benefit if done deftly; panel members are skeptical (M)




US Senate unanimously urges Clinton Administration not to pursue treaty that would limit industrial world's emission's of greenhouse gases unless agreement requires developing countries to control their rapidly growing emissions at same time (M)




Fossil fuel producers, who previously denied link between greenhouse gases and climate change and staunchly opposed binding agreements obligating countries to control their emissions, are now expressing widespread willingness to accept view of mainstream scientists that problem is real and that some action is needed to solve it; industry delegates attending meeting on climate change in Bonn, Germany, are surprised to hear British Petroleum, world's third-largest oil company, admit that concern about burning of fossil fuels is scientifically warranted (M)




Excerpts from Pres Clinton's news conference (L)




The Warming World: Confronting Climate Change, first in series of article that will appear this year on climate change; United Nations-sponsored talks are being held among 145 countries, on legally binding reductions in emissions of waste industrial gases that trap heat in atmosphere, so-called greenhouse gases, that may already be disrupting earth's climate; participants agree that no breakthrough is possible until United States and Japan produce their proposals for specific reductions and timetables; Japan is considered pivotal nation because of its economic strength and because, as host of final session of talks, it will be in special position to influence outcome of talks; US is crucial to talks by virtue of its economic weight, international influence and huge emissions of geenhouse gases (L)




Experts ponder how urgent the problem of climate change is as nations of world count down to Dec 10 deadline for negotiating cuts in emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases, chiefly carbon dioxide; mainstream scientists like Thomas R Karl say signs of climate change due to greenhouse effect are already evident, but some others disagree, saying climate changes are real but natural; even scientists who are convinced that humans are chjanging climate in important ways and that greenhouse warming is a serious issue believe that taking no action now would have little appreciable climatic effect; drawing; map (M)




Growing number of scientists contends that Sun's fickleness might rival human pollution as a factor in climatic change; note that in last decade or so various kinds of solar variations, such as sunspots, flares and seasons of storms, have begun to be tied to climate shifts on Earth; some research suggests that Sun's variability could account for virtually all of global warming measured to date; other experts dismiss possibility of such an influence; drawings; graph (L)







Pres Clinton, who will be host of upcoming climate conference at Georgetown University, invited dozens of television weather forecasters to meet with him and Vice Pres Al Gore at White House on Sept 24 to discuss global warming; photos (M)




Economic Scene column on need for Clinton Administration to develop global warming policy; says Administration is reluctant to agree to any policy with teeth unless developing countries, notably China, India and Russia, join in; drawing (L)




Pres Clinton invites over 100 national and local television forecasters to White House for chat with him and Vice Pres Al Gore and for briefings on climate change from Government experts; Administration hopes that forecasters will influence public opinion on climate change more than journalists on evening news; playing host to nation's television weather forecasters is innovative step in White House campaign to rally public support for new binding global targets for restricting greenhouse gases; broad coalition of industry and labor groups is spending some $13 million on advertising opposing such targets, which may be adopted at international conference in Kyoto, Japan, in Dec; photo (M)




Clinton Administration seeks to broaden support for its global warming pact before its negotiators present specific targets and timetables for greenhouse gas emissions; toward that end, carefully selected greenhouse experts will assemble for daylong conference at Georgetown University (M)




Japanese officials worry that conference on global warming in Kyoto in December 1997 may end up as fiasco because many countries are losing enthusiasm for proposals to cut emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide; conference was intended to be historic convention at which nations would commit themselves to specific cuts in emissions, which mainstream scientists say are linked to global warming (M)




Editorial Notebook comment by Robert B Semple Jr says Pres Clinton can turn increasingly polarized argument about global warming to his advantage by positioning himself as moderate in American proposal he presents to industrialized nations meeting in Kyoto, Japan, in December to negotiate treaty controlling emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases; says in addition to Clinton's stated principles, one element he has not talked about is emissions-trading scheme in which rich nations would 'buy' pollution permits from poorer countries (M)




Latest article in occasional series, The Warming World, explores economics of climate change; now that Pres Clinton has accepted dominant view among scientists that global warming is serious matter, debate has shifted to question of how restricting emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide may affect nation's economy; industries that produce fossil fuels or use lots of them argue that serious economic damage would result if use of fuels is significantly cut; environmentalists and advocates of alternatives to fossil-fuel energy say economy as whole would gain because it would use energy more efficiently; conference on climate change sponsored by White House will focus on cost of environmental change; Pres Clinton is under pressure to come up with specific proposal for reducing emissions, that would be presented at meeting of nations of world in December in Kyoto, Japan (M)




Bill McKibben Op-Ed column on White House conference on global warming; fears Pres Clinton is modifying goals on cutting carbon dioxide in atmosphere, heeding economists over environmentalists (S)




Pres Clinton's senior economic and environmental advisers, to dismay of environmentalists seeking swift action to toughen international treaty on climate change, are urging him to delay until year 2010 and beyond time when US and other industrial nations must achieve deep new reductions in pollution that may cause global warming; Clinton's advisers, assuming that international negotiations produce such a treaty this year to help control climate change, are warning him not to present it for Senate's approval unless developing countries first agree, in separate pact negotiated within next few years, to control their own emission of greenhouse gases (M)




Edgar Herwitch letter, commenting on October 7 article on Pres Clinton's support for scientific evidence linking burning of fossil fuels to climate change, says he should consider imposition of carbon tax (S)




Auto industry is finding new reason to worry about Washington: global warming; industry officials say there is no greater threat to American auto industry than concerted worldwide push to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other so-called greenhouse gases, suspected culprits in long-term global climate change; photo (Special Section, Cars) (M)




Article examines reasons behind US failure to honor commitment to reverse increase in emissions of pollutants that threaten global warming; critics cite Clinton Administration's refusal to impose mandatory measures, like requiring fuel efficiency of automobiles to be increased or forcing people to conserve fuel; failure will be at heart of Administration's problem at upcoming summit in Bonn, Germany, where industrial nations will again negotiate how quickly industrial nations must rein in emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases; charts (M)




US Energy Department report says nation's emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases grew in 1996 at highest rate since it pledged to cut them back; says emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases grew 3.4 percent in 1996; attributes increase to strong economic growth, unusually severe weather and increased use of coal by electric utilities (M)




Prof Alan S Blinder Op-Ed article on difficulty facing Pres Clinton in balancing environmental and economic concerns in setting policy on greenhouse gas emissions to combat global warming; proposes treating effort as form of insurance and cites ways to drastical cut costs; drawing (M)




Editorial contends that most important thing to understand about Pres Clinton's speech on global warming is that he has asked US, hungry producer and consumer of energy, to reverse course; notes that his package is less than what many environmentalists had hoped for and not nearly as aggressive as goals that some foreign countries will put on table when industrialized nations convene in Kyoto, Japan, in Dec to try to negotiate global climate treaty; maintains that cannot obscure fact that for first time, a President has committed US to changing ways it produces and uses energy (M)




William K Stevens analysis contends that after two years of struggle over what to do about global warming, negotiations between Clinton Administration and developing countries have at last begun in earnest; notes that delegates from 150 countries are meeting in Bonn, Germany, to discuss possible revisions to 1992 treaty on climate change; says it is last of eight negotiating sessions leading up to final one in Kyoto, Japan, in Dec (M)




Excerpt from Pres Clinton's remarks to National Geographic Society on global warming (M)




Pres Clinton, in speech to National Geographic Society, outlines moderate program to fight global warming, saying that it will be painless and even economically beneficial but it must be carried out quickly to be effective; says plan would rely on tax credits and research subsidies to encourage conservation of energy in next few years; says it would also give American companies extra credit for moving more quickly than required to cut their emissions of atmospheric pollutants that trap sun's heat and threaten to alter planet's climate; says it would not reduce emissions to 1990 benchmark until some time between 2008 and 2012; photo (M)




Rights to spew carbon dioxide into atmosphere will eventually be traded by energy producers, utilities and even investors on futures exchanges if Pres Clinton's global-warming plan becomes reality; while Clinton Administration's plan for curtailing greenhouse gases demands no immediate action by businesses, it confirms that a system of tradable emissions permits will figure prominently in any long-term effort to control pollutants; such a system would allow companies that voluntarily reduce emissions below certain level to sell difference to others as unused 'rights' to pollute; American Electric Power, which owns coal-burning operation in Rockport, Ind, is working on pilot project with Pacificorp and British Petroleum to spare five million acres of Bolivian forests from logging; forest absorbs carbon dioxide, effectively storing millions of tons of carbon that would otherwise end up in atmosphere; drawings; charts; photos (L)




Jack Kemp Op-Ed article says Pres Clinton should not sign global climate change treaty, even if conditions are met by other large hyrdocarbon producers; says whether humans influence climate change remains unknown, despite assertions to contrary by Clinton Administration; says treaty could stifle US competitiveness; drawing (M)







Experts Doubt Rise of Greenhouse Gas Will Be Curtailed** Climate experts say doubling of heat-trapping carbon dioxide in atmosphere will be difficult if not impossible to avoid since world's economic and political systems cannot depart from business as usual rapidly enough; many say any action emerging from world conference in Kyoto, Japan, in early December will be insufficient to prevent an eventual doublig of greenhouse gases (M)




Article in The Warming World, series on climate change, focuses on computer models that will serve as policy guides for nations as they prepare to meet in Kyoto to negotiate cuts in emissions of greenhouse gases; says scientists can precisely measure increase in heat-trapping greenhouse gases in Earth's atmosphere, but cannot say precisely what climate changes, if any, the increase will produce; says increasing power of computers has enabled climatologists to improve their ability to make numerical models of climate change; charts; diagrams (L)







United States Energy Dept says that emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases from energy use will grow faster than previously expected in United States in next few years; this would make it more difficult for United States to live up to Pres Clinton's proposal to cap emissions of these gases at 1990 levels over next 10 to 15 years (S)




Article in series The Warming World reports growing evidence that most of Holocene period, the last 10,000 years, which has long been thought to be a benign era whose stability was crucial to rise of civilization, has in fact been typified by episodes of warmth, cold, drought and flooding more extreme than anything experienced in 20th century; cites new analysis of ancient ocean sediments by researchers at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, which indicates that centuries-long cold spells have occurred more or less regularly, roughly every 1,400 to 1,500 years during the Holocene; other recent studies suggest that world is in early stages of a natural warming phase and that, if so, any warming due to greenhouse gas emissions, would come on top of natural temperature increase, delivering something of a one-two punch; graph (L)




Timothy E Wirth is named to head new United Nations Foundation, which will allocate $1 billion Ted Turner has promised to contribute to UN over next decade; former Senator will leave as Undersecretary of State for Global Affairs; he comments on plans, interview; UN suggests 10 areas where new foundation could concentrate efforts; names Angela Kane as its representative at fund (M)




Ritt Bjerregaard, European Union's outspoken Environment Commissioner, is complaining about 'weak' United States and Japanese proposals for limiting emissions of gases like carbon dioxide that may contribute to global warming; European Union has called for cuts in so-called greenhouse gases that are far more stringent than those of rest of industrialized world, stand opposed by European business leaders (M)




Under Sec Stuart Eizenstat, new chief negotiator on climate treaty, says criticisms of US position on global warming are 'ill-founded' and warns that upcoming talks in Japan may not be able to bridge differences; photo; notes US disagrees with European Union plan for members to be yonsidered as unit in calculating emission cuts; US will also insist that developing countries agree to binding reductions in emissions over reasonable period of time (S)




Poisoned Lands, first of two articles on growing environmental catastrophe all across Asia; cost of Asia's 'economic miracle' is rising tide of pollution proving burden not just for Asia but for entire earth; many experts say Asia already has dirtiest water in world, filthiest air, most worrisome overfishing, and fastest-disappearing coral reefs; United Nations study suggests that 13 of 15 cities with worst air pollution in world are in Asia; World Health Orgn and World Bank estimate that more than 1.56 million Asians die each year from effects of air pollution alone, while 500,000 more die from dirty water and bad sanitation; Asia's industrialization is taking place at triple pace of industrial revolution in West; delegates from 150 countries who will meet in Kyoto, Japan, for conference on global warming must consider how to accommodate economic rise of Asia; China is already second-biggest source of greenhouse gases linked to global warming, and China and India are two fastest-growing sources of these emissions; photos; map; graph (L)




New York Times Poll finds American people are far more willing than their Government to take early, unilateral steps to counter threat of global warming; they appear to be unimpressed by industry arguments that cutting United States' emissions of heat-trapping gases into atmosphere might cause undue economic harm; 65 percent of those polled say US, which releases more such greenhouse gases than any other country, should take steps now to cut its own emissions 'regardless of what other countries do'; delegates from 166 nations will assemble in Kyoto, Japan, to try to negotiate tougher, binding treaty on controlling emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases; Clinton Administration has proposed binding treaty, but not until another 10 or 15 years have passed; chart (M)




Second of two articles on Poisoned Lands of Asia focuses on the public obliviousness there to the health risks posed by environmental calamities throughout region, like deadly smoke from Indonesia's forest fires; says region's worst problems tend to be in new mega-cities, where children play in rivulets of sewage; discusses difficulty of dealing with transborder pollution, like the Indonesian fires, addressing global problem posed by greenhouse gases and chlorofluorocarbons and preserving resources in the international 'commons,' like oceans; says that there is some progress amid the filth and that at least in the wealthier countries of the region, there hope that the worst is, if not over, at least in sight; photos (L)




Negotiators from more than 150 countries will convene on Dec 1 in Kyoto, Japan, to try to agree on cuts in emissions of heat-trapping industrial waste gases; many experts feel that world's political and economic systems are not capable of responding fast enough to keep carbon dioxide concentrations in atmosphere from rising, late in next century, to twice what they were during Industrial Revolution; United States and other rich countries have greatly insulated themselves from vagaries of climate with reservoirs, dams, pipelines, aqueducts and irrigation systems; many third world populations live with the climate, existing precariously close to edge; photo; chart (M)
















: Until Payoff Is Clear, Haste Means Big Waste***Still-distant risks from global warming have yet to grab attention of Main Street America--difficulty many economists say may yet prove blessing; many feel crash programs to reduce greenhouse gases are apt to increase cost of containing emissions without increasing economic benefits; their immediate concern is difficulty of slowing emissions without support from China, India, Brazil and half-dozen other big emerging economies; feel while Europe, America and Japan are heavy emitters of greenhouses gases, cheaper fixes lie elsewhere; estimate that bribing or bullying developing world to switch to energy-saving, carbon-sparing technologies would get job done for fraction of cost of squeezing comparable emissions out of developing economies; graphs; charts (M)




Glossary of terms that play important role in climate change debate (M)2




Skeptical and suspicious Congress will be watching closely as Clinton Administration negotiates international treaty to curb global warming; coping with climate change is shaping up as another thorny intergenerational issue that forces lawmakers to make painful political choices now that will probably not yield tangible benefits for years or decades; few in Congress have studied issue in depth, but many are staking out stands consistent with those of their labor, business or environmental allies (M)




Representatives of 150 nations are set to meet, Kyoto, Japan, to begin decades-long effort to cope with prospect of global climate change; will seek accord on reducing emissions of carbon dioxide and other waste industrial gases that trap heat in atmosphere; effort to curb use of fossil fuels that create 'greenhouse' gases has set off complex clash of economic and political interests; pits rich countries against poor ones and against one another and producers and heavy users of fossil fuels against rest of world; graph; photos (M)




Internal year-long Clinton Administration struggle to shape global warming plan discussed; has led to resignation of State Dept aide Timothy E Wirth, who is nominally top official directly in charge of Kyoto talks toward new climate treaty; Clinton, listening to warnings from economic advisers, gradually scaled backed Wirth's aggressive plan to cut back greenhouse gas emissions; debate went beyond economics to encompass opposing views on technology's potential and on ways of predicting unpredictable systems; table; photos (M)




Global warming is re-igniting passions commonplace between India and West during cold war, just as both sides were beginning to put past frictions behind them; Indian environmentalists and politicians have joined chorus of angry denunciations of proposal that Western nations, particularly US, have advanced for limiting emissions of greenhouse gases; depict efforts of Western environmentalists as mask for efforts to shackle economic development of poorer nations just as they show signs of beginning to claim greater share of world's wealth; say it is up to US and other Western nations to cut back on emissions without imposing similar requirements on poorer countries struggling to catch up economically with West; photo (M)




Even though Poland has succeeded in reducing air pollution since collapse of Communist rule, it remains criticized by Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development over its dirty air, and upcoming Kyoto, Japan, conference on global warming is expected to add extra pressure; reduction has been achieved, in large part, by investments in desulfurization installations at power plants and gradual phasing out of small emission sources, like coal-burning stoves and boilers; Polish environmental official, Wojtek Ponikiewski, says there is no possibility that country will agree to suggestion by European Union that world's nations commit to 15 percent reduction in greenhouse gases, to 1990 emission levels, by 2010; photo (M)




Brazil, which will be participant at Kyoto, Japan, conference on global warming, says it has made progress against deforestation of Amazon rainforest; says emissions caused by forest fires set by ranchers pales next to environmental damage caused by US industry, which puts out 22 percent of world's fossil fuel emissions; photo (S)

European efforts to cut emissions of greenhouse gases implicated in global warming discussed in light of European pressure on United States in Kyoto, Japan, talks for emissions cuts; Europe, which releases half the volume per person of such gases as United States, has been aided by some one-time factors and will have hard time meeting own ambitious goals as economy grows; graph; photo (M)




Elements of possible agreement on cutting industrialized countries' emissions of heat-trapping waste gases begin to emerge from intensive negotiations in Kyoto, but there is no such movement apparent on immediate role to be played by developing countries in controlling the gases; that poses threat to overall prospects for success in talks or for US acceptance of any agreement that is worked out (M)










Wind power is booming across Europe, encouraged by improved technology, falling costs and Government incentives like tax credits and guaranteed prices; 4,700 windmills in Denmark generate 6 percent of country's electricity; policymakers point to boom as key example of how pollution can be cut without jeopardizing jobs or economic growth (M)




Clinton Administration's options in trying to strike a deal on global warming at talks in Kyoto, Japan, are limited by highly effective lobbying campaigns that have been waged for months by warring interests in US; environmental groups have succeeded in convincing public that threat of climate change caused by greenhouse emissions is a settled scientific reality that requires stronger correctives than Administration has proposed; powerful business interests emphasize economic risks and need to bring developing countries into any binding new treatments, arguments that have strongly influenced the Senate, where any pact must be ratified; photo (M)

Vice Pres Al Gore arrives, Kyoto, Japan, for international conference on global warming and signals that US may make some compromises; tells American delegation to be flexible in negotiations; indicates he remains committed to Clinton Administration's original position on reducing rich countries' emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases by 30 percent, to 1990 levels, between 2008 and 2012 (M)




Pres Clinton telephones leaders of Argentina, Brazil, Philippines and Tanzania to lobby for new treaty to fight global warming (S)













Negotiators from around world agree on package of measures that for first time will legally obligate industrial countries to cut emissions of waste industrial gases that scientists say are warming earth's atmosphere; details of one contentious issue--possible trade or sale of emission permits between countries--remain unsettled; US says it wants this issue resolved before it signs treaty; agreement reached by delegates from over 150 nations creates landmark environmental policy to deal with global warming and innovative new mechanisms to carry it out; accord, known as Kyoto Protocol, will require industrial nations to reduce their emmissions of carbon dioxide and five other heat-trapping greenhouse gases to 5.2 percent below those of 1990; US will be required to cut emissions 7 pecent below 1990 levels, on average, in years from 2008 through 2012; photo (M)




James Bennet analysis contends that under Kyoto agreement, US will have to take more drastic steps than Clinton Administration had hoped to reduce greenhouse emissions; maintains that walking away from treaty, as Vice Pres Gore said he was willing to do, would have enraged environmentalists who are key constituents for him and Pres Clinton; asserts that it would have isolated US as leading emitter of greenhouse gases and only industrial nation unwilling to address problem jointly (M)




Americans would have to make significant sustained cuts in use of fossil fuels in order for US to meet pollution-reduction goals promised at global warming conference in Japan; coal and oil consumption would have to decline by as much as 30 percent from levels now projected for 10-15 years from now; car makers would have to sell more efficient vehicles and consumers would have to be more careful in choosing light bulbs, air conditioners and appliances; Americans have never made such sacrifices, so that political obstacles appear far more formidable than technology challenges (M)




William K Stevens analysis contends that even if participating nations obey Kyoto agreement to cut emissions of greenhouse gases, atmospheric levels of gases, produced chiefly by burning of fossil fuels like coal, will continue to rise; says agreement makes start at dealing with problem in coming decades (M)







British Petroleum Co chief executive John Browne has won grudging approval from some environmentalists, many of whom place his company at forefront of multinationals willing to tackle problem of global warming; Browne praises what he describes as limited progress achieved at Kyoto climate conference; says he hopes future agreements will go further; photo (L)




Editorial contends that Kyoto agreement on greenhouse gases was test of Pres Clinton's political will; maintains that Clinton passed that test, but he must bring same creativity and passion to Senate struggle; asserts that winning Senate approval means defeating treaty's well-financed opponents in business and labor, and that will require extraordinary level of Presidential energy (M)




Solar Energy Industries Association exec dir Scott Sklar says nothing can be better for business than agreement on controlling gases that contribute to global warming; Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates vice pres Mary H Novak predicts that agreement will result in job losses in millions; graph (M)




Clinton Administration says that it will not submit proposed treaty to reduce emissions of climate-altering gases for Senate ratification until developing nations agree to participate in global environmental effort; developing countries at global climate-change conference just ended in Kyoto, Japan, say they will not act until they see rich countries succeed in cutting their own emissions; Pres Clinton defends agreement as 'environmentally strong and economically sound'; Administration officials admit that its flaws make it unacceptable to Senate; photo (M)




Republicans hope to turn agreement to reduce global emissions of greenhouse gases into a weapon to use against Vice Pres Al Gore, portraying it as an unprecedented government seizure of American freedom and sovereignty; note that while public supports strong environmental action, it also supported the basic idea of health insurance for all in 1994 but was nevertheless brought around to see Pres Clinton's health plan as the work of a big-government liberal; others in party urge caution, recalling how Republicans have often fallen on wrong side in environmental debate; Republican opportunity is enhanced by division between Democrats' environmental and labor constituencies (M)







Expansion of Vice Pres Gore's policy-making role in second Clinton Administration discussed; photo of Pres Clinton and Gore walking in lock-step at White House; Clinton is turning more and more Gore as possible successor who could help insure his own legacy, although Gore's role also grows out of their genuine friendship (S)

Emission of greenhouse gases from power plants is likely to be cut at least in part by retiring inefficient coal plants, because coal burned in those plants emits most carbon dioxide; question then becomes what most cost-effective approach is; nuclear reactors produce no carbon dioxide, but they are expenisve and pose environmental risks; experts say it might be preferable to build much larger number of plants running on natural gas, which produce little carbon dioxide; coal remains most widely used fuel for producing electricity, despite some limited inroads by nuclear power; use of oil and gas has declined; chart (L)




Coal has been labeled prime villain in debates over pollution and global warming; coal could be dealt severe blow if proposals to cut carbon dioxide emissions made at recent talks on global warming in Kyoto, Japan, are eventually adopted; some in coal industry remain bullish; they argue that coal is too deeply entrenched to allow any quick, drastic changes; coal-fired plants produce 57 percent of nation's electricity; many coal plants have been upgraded with expensive pollution controls, and new processes promise to cut pollution further; map; photo (L)

EPA study warns that automobile catalytic converters, which have dramatically reduced smog for twenty years, have now become significant and growing cause of global warming; converters break down compounds of nitrogen and oxygen from exhaust that can combine with hydrocarbons and produce smog, but researchers have suspected for years that converters sometime rearrange compounds to form nitrous oxide, which is 300 times as potent as carbon dioxide; new study estimates that nitrous oxide, nearly half of it produced by vehicles, now accounts for about 7.2 percent of gases that cause global warming; increase comes from increasing number of miles traveled by cars with converters, and problem has worsened with more efficient converters; EPA is not proposing solution at this time; official Wylie J Barbour comments (M)




White House will announce that according to analysis by Government scientists, El Nino joined Earth's continuing overall warming trend to break global temperature records in each of first five months of 1998; average surface temperature of Earth in 1997 was highest recorded since people began measuring it with thermometers in mid-19th century; new information extends record-breaking pattern to degree that scientists describe as unprecedented; scientists say global warming appears to be exacerbating effects of El Nino; Vice Pres Al Gore says this is reminder that unless we act we can expect more extreme weather in years ahead; Federal analysis found that average global surface temperature in first five months of 1998 was 1.76 degrees above average of 61.7 degrees for benchmark period of 1961 to 1990; graph (M)

Big American companies press Congress to pass legislation giving them credits for any reductions in waste gases that they achieve before 2008, when a proposed treaty on global warming will begin strictly limiting such emissions; some companies might apply credits against strict limits they face later; companies able to make even deeper cuts in emissions now could sell their surplus credits for billions of dollars under an emissions trading system; legislation could moderate the opposition to treaty among big industry groups and link their financial interests to goal of treaty supporters; if it succeeds, it could revive longstanding Clinton Administration efforts to persuade industries to cut their emissions voluntarily, which have been met with mixed success (M)




Letter by Connie Holmes of Global Climate Coalition says proposal to assure credits for companies that limit greenhouse gas emissions is interesting, but not as useful as endorsing Kyoto protocol on capping use of such fuels




Op-ed column by Jack Kemp and Fred L Smith Jr on Kyoto treaty that seeks to temper 'global warming' by imposing schedule of emissions reductions on so-called greenhouse gases, noting Clinton Adm signed treaty, while Senate rejected treaty as written; questions why some American companies are being seduced by promise of getting credits for any reductions in emissions they achieve before Kyoto treaty would take effect in 2008, and in some cases for reductions already achieved (M)

United States is proposing that efforts to cut levels of heat-trapping gases that may be warming climate give as much credit to countries that use forests and farmers' fields to sop up carbon dioxide, chief greenhouse gas, as for cutting emissions; State Department outlines approach in document filed with United Nations office overseeing talks aimed at carrying out 1997 international accord on averting global warming; Clinton administration officials and some scientists say incentives to plant trees and to farm in ways that lock away carbon are key to stabilizing climate and winning Senate support for any climate treaty; some environmental groups score approach, citing uncertainties about how long plants and soils can continue to absorb carbon; proposal is at odds with European Union stance; 38 other industrialized nations are also set to file proposals (M)




Dr James E Hansen and colleagues at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies report that emphasis on reducing carbon dioxide emissions may be misplaced because the global warming of recent decades has been caused mainly by other heat-trapping emissions that are easier to control, including methane, chlorofluorocarbons, black particles of diesel and coal soot and compounds that create the ozone in smog; also find that burning of fossil fuels, although substantially raising carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere, also produces a pall of particle haze that reflects as much of the sun's energy back into space as the release of carbon dioxide traps in the air; photo (M)

Gregg Easterbrook Op-Ed article examines study by James Hansen, director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, which suggests that basic understanding of greenhouses gases that cause global warming should be overturned and that needed reforms can be more practical and affordable than widely assumed; agrees with findings of Hansen's team that focusing on carbon dioxide may be fundamental error since, while it should be cause for concern, other factors may be equally significant (M)







Saudi Arabia and other Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries members have been insisting at international talks, Lyon, France, aimed at shaping treaty on global warming that any final accord include commitment to compensate them if efforts to cut emissions of heat-trapping gases result in drop in oil use; many developing nations and China back stand, opposed by other participants in newly concluded United Nations-sponsored talks (M)




New study casts doubt on important element of proposed treaty to fight global warming: planting of new forests in an effort to sop up carbon dioxide, a heat-trapping gas; research concludes that old, wild forests are fare better than plantations of young trees at ridding air of carbon dioxide, which is released when coal, oil and other fossil fuels are burned (M)




Vice Pres Al Gore and Gov George W Bush seek to draw sharp distinctions over energy policy, issue on which both candidates have political vulnerabilities; Gore called for government to release oil from Strategic Petroleum Reserve to head off shortages of home heating oil, which Clinton did, even though he and Gore had opposed such a move earlier in year; Bush criticized decision as political ploy; Bush, who worked for years in oil industry, as did his running mate, Dick Cheney, supports opening some environmentally sensitive areas to oil exploration and production (M)




Several Republican senators express strong concerns that talks to flesh out details of global-warming treaty signed by administration in 1998 would never produce document that Senate would approve; their comments come as Frank E Loy, undersecretary of state for global affairs, speaks at joint hearing of Senate Foreign Relations and Energy and Natural Resources Committees in which he defends efforts to transform treaty, Kyoto Protocol, from broad commitment to stem global emissions of greenhouse gases into detailed, enforceable plan (M)




Editorial in series, Campaign 2000, on issues in presidential campaign focuses on 'pronounced' differences between Gov George W Bush and Vice Pres Al Gore on energy policy; says sharp rise in oil prices has given energy new and unexpected prominence but that what ought to be serious debate has been marred by unedifying accusations about who deserves blame for allowing US to sink further into dependence on oil and has diverted attention from inconvenient truths about America's energy problem (M)




Atmospheric scientists differ on where to aim efforts to stave off prospect of global warming from buildup of heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere; some say main target should be carbon dioxide, most common greenhouse gas, while others say most practical solution is to focus first on less common, but more powerful substances possibly influencing climate, like methane, ozone and soot; debate comes just as negotiators from more than 150 countries prepare to head to The Hague to put flesh on bones of 1997 Kyoto Protocol, treaty outlining commitments by industrialized countries to reduce their greenhouse emissions and help poor countries avoid new emissions as their economies grow; photos; graphs; chart (L)

DuPont Co, Shell Oil Co, Alcan Aluminium and four other large companies join growing list of businesses committing themselves to substantial voluntary reductions in releases of heat-trapping greenhouse gases; companies will seek cuts in partnership with Environmental Defense, private environmental group, which will give technical advice and publish audited inventories of companies' emissions of gases; Environmental Defense executive director, Fred Krupp, says if cuts are achieved, by 2010 the companies' annual emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases will be 15 percent below levels measured in 1990; other companies that pledge to cuts are BP, formerly known as BP Amoco, which has already been actively cutting emissions; Suncor Energy of Canada, Pechiney, French aluminum manufacturer, and Ontario Power Generation (M)




International panel of climate scientists concludes that greenhouse gases produced mainly by burning of fossil fuels are altering atmosphere in ways that affect earth's climate, and it is likely they have contributed to warming over last 50 years; this represents significant shift in tone for panel, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; its two previous assessments were not as confident of finding on role of humans in climate change (M)




Editorial notes that Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report has concluded that mankind's contribution to global warming is greater than originally believed; holds that finding should give added urgency to upcoming meeting in Hague, where most of world's nations will try to work out details of 1997 Kyoto Protocol, treaty intended to cut man-made releases of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases




Bob Herbert Op-Ed column on global warming discusses recent climate assessment of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which concludes that human activity is contributing substantially to warming of planet, and that warming over next century could turn out to be much worse than previously estimated (M)




Al Gore's Journey, article in series on Vice Pres Al Gore's political career, says case can be made that he has been most active and influential vice president in American history; Clinton administration has done little in last eight years in which he has not played some role, and he is considered as at least second most influential adviser to president after Hillary Rodham Clinton; he often was quickest to push aggressive approach, whether on foreign policy, or on budgets or on trade, but his advice has not always been accepted; those who work closely with him say his steadiness and strength is often welcome contrast to pliancy of president, who seems to waver on his commitments to people and to policy, particularly early in his administration; what mystifes many is that while Gore is often bold and forceful in councils of government, he has stumbled as presidential candidate, failing to capitalize on his significant record of accomplishment to make case for his election; photos (L)

Pres Clinton calls for new federal regulations limiting power plants' emissions of carbon dioxide, gas believed to cause global warming, through system similar to rules currently in place for pollutants that cause smog and acid rain; calls for similar controls on emissions of mercury, pollutant given off by some power plants but not regulated by air pollution laws; proposes 'cap and trade' system under which government will set national limit on emissions, and divide pollution allowances among power plants; companies could cut emissions enough to stay within allowances, or could cut even more of emissions and sell leftover allowances to other companies that might have cut emissions less extensively and therefore needed more allowances (M)




Kyoto Protocol, treaty aimed at curtailing global warming, faces its greatest obstacles yet in next two weeks as officials from around world meet in The Hague to tussle over fine print; talks come on heels of new scientific reports providing strongest evidence so far that people, mainly through burning of fossil fuel, have contributed substantially to warming trend that could disrupt weather patterns and ecosystems worldwide; treaty requires industrialized nations to reduce releases of carbon dioxide and other gases that trap heat in atmosphere; has been signed by more representatives of more than 100 countries, including US, but cannot take effect until substantial number of industrial nations ratify it, which none have so far done; US presidential election may have clouded accord's future; opposition to it by Gov George W Bush and uncertainty that Vice Pres Al Gore could win support in Senate if he is elected noted; photo; chart (M)




Letter from Dr Paul R Epstein says Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports nations have underestimated rate and impact of climate change




Critical talks on treaty to fight global warming enter third day at The Hague; Dept of Energy issues study addressing main point of contention: whether United States could do more to reduce its addiction to fossil fuels; study finds inexpensive, fairly simple changes in American energy policies could go long way toward cutting emissions of carbon dioxide, dominant greenhouse gas; with 4 percent of world's population, US produces 25 percent of heat-trapping gases; US is feeling growing pressure to commit to reductions (M)




American negotiators, shifting stance at talks on global warming treaty, say US would be willing to limit its use of forest projects to reach target for reducing heat-trapping greenhouse gases; shift brightens prospects for treaty; comes in face of mounting criticism from Europe and private environmental groups; disagreements in pivotal negotiations have focused on forests as 'sinks,' in which carbon dioxide is removed by trees which store carbon in wood and soil (M)

Last-minute disputes between European and American negotiators result in collapse of negotiations aimed at finishing treaty to curb global warming; breakdown follows two weeks of intensive talks in Hague, stunning many participants, environmental groups and observers; Frank E Loy, top American negotiator, agrees with several European participants that effort should continue, even when he and Clinton administration hand over task to new administration; talks are riven by conflicting agendas; poor countries seek billions of dollars to help them adapt to climate change, and rich nations seek to blunt economic impact of treaty by finding least costly ways to cut their emissions of warming gases; latest failure attributed to persistent disagreement between industrial powers on opposite sides of Atlantic over role of trees and properly managed farmland in acting as 'sinks' to absorb carbon dioxide, dominant greenhouse gas; photo (M)







Analysis of collapse of pivotal negotiations aimed at completing Kyoto Protocol, pioneering climate treaty; environmental groups that joined representatives of 175 countries at The Hague were themselves sharply split; some favored pragmatic, if imperfect, approach, while others were unyielding, equating compromise with corruption; when hard-liners ended up working in parallel with business interests who fought treaty to avoid limits on industrial emissions, result was deadlock; photos (M)




Editorial laments that 170 countries gathered in The Hague to address threat of global warming fell short of main objective to translate 1997 Kyoto Accord into detailed, enforceable treaty; says recriminations should not obscure fact that significant progress was made on important issues or diminish resolve of nations to move ahead at next meeting in May 2001 (M)

Critics say Bush administration is being left on sidelines in international talks that could shape treaty curtailing global warming, because it is only slowly turning to climate issues; say administration is betraying lack of urgency; frustration is coming mainly from some Republican officials and representatives of energy-related businesses, who see huge costs resulting from climate treaty; they say administration has essentially been mute in face of day-to-day events at United Nations (M)




Editorial says rapid erosion of snows of Kilimanjaro and steady retreat of mountaintop glaciers elsewhere is further dramatic evidence of relentless warming of earth's atmosphere that cannot be explained by normal climate shifts and is at least partly traceable to burning of fossil fuels; urges Pres Bush to pay more attention to global warming, rethink his opposition to Kyoto Protocol, the 1997 draft treaty on issue, and even provide some leadership on issue (M)




Bush administration, some influential Republicans in Congress and several big owners of coal-burning power plants join in advocating bill that would curb emissions of carbon dioxide by power plants; move to curb emissions of the gas, widely thought to contribute to global warming, faces fierce opposition by conservative Republicans and some industry groups; these critics say emissions cuts would harm economy and clash with administration's goal of raising energy supplies; chart compares carbon emissions from coal, oil and natural gas plants; photo (M)




Pres Bush, under pressure from conservatives and industry groups, reneges on campaign promise to regulate power plants' emissions of carbon dioxide, considered key factor in global warming; environmental groups and some Congressional Democrats are angered at they see as major betrayal; White House says promise was inconsistent with goal of increasing energy production; Bush explains in letter to four senators who had criticized pledge; administration declines to say if EPA Admr Christine Whitman backs change; says views of Vice Pres Cheney and Energy Sec Spencer Abraham were most important; Bush says regulating emissions would have raised electricity prices at time of shortages in California; claims he remains committed to improving air quality by reducing emissions of nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide and mercury, which are already regulated; environmental leaders denounce Bush as 'turncoat'; industry lobbyists and conservative Republicans are joyful (M)




Editorial says Pres Bush's decision not to regulate emissions of carbon dioxide, main global warming gas, betrays his campaign promise, embarrasses his administrator of Environmental Protection Agency, Christie Whitman, angers Europeans and creates needless headaches for his secretary of state, Colin Powell; holds that despite Bush's protestations to contrary, one can conclude only that political considerations prompted his decision




Pres Bush, defending his reversal of campaign pledge, says 'energy crisis' threatens nation's economic health, causing him to decide not to try to regulate power plants' emissions of carbon dioxide; White House officials say any plan to limit emissions of gas, widely seen as contributor to global warming, would have pushed electricity prices up, and could have compounded energy shortages; say Bush concluded week ago that promise he made in campaign was 'an error'; many Bush supporters outside White House say his move also reflects power of last-minute pressure campaign from Congressional Republicans and industry leaders; environmentalists say Bush has passed up important chance to address global warming, most dire problem facing environment; photo (M)




Analysis: Pres Bush's reversal on campaign pledge to cut power plant emissions highlights difficulty of controlling carbon dioxide, which many scientists say is chief cause of global warming; chief sticking point is that carbon dioxide, unlike more familiar forms of pollution, is unavoidable byprodict of burning fuels (M)




Experts say Pres Bush's decision to withdraw United States from Kyoto Protocol will doom international agreement intended to curtail global warming; critics of Kyoto welcome Bush's unambiguous statement, but others note that process of reducing carbon-dioxide emissions will have to be dealt with by Bush regardless of his opposition to treaty itself (M)







Op-Ed article by David G Victor notes that Pres Bush met barrage of criticism when he backed away from regulating carbon dioxide emissions, but he may actually have improved chances for slowing manmade changes in world's climate; says Kyoto Protocol's strict targets and timetables for controlling emissions of greenhouse gases are hopelessly unrealistic; says United States, along with other industrialized countries, have recorded rising, not falling emissions; says Bush's rejection of Kyoto limits will force United States to build alternative plan; says administration and Congress shold assemble sensible package to sharply increase funding for research and development on affordable ways to move economy away from fossil fuels and raise efficiency of fossil-fuel burning in interim; drawing (M)




Ben Lieberman letter on demise of Kyoto climate accord, and United States' role in greenhouse gas emissions




Global warming will be main issue at coming meeting of Western Hemisphere's environment ministers; United States, which will be represented by Christie Whitman, adminstrator of Environmental Protection Agency, will be in position of having no policy on issue; Pres Bush has said he opposes Kyoto Protocol and would not submit it for Senate ratification; Whitman, who was overruled by White House in matter of power plant emissions of carbon dioxide, has reportedly tried in vain to obtain clear instructions from White House about how to answer questions from US allies concerned about that policy (M)




European Union expresses dismay at latest confirmation by Bush administration that it opposes treaty to combat global climate change; White House spokesman, Ari Fleischer, reconfirms that Pres Bush opposes pact, in part because it does not bind developing nations to curb emissions of heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide (S)







Pres Bush, speaking at second news conference of his presidency, makes most expansive statements on Middle East since assuming office; says Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, should hear 'loud and clear' that United States wants him to 'stop the violence'; Bush urges Israel to exercise restraint in its military actions but reserves most pointed language for Arafat; Bush says he has instructed Secretary of State Colin L Powell to call Arafat to reiterate his message on halting violence; administration officials say strong words about Arafat and renewed frustration with him stem in part from his demands for vote on Security Council resolution seeking United Nations observer force in Israeli occupied territories; United States vetoed move; photo (M)




Editorial says German Chancellor Gerhard Schroder epitomizes new independence of American allies in Europe; says Pres Bush should heed Schroder's pleas for faster cuts in emissions of greenhouse gases; says administration should try to improve Kyoto treaty, not kill it; says it should also address concerns about missile defense plans that could unnecessarily increase tensions with Russia







White House has abandoned any pretense of support for Kyoto treaty, and Christie Whitman, administrator of Environmental Protection Agency, hears dismay and disappointment from her counterparts attending meeting of Environmental Ministers of the Americas in Montreal; Whitman insists that Bush administration is committed to full engagement with international community on global warming, but she offers no alternative to Kyoto agreement it has rejected; photo (M)

Bob Herbert Op-Ed column says Pres Bush's decision to reneg on campaign pledge to seek reductions in carbon dioxide emissions, and his rejection of Kyoto accord, should not be suprise to anyone familiar with his record as governor of Texas, state with worst environmental record, according to Sierra Club; says there is also no surprise that Bush-Cheney administration is attempting to do serious damage to programs that help children, given fact that Texas never complied with consent decree requiring it to provide appropriate health care services to 1.5 million children eligible for Medicaid, and given Cheney's voting record while in Congress on matters related to children (M)




Op-Ed article by George Packer says Democrats, who in 2000 won presidential popular vote, equal split in Senate and stayed about even in House, have retreated to defensive cringe, reflecting psychology of defeat that is so strongly ingrained in Democrats; says now, out of power, Democrats enjoy luxury of being opposition party closer to majority of Americans than is party in power, but Democratic leaders say nothing about Bush presidency's seeming governing ideology: 'long live big business'; says Democratic Party, along with Republican Party, have become nothing but fund-raising machines; says only way to change direction is hard way, from below, much as grass-roots Republicans did after Barry Goldwater's landslide defeat in 1964; drawings (M)

William Safire Op-Ed column says multilateral treaties that weaken United States do not strengthen freedom abroad; says Pres Bush is right to reject Kyoto Protocol, which would have forced US to roll back its emission of carbon dioxide in this decade to 7 percent below 1990 levels--at immeasurable cost in economic growth and jobs; says Bush should also reject calls to sign treaty establishing International Criminal Court; says its goal sounds noble, but agreement would empower court to arrest, try and imprison American, Israeli and other citizens of democracies for undefined crime of 'aggression'; says its prosecutor would surely accede to Arab League request to indict Israeli soldiers, and any US officeholder who dared to offend local dictator (M)




Anthony Lewis Op-Ed column says policy changes by Bush administration are outraging most moderate of environmental organizations, but latest environmental move is notable for its sweeping character and slippery means; says Bush budget proposal would undermine lawsuits to require listing of particular animals and plants as endangered species; says Bush should consult, consider other side's interests and try to find mutual accommodations, as he did to resolve imbroglio with China; says on environmental issues, above all, unilaterialism is dangerous to him (M)







Environmental Protection Agency's new administrator, Christie Whitman, appears at recent meeting of Business Roundtable, group of corporate executives, promising that agency's history of 'banging heads' is thing of past; her bluntly antiregulatory message undercuts notion that she is at least moderately gung-ho green hung out to dry by Pres Bush when he broke his campaign pledge to put cap on power plants' emissions of carbon dioxide, and then wrote off Kyoto Protocol, international treaty on climate change; allies say Whitman differs with president less on policy than on politics of decisions that have been viewed as unfriendly to environment; suggest Whitman is far less liberal than her reputation; photo (M)

Editorial on Earth Day and Pres Bush's actions that go against years of environmental protection efforts; sees signs that administration is beginning to take note of polls showing moderate voters do not like his approach




Congressional Democrats have found rallying cry and gone on offensive against Pres Bush for early environmental rollbacks; concerted public relations campaign, amplified in television advertising by environmental advocacy groups, is expected to reach crescendo on Apr 22, 31st anniversary of Earth Day; Democrats with eye on 2002 House and Senate elections say several of Bush's environmental actions and proposals have given them way to appeal to swing voters who will matter most: suburban mothers and independents whom Bush courted with his emphasis on education (M)




Time may be drawing near for building new nuclear power plants in US; reactors are so desirable that when old ones go on sale, bidding wars have broken out; Bush administration's energy plan is expected to include strong support for new reactor construction; supporters say that with improved reliability and design, new generation of reactors will be less expensive to operate than competing sources of electricity; nuclear waste remains an obstacle, but supporters believe that either a burial spot will be found or plants will be built to break down waste or reuse it; photos; graph (M)




Bush administration, having rejected Kyoto Protocol, seeks advice from wide array of scientists, economists, business representatives and policy experts as it tries to forge new approach to issue of global warming; senior government officials say most of those consulted are asserting that science points to serious problem with need for concrete action to stem rising levels of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping greenhouse gases emitted by smokestacks and tailpipes (M)




Editorial on Pres Bush's first hundred days in office; cites emergence of deep-rooted, unnuanced and sometimes truculent conservatism from man once regarded as moderate; holds he passed first major foreign policy tests in handling of spy plane downed by China and limitation of arms sales to Taiwan; cites foreign policy tussle between State Sec Colin Powell and Defense Sec Donald Rumsfeld; holds Bush has seemed clumsy and amateurish in public appearances in comparison to predecessors




Pres Bush, who assumed office vowing to change tone of Washington and policies of his predecessors, has been forced to change in his first 100 days, by moderating his own tone and by accepting compromises on some of his top priorities; is discovering that presidents must pick fights with care; changes in his approach are subtle, and aides insist he is governing nation with same principles and approach used in governing Texas; detractors say he has proven far more conservative in White House than he appeared as candidate, but admit he is far more confident leader than when he took office; photos (M)

Editorial says Pres Bush's five-day trip to Europe is shaping up as important test of foreign affairs leadership for one of nation's least-traveled modern presidents; holds that trip could give him fuller firsthand understanding of leaders and issues animating European continent; says Bush needs to listen carefully to concerns of European leaders and recognize that American leadership is most effective when exercised in concert with Europe, not in opposition to it (M)




Scientists and experts on risk management agree with assertion by Pres Bush that much remains to be learned about potential impact of global warming, but take issue with idea that uncertainty justifies further delay in acting to limit climate change; say question of how much warming is too much constitutes 'red herring,' and that it is more important to start from point of widest agreement, namely: that rising concentrations of heat-trapping gases are warming atmosphere, and that adding lot more is probably bad idea (M)







Pres Bush reiterates opposition to 1997 Kyoto protocol on global warming, aimed at reducing reducing emissions of greenhouse gases below 1990 levels, on eve of five day trip to Europe, whose leaders support it; strongly suggests that any new accord bind developing nations, especially China and India, to same commitments made by US; acknowledges severity of problem, but notes accord sets no standards for major emitters of greenhouse gases while creating mandates for US that could prove economically crippling; aides argue that accord was written to make it easier for Europe than for US to meet goals; Bush vows US will lead way by advancing science on climate change; describes several new research initiatives that could mark potentially significant focusing of American climate study; photo (M)

Pres Bush says major reason for his rejection of proposed agreement to stem global warming is that it would require industrialized countries to cut heat-trapping gas emissions while exempting developing countries from similar obligations; many experts in international environmental law and policy say Bush administration's insistence on binding commitments by all countries at same time runs counter to principle that has shaped almost every other recent environmental treaty: cleanups should be started by prosperous countries because they created bulk of problem and have money and technology to fix it; photo; graph (M)




Letter from Albert Liebman calls for serious debate in Congress on issues that have have split America's European allies: Pres Bush's opposition to Kyoto Protocol and his intention of proceeding unilaterally with missile defense system







America's Roman Catholic bishops vote unanimously to issue statement calling for immediate action to mitigate effects of global climate change; statement steers clear of roiling debate between Bush administration and many environmentalists over 1997 global warming agreement; rather, bishops set down principles for guiding country's approach to what they acknowledge is complicated issue; their statement asserts that United States, because of its wealth, its position in world and its record as heavy producer of heat-trapping gases, must play special role in protecting planet; document follows more than decade of increasingly outspoken interest by bishops on environment (M)

Editorial says World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg will be long on good intentions and short on specific solutions, judging by earlier conclaves; says Pres Bush's absence is regrettable and reinforces his well-deserved reputation for indifference to environmental problems and reflexive hostility to multilateral remedies




Bjorn Lomborg Op-Ed article says real challenging facing United Nations World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg is whether world can shift emphasis away from environmental sustainability and more toward economic development; argues that scientific evidence does not support commonly accepted warnings by Western developed nations that environment is in poor shape and natural resources are running out; says US has unique oppurtunity in Johannesburg to recast decision rejecting earlier Kyoto Protocol as attempt to focus on most important and fundamental issues on global agenda, namely: clean drinking water, better sanitation and health care and fight against poverty; drawing (M)

Pres Bush, who after last Sept 11 declared terrorism to be 'focus' of his untried administration, has kept that priority despite year in which economy, corporate scandals and Middle East violence have blown him off course; Bush now seems determined to use attack to justify this year's pursuit of Iraq's Saddam Hussein, even though two are clearly not yet linked in minds of his fellow Americans or European allies; linkage in Bush's mind between Osama bin Laden and Hussein has created pre-emption policy encapsulating Bush view that US must strike before it is struck again; Bush's most hawkish advisers in fact urged action against Hussein in first days after Sept 11, even absent any evidence that he was involved; adviser Condoleezza Rice insists there is no choice but to depart from Bush's campaign promise of 'humble foreign policy'; Bush begins each day by reviewing 'threat assessment,' compilation of latest US intelligence, and aides say daily reminders have sharpened and sobered him (M)

Editorial on voters' decreased stress on environmental issues in midterm election; blames both Bush administration's skill at hiding its worrisome indifference to environment and failure of Democrats to challenge Bush's agenda in serious, coordinated fashion




Round of international climate talks is held in New Delhi, and focus is on adapting to global warming instead of fighting to limit emissions of gases responsible for it; many environmentalists have long avoided discussing adaptation for fear it would smack of defeatism; shift is partly driven by unusual weather this year and fear that costs of weather-related disasters will rise with global warming; another impetus is rising realization that many significant shifts have already been set in motion by century-long accumulation of warming gases; photos (M)

Article examines train of miscalculations and misunderstandings in handling of crisis with Iraq that have produced setback for American diplomacy and international prestige; policymakers in US and abroad cite international anger over Bush administration's opposition to Kyoto global warming agreement, several arms control treaties and other mechanisms of international law; some administration officials acknowledge mixed messages undercut US claim that it wanted to avoid war as White House seemingly switched from aim to disarm Iraq to aim of defeating its leaders; other observers say by seizing on first report by chief UN weapons inspector Hans Blix as prima facie case for war, US and Britain made Blix even more cautious in his conclusions; some critics blame Sec of State Colin L Powell for not engaging in shuttle diplomacy to build support worldwide, but Powell's defenders blame blunt criticism of Europe by Defense Sec Donald H Rumsfeld, which undercut efforts to build support there; American tactics also backfired as diplomats tried to persuade smaller, undecided countries to accept faster timetable for weapons inspections, only to generate increasing resentment; assertions that Iraq was linked to Al Qaeda also backfired since European intelligence services told leaders even CIA had doubts about connection; Pres Bush's efforts to paint grand vision of democracy in Arab world starting with Iraq also raised doubts, with France gained support by warning US has dreams of remaking Middle East in its own image of democracy; photos (M)




Editorial says looming war with Iraq crowns period of terrible diplomatic failure by Bush administration; holds that failure may end up risking not America's power, but an essential part of its glory; says at time when America most needs world to see its actions in best possible light, they will probably be seen in worst and that war for legitimate international goal against execrable tyranny will be fought almost alone




US is being left out of emissions trading; US preached importance of market solution to reduce greenhouse gas emissions during negotiations over Kyoto Protocol; Canada ratified treaty in December, meaning plan to reduce greenhouse gases is one nation shy of becoming law in more than 100 countries; heart of treaty is emissions-trading plan that closely resembles what US originally proposed; Steve Drummond, managing director of greenhouse gas brokerage in London calls CO2e.com, says Europe can dominate emissions trading market now that Americans are out; David Doniger, former Kyoto treaty negotiator under Pres Bill Clinton, says when Pres Bush pulled out in cavalier way he did, he galvanized everyone around world to make it work; photo (M)

Editorial questions motive of Pres Bush's sudden announcement proposing series of meetings of worlds' biggests greenhouse gas emitters to develop long-term 'global strategy' for dealing with climate change; suggests Bush's real goal is to leave problem to his successor




Pres Bush proposes for first time to set 'long-term global goal' for cutting greenhouse gas emissions; invotes other high-polluting nations to join US in talks aimed at reaching accord by end of next year; if carried through, such an agreement would be major shift for Bush, who has resisted absolute goals and steadfastly rejected so-called Kyoto Protocol which limits greenhouse gas emissions; Bush makes his proposal in speech at United States Agency for International Development; his administration has been grappling with climate change as scientific consensus has continued to build in favor of action to control buildup of heat-trapping gases in atmosphere; his speech is greeted with intense skepticism by environmental advocates and some European officials; critics accuse him of trying to hijack continuing environmental talks like those under Kyoto treaty by substituting his own program, which even if successful would not bear fruit until he is about to leave office in 2009; they note that Bush failed to list steps US would take to limit emissions over next 10 to 20 years, while he works on longterm goals for next 50 years and beyond; photo; timeline of Bush's speeches and actions on global warming since Mar 2001, when he rejected Kyoto treaty (L)




Pres Bush's unexpected announcement that US will gather world's largest emitters of greenhouse gases to seek long-term global reduction in emissions has thrown Washington's European allies, particularly Germany, off balance; Chancellor Angela Merkel's plan would require sharp reduction in emissions; Bush's vaguely worded proposal has muddled what had been shaping up as black-and-white showdown between Europe and US (M)
