I	O
believe	O

enemies	O

It	O
is	O

of	O

what	O

And	O
then	O
the	O
second	O
thing	O
we	O
have	O
to	O
do	O
is	O
to	O
make	O
absolutely	O

none	O

this	O

anything	O
that	O
our	O

I	O
think	O
that	O
's	O
very	O
important	O

Then	O
after	O
that	O
,	O
we	O
'll	O
have	O
a	O
category	O
of	O

and	O
I	O
will	O
just	O
go	O
down	O

that	O
it	O

that	O

the	O

could	O
be	O
balanced	O
a	O
lot	O
sooner	O
if	O
you	O

had	O

enacted	O
$	O
95	O
billion	O
in	O
tax	O

?	O
	
A	O
:	O
 	O
	
Well	O
,	O
let	O
me	O
say	O
this	O
,	O
if	O
we	O
had	O
n't	O
done	O
anything	O
,	O
if	O
we	O
'd	O
had	O
no	O
tax	O
cuts	O
and	O
no	O
other	O
changes	O
,	O
our	O
estimates	O
are	O
--	O
keep	O
in	O
mind	O
these	O
tax	O
cuts	O
are	O
over	O
a	O
five	O
-	O
year	O
period	O
--	O
our	O
estimates	O
are	O
that	O
we	O
would	O
have	O
a	O
deficit	O
which	O
would	O
rise	O
over	O
the	O
next	O
five	O

and	O
stay	O
at	O
about	O
the	O
level	O
of	O
$	O
100	O
billion	O

So	O
you	O
can	O
also	O
say	O
that	O
if	O
we	O
had	O
n't	O
spent	O
$	O
24	O
billion	O
on	O
children	O
's	O
health	O
care	O
,	O
we	O
could	O
balance	O

abolished	O
the	O
spending	O
on	O
education	O
we	O
could	O
do	O
it	O

 	O

question	O
is	O

80	O

the	O

the	O

that	O

that	O
this	O

has	O
had	O
to	O
bear	O

to	O
give	O
the	O

is	O
rather	O

to	O
be	O

because	O

then	O
there	O

the	O
question	O
of	O
whether	O
the	O

what	O

The	O

I	O

that	O

over	O

have	O
something	O

it	O
's	O
a	O

have	O
not	O

if	O
