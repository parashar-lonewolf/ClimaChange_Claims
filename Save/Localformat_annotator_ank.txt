Following is the official text of the economic declaration issued today at the end of the summit conference of the seven leading industrialized democracies: We, the heads of state or government of the seven major industrialized countries and the representatives of the European Community, have met in Venice from 8 to 10 June 1987, to review the progress that our countries have made, individually and collectively, in carrying out the policies to which we committed ourselves at earlier summits.We remain determined to pursue these policies for growth, stability, employment, and prosperity for our countries and for the world economy.We can look back on a number of positive developments since we met a year ago.Growth is continuing into its fifth consecutive year, albeit at lower rates.Average inflation rates have come down.Interest rates have generally declined.Changes have occurred in relationships among leading currencies which over time will contribute to a more sustainable pattern of current account positions and have brought exchange rates within ranges broadly consistent with economic fundamentals.In volume terms the adjustment of trade flows is under way, although in nominal terms imbalances so far remain too large. Macro-Economic Policies and Exchange Rates3.Since Tokyo, the summit countries have intensified their economic policy coordination with a view to insuring internal consistency of domestic policies and their international campatibility.This is essential to achieving stronger and sustained global growth, reduced external imbalances and more stable echange relationships.Given the policy agreements at the Louvre and in Washington, further susbstantial shifts in exchange rates could prove counterproductive to efforts to increase growth and facilitate adjustment.We reaffirm our commitment to the swift and the full implementation of those agreements.4.We now need to overcome the problems that nevertheless remain in some of our countries: external imbalances that are still large; persistently high unemployment; large public sector deficits; and high levels of real interest rates.There are also continuing trade restrictions and increased protectionist pressures, persistent weakness of many primary commodity markets, and reduced prospects for developing countries to grow, find the markets they need and service their foreign debt.5.The correction of external imbalances will be a long and difficult process.Exchange rate changes alone will not solve the problem of correcting these imbalances while sustaining growth.Surplus countries will design their policies to strengthen domestic demand and reduce external surpluses while maintaining price stability.Deficit countries, while following policies designed to encourage steady low-inflation growth, will reduce their fiscal and external imbalances.6.We call on other industrial countries to participate in the effort to sustain economic activity worldwide.We also call on newly industrialized economies with rapid growth and large external surpluses to assume greater responsibility for preserving an open world trading system by reducing trade barriers and pursuing policies that allow their currencies more fully to reflect underlying fundamentals.7.Among the summit countries, budgetary discipline remains an important medium-term objective and the reduction of existing public sector imbalances a necessity for a number of them.Those summit countries which have made significant progress in fiscal consolidation and have large external surpluses remain committed to following fiscal and monetary policies designed to strengthen domestic growth, within a framework of medium-term fiscal objectives.Monetary policy should also support noninflationary growth and foster stability of exchange rates.In view of the outlook for low inflation in many countries, a further market-led decline of interest rates would be helpful. Structural Policies8.We also agree on the need for effective structural policies especially for creating jobs.To this end we shall:  * Promote competition in order to speed up industrial adjustment;  * Reduce major imbalances between agricultural supply and demand;  * Facilitate job creating investment;  * Improve the functioning of labor markets;  * Promote the further opening of internal markets;  * Encourage the elimination of capital market imperfections and restrictions and the improvement of the functioning of international financial markets.

Multilateral Surveillance and Policy Coordination9.We warmly welcome the progress achieved by the Group of Seven Finance Ministers in developing and implementing strengthened arrangements for multilateral surveillance and economic coordination as called for in Tokyo last year.The new process of coordination, involving the use of economic indicators, will enhance efforts to achieve more consistent and mutually compatible policies by our countries.10.The heads of state or government reaffirm the important policy commitments and undertakings adopted at the Louvre and Washington meetings of the Group of Seven, including those relating to exchange rates.They agree that, if in the future world economic growth is insufficient, additional actions will be required to achieve their common objectives.Accordingly, they call on their Finance Ministers to develop, if necessary, additional appropriate policy measures for this purpose and to continue to cooperate closely to foster stability of exchange rates.11.The coordination of economic policies is an ongoing process which will evolve and become more effective over time.The heads of state or government endorse the understandings reached by the Group of Seven Finance Ministers to strengthen, with the assistance of the International Monetary Fund, the surveillance of their economies using economic indicators including exchange rates, in particular by:  * The commitment by each country to develop medium-term objectives and projections for its economy, and for the group to develop objectives and projections, that are mutually consistent both individually and collectively; and  *The use of performance indicators to review and assess current economic trends and to determine whether there are significant deviations for an intended course that require consideration of remedial actions.12.The heads of state or government consider these measures important steps toward promoting sustained noninflationary global growth and greater currency stability.They call upon the Group of Seven Finance Ministers and central bank governors to:  * Intensify their coordination efforts with a view to achieving prompt and effective implementation of the agreed policy undertakings and commitments;  * Monitor economic developments closely in cooperation with the managing director of the I.M.F.; and  * Consider further improvements as appropriate to make the coordination process more effective. Trade13.We note rising protectionist pressures with grave concern.The Uruguay Round can play an important role in maintaining and strengthening the multilateral trading system, and achieving increased liberalization of trade for the benefit of all countries.Recognizing the interrelationship among growth, trade and development, it is essential to improve the multilateral system based on the principles and rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and bring about a wider coverage of world trade under agreed, effective and enforceable multilateral discipline.Protectionist actions would be counterproductive, would increase the risk of further exchange rate instability and would exacerbate the problems of development and indebtedness.14.We endorse fully the commitment to adopt appropriate measures in compliance with the principles of stand-still and rollback which have been reaffirmed in the Ministerial Declaration on the Uruguay Round.It is important to establish in the GATT a multilateral framework of principles and rules for trade in services, trade-related investment measures and intellectual property rights.This extension of the multilateral trading system would also be beneficial to developing countries in fostering growth and enhancing trade, investment and technology transfers.15.Basing ourselves on the ministerial declaration on the Uruguay Round and on the principles of the GATT, we call on all contracting parties to negotiate comprehensively, in good faith and with all due despatch, with a view to ensuring mutual advantage and increased benefits to all participants.Canada, Japan, the United States and the European Community will table a wide range of substantive proposals in Geneva over the coming months.Progress in the Uruguay Round will be kept under close political review.In this context the launching, the conduct and the implementation of the outcome of the negotiations should be treated as parts of a single undertaking; however, agreements reached at an early stage might be implemented on a provisional or a definitive basis by agreement prior to the formal conclusion of the negotiations, and should be taken into account in assessing the overall balance of the negotiations.16.A strong, credible, working GATT is essential to the well-being of all trading countries and is the best bulwark against mounting bilateral protectionist pressures.The functioning of the GATT should be improved through ensuring better coordination between the GATT and the IMF and the World Bank.We consider that it would be useful to have, as appropriate, in the course of the negotiations, a meeting of the Trade Negotiating Committee at the Ministerial level.  Agriculture17.At Tokyo we recognized the serious nature of the agricultural problem.We agreed that the structure of agricultural production needed to be adjusted in the light of world demand, and expressed our determination to give full support to the work of the O.E.C.D. in this field.In doing so, we all recognized the importance of agriculture to the well-being of our rural communities.In the past year, we have actively pursued the approach outlined at Tokyo, and we take satisfaction from the agreement in the Ministerial Declaration adopted in Punta del Este on the objectives for the negotiations on agriculture in the Uruguay Round.18.We reaffirm our commitment to the important agreement on agriculture set out in the O.E.C.D. ministerial communique of May 13, 1987; in particular, the statement of the scope and urgency of the problem which require that a concerted reform of agricultural policies be implemented in a balanced and flexible manner; the assessment of the grave implications, for developed and developing countries alike, of the growing imbalances in supply of the demand for the main agricultural products; the acknowledgment of shared responsibility for the problems as well as for their equitable, effective and durable resolution; the principles of reform and the action required.The long-term objective is to allow market signals to influence the orientation of agricultural production, by way of a progressive and concerted reduction of agricultural support, as well as by all other appropriate means, giving consideration to social and other concerns, such as food security, environmental protection and overall employment.19.We underscore our commitment to work in concert to achieve the necessary adjustments of agricultural policies, both at home and through comprehensive negotiations in the Uruguay Round.In this as in other fields, we will table comprehensive proposals for negotiations in the coming months to be conducted in accordance with the mandate in the Ministerial Declaration, and we intend to review at our next meeting the progress achieved and the tasks that remain.20.In the meantime, in order to create a climate of greater confidence which would enhance the prospect for rapid progress in the Uruguay Round as a whole and as a step towards the longterm result to be expected from those negotiations, we have agreed, and call upon other countgries to agree, to refrain from actions which, by further stimulating production of agricultural commodities in surplus, increasing protection or destabilizing world markets, would worsen the negotiating climate and, more generally, damage trade relations. Developing Countries and Debt21.We attach particular importance to fostering stable economic progress in developing countries, with all their diverse situations and needs.The problems of many heavily indebted developing countries are a cause of economic and political concern and can be a threat to political stability in countries with democratic regimes.We salute the courageous efforts of many of these countries to achieve economic growth and stability.22.We underline the continuing importance of official development assistance and welcome the increased efforts of some of our countries in this respect.We recall the target already established by international organizations (0.7 percent) for the future level of official development assistance and we take note that overall financial flows are important to development.We strongly support the activities of international financial institutions, including those regional development banks which foster policy reforms by borrowers and finance their programs of structural adjustment.In particular:  *We support the central role of the I.M.F. through its advice and financing and encourage closer cooperation between the I.M.F. and the World Bank, especially in their structural adjustment lending;  * We note with satisfaction the contribution made by the eighth replenishment of the International Development Association;  * We support a general capital increase of the World Bank when justified by increased demand for quality lending, by its expanded role in the debt strategy and by the necessity to maintain the financial stability of the institution;  * In the light of the different contributions of our countries to official development assistance, we welcome the recent initiative of the Japanese Government in bringing forward a new scheme which will increase the provision of resources from Japan to developing countries.23.For the major middle-income debtors, we continue to support the present growth-oriented case-by-case strategy.Three elements are needed to strengthen the growth prospects of debtor countries: the adoption of comprehensive macroeconomic and structural reforms by debtor countries themselves; the enhancement of lending by international financial institutions, in particular the World Bank; and adequate commercial bank lending in support of debtor country reforms.We shall play our part by helping to sustain growth and expand trade.A number of debt agreements have allowed some resumption of growth, correction of imbalances, and significant progress in restoring the creditworthiness of some countries.But some still lack adequate policies for structural adjustment and growth designed to encourage the efficient use of domestic savings, the repatriation of flight capital, increased flows of foreign direct investment, and in particular reforms of financial markets.24.There is equally a need for timely and effective mobilization of lending by commercial banks.In this context, we support efforts by commercial banks and debtor countries to develop a ''menu'' of alternative negotiating procedures and financing techniques for providing continuing support to debtor countries.25.Measures should be taken, particularly by debtor countries, to facilitate non-debt-creating capital flows, especially direct investment.In this connection, the Multilateral Investment Guarantees Agency should begin to serve its objectives as soon as possible.It is important to maintain flexibility on the part of export credit agencies in promptly resuming or increasing cover for countries that are implementing comprehensive adjustment programs.26.We recognize the problems of developing countries whose economies are solely or predominantly dependent on exports of primary commodities the prices of which are persistently depressed.It is important that the functioning of commodity markets should be improved, for example through better information and greater transparency.Further diversification of these economies should be encouraged, with the help of the international financial institutions, through policies to support their efforts for improved processing of their products, to expand opportunities through market access liberalization, and to strengthen the international environment for structural change.27.We recognize that the problems of some of the poorest countries, primarily in the sub-Saharan Africa, are uniquely difficult and need special treatment.These countries are characterized by such features as acute poverty, limited resources to invest in their own development, unmanageable debt burdens, heavy reliance on one or two commodities, and the fact that their debt is owed for the most part to governments of industrialized countries themselves or to international financial institutions.For those of the poorest countries that are undertaking adjustment effort, consideration should be given to the possibility of applying lower interest rates to their existing debt, and agreement should be reached, especially in the Paris Club, on longer repayment and grace periods to ease the debt service burden.We welcome the various proposals made in this area by some of us and also the proposal by the managing director of the I.M.F. for a significant increase in the resources of the Structural Adjustment Facility over the three years from Jan. 1, 1988.We urge a conclusion on discussions on these proposals within this year.28.We note that UNCTAD VII provides an opportunity for a discussion with developing countries with a view to arriving at a common perception of the major problems and policy issues in the world economy.  Environment29.Further to our previous commitment to preserve a healthy environment and to pass it on to future generations, we welcome the report by the environment experts on the improvement and harmonization of techniques and practices of environmental measurement.Accordingly, we encourage the United Nations Environment Program to institute a forum for information exchange and consultation in cooperation with the International Organization for Standardization and the International Council of Scientific Union, assisted by other interested international organizations and countries, so that continuing progress in this important field can be ensured.The priority environmental problems identified by the environment experts in their report should receive full attention.30.We underline our own responsibility to encourage efforts to tackle effectively environmental problems of worldwide impact such as stratospheric ozone depletion, climate change, acid rains, endangered species, hazardous substances, air and water pollution, and destruction of tropical forests.We also intend to examine further environmental issues such as stringent environmental standards as an incentive for innovation and for the development of clean, cost-effective and low-resource technology as well as promotion of internatikonal trade in low-pollution products, low-polluting industrial plants and other environmental protection technologies.31.We welcome the important progress achieved since Tokyo, particularly in the International Atomic Energy Agency, in enhancing effective international cooperation, with regard to safety in the management of nuclear energy. Other Issues32.We welcome the initiative of the Human Frontier Science Program presented by Japan, which is aimed at promoting, through international cooperation, basic research on biological functions.We are grateful for the informal opportunities our scientists have had to take part in some of the discussions of the feasibility study undertaken by Japan.We note that this study will be continued and we would be pleased to be kept informed about its progress.33.

Following is the official text of the economic declaration issued today at the end of the summit conference of the seven leading industrialized democracies: We, the heads of state or government of the seven major industrialized countries and the representatives of the European Community, have met in Venice from 8 to 10 June 1987, to review the progress that our countries have made, individually and collectively, in carrying out the policies to which we committed ourselves at earlier summits.We remain determined to pursue these policies for growth, stability, employment, and prosperity for our countries and for the world economy.We can look back on a number of positive developments since we met a year ago.Growth is continuing into its fifth consecutive year, albeit at lower rates.Average inflation rates have come down.Interest rates have generally declined.Changes have occurred in relationships among leading currencies which over time will contribute to a more sustainable pattern of current account positions and have brought exchange rates within ranges broadly consistent with economic fundamentals.In volume terms the adjustment of trade flows is under way, although in nominal terms imbalances so far remain too large. Macro-Economic Policies and Exchange Rates3.Since Tokyo, the summit countries have intensified their economic policy coordination with a view to insuring internal consistency of domestic policies and their international campatibility.This is essential to achieving stronger and sustained global growth, reduced external imbalances and more stable echange relationships.Given the policy agreements at the Louvre and in Washington, further susbstantial shifts in exchange rates could prove counterproductive to efforts to increase growth and facilitate adjustment.We reaffirm our commitment to the swift and the full implementation of those agreements.4.We now need to overcome the problems that nevertheless remain in some of our countries: external imbalances that are still large; persistently high unemployment; large public sector deficits; and high levels of real interest rates.There are also continuing trade restrictions and increased protectionist pressures, persistent weakness of many primary commodity markets, and reduced prospects for developing countries to grow, find the markets they need and service their foreign debt.5.The correction of external imbalances will be a long and difficult process.Exchange rate changes alone will not solve the problem of correcting these imbalances while sustaining growth.Surplus countries will design their policies to strengthen domestic demand and reduce external surpluses while maintaining price stability.Deficit countries, while following policies designed to encourage steady low-inflation growth, will reduce their fiscal and external imbalances.6.We call on other industrial countries to participate in the effort to sustain economic activity worldwide.We also call on newly industrialized economies with rapid growth and large external surpluses to assume greater responsibility for preserving an open world trading system by reducing trade barriers and pursuing policies that allow their currencies more fully to reflect underlying fundamentals.7.Among the summit countries, budgetary discipline remains an important medium-term objective and the reduction of existing public sector imbalances a necessity for a number of them.Those summit countries which have made significant progress in fiscal consolidation and have large external surpluses remain committed to following fiscal and monetary policies designed to strengthen domestic growth, within a framework of medium-term fiscal objectives.Monetary policy should also support noninflationary growth and foster stability of exchange rates.In view of the outlook for low inflation in many countries, a further market-led decline of interest rates would be helpful. Structural Policies8.We also agree on the need for effective structural policies especially for creating jobs.To this end we shall:  * Promote competition in order to speed up industrial adjustment;  * Reduce major imbalances between agricultural supply and demand;  * Facilitate job creating investment;  * Improve the functioning of labor markets;  * Promote the further opening of internal markets;  * Encourage the elimination of capital market imperfections and restrictions and the improvement of the functioning of international financial markets. Multilateral Surveillance and Policy Coordination9.We warmly welcome the progress achieved by the Group of Seven Finance Ministers in developing and implementing strengthened arrangements for multilateral surveillance and economic coordination as called for in Tokyo last year.The new process of coordination, involving the use of economic indicators, will enhance efforts to achieve more consistent and mutually compatible policies by our countries.10.The heads of state or government reaffirm the important policy commitments and undertakings adopted at the Louvre and Washington meetings of the Group of Seven, including those relating to exchange rates.They agree that, if in the future world economic growth is insufficient, additional actions will be required to achieve their common objectives.Accordingly, they call on their Finance Ministers to develop, if necessary, additional appropriate policy measures for this purpose and to continue to cooperate closely to foster stability of exchange rates.11.The coordination of economic policies is an ongoing process which will evolve and become more effective over time.The heads of state or government endorse the understandings reached by the Group of Seven Finance Ministers to strengthen, with the assistance of the International Monetary Fund, the surveillance of their economies using economic indicators including exchange rates, in particular by:  * The commitment by each country to develop medium-term objectives and projections for its economy, and for the group to develop objectives and projections, that are mutually consistent both individually and collectively; and  *The use of performance indicators to review and assess current economic trends and to determine whether there are significant deviations for an intended course that require consideration of remedial actions.12.The heads of state or government consider these measures important steps toward promoting sustained noninflationary global growth and greater currency stability.They call upon the Group of Seven Finance Ministers and central bank governors to:  * Intensify their coordination efforts with a view to achieving prompt and effective implementation of the agreed policy undertakings and commitments;  * Monitor economic developments closely in cooperation with the managing director of the I.M.F.; and  * Consider further improvements as appropriate to make the coordination process more effective. Trade13.We note rising protectionist pressures with grave concern.The Uruguay Round can play an important role in maintaining and strengthening the multilateral trading system, and achieving increased liberalization of trade for the benefit of all countries.Recognizing the interrelationship among growth, trade and development, it is essential to improve the multilateral system based on the principles and rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and bring about a wider coverage of world trade under agreed, effective and enforceable multilateral discipline.Protectionist actions would be counterproductive, would increase the risk of further exchange rate instability and would exacerbate the problems of development and indebtedness.14.We endorse fully the commitment to adopt appropriate measures in compliance with the principles of stand-still and rollback which have been reaffirmed in the Ministerial Declaration on the Uruguay Round.It is important to establish in the GATT a multilateral framework of principles and rules for trade in services, trade-related investment measures and intellectual property rights.This extension of the multilateral trading system would also be beneficial to developing countries in fostering growth and enhancing trade, investment and technology transfers.15.Basing ourselves on the ministerial declaration on the Uruguay Round and on the principles of the GATT, we call on all contracting parties to negotiate comprehensively, in good faith and with all due despatch, with a view to ensuring mutual advantage and increased benefits to all participants.Canada, Japan, the United States and the European Community will table a wide range of substantive proposals in Geneva over the coming months.Progress in the Uruguay Round will be kept under close political review.In this context the launching, the conduct and the implementation of the outcome of the negotiations should be treated as parts of a single undertaking; however, agreements reached at an early stage might be implemented on a provisional or a definitive basis by agreement prior to the formal conclusion of the negotiations, and should be taken into account in assessing the overall balance of the negotiations.16.A strong, credible, working GATT is essential to the well-being of all trading countries and is the best bulwark against mounting bilateral protectionist pressures.The functioning of the GATT should be improved through ensuring better coordination between the GATT and the IMF and the World Bank.We consider that it would be useful to have, as appropriate, in the course of the negotiations, a meeting of the Trade Negotiating Committee at the Ministerial level.  Agriculture17.At Tokyo we recognized the serious nature of the agricultural problem.We agreed that the structure of agricultural production needed to be adjusted in the light of world demand, and expressed our determination to give full support to the work of the O.E.C.D. in this field.In doing so, we all recognized the importance of agriculture to the well-being of our rural communities.In the past year, we have actively pursued the approach outlined at Tokyo, and we take satisfaction from the agreement in the Ministerial Declaration adopted in Punta del Este on the objectives for the negotiations on agriculture in the Uruguay Round.18.We reaffirm our commitment to the important agreement on agriculture set out in the O.E.C.D. ministerial communique of May 13, 1987; in particular, the statement of the scope and urgency of the problem which require that a concerted reform of agricultural policies be implemented in a balanced and flexible manner; the assessment of the grave implications, for developed and developing countries alike, of the growing imbalances in supply of the demand for the main agricultural products; the acknowledgment of shared responsibility for the problems as well as for their equitable, effective and durable resolution; the principles of reform and the action required.The long-term objective is to allow market signals to influence the orientation of agricultural production, by way of a progressive and concerted reduction of agricultural support, as well as by all other appropriate means, giving consideration to social and other concerns, such as food security, environmental protection and overall employment.19.We underscore our commitment to work in concert to achieve the necessary adjustments of agricultural policies, both at home and through comprehensive negotiations in the Uruguay Round.In this as in other fields, we will table comprehensive proposals for negotiations in the coming months to be conducted in accordance with the mandate in the Ministerial Declaration, and we intend to review at our next meeting the progress achieved and the tasks that remain.20.In the meantime, in order to create a climate of greater confidence which would enhance the prospect for rapid progress in the Uruguay Round as a whole and as a step towards the longterm result to be expected from those negotiations, we have agreed, and call upon other countgries to agree, to refrain from actions which, by further stimulating production of agricultural commodities in surplus, increasing protection or destabilizing world markets, would worsen the negotiating climate and, more generally, damage trade relations. Developing Countries and Debt21.We attach particular importance to fostering stable economic progress in developing countries, with all their diverse situations and needs.The problems of many heavily indebted developing countries are a cause of economic and political concern and can be a threat to political stability in countries with democratic regimes.We salute the courageous efforts of many of these countries to achieve economic growth and stability.22.We underline the continuing importance of official development assistance and welcome the increased efforts of some of our countries in this respect.We recall the target already established by international organizations (0.7 percent) for the future level of official development assistance and we take note that overall financial flows are important to development.We strongly support the activities of international financial institutions, including those regional development banks which foster policy reforms by borrowers and finance their programs of structural adjustment.In particular:  *We support the central role of the I.M.F. through its advice and financing and encourage closer cooperation between the I.M.F. and the World Bank, especially in their structural adjustment lending;  * We note with satisfaction the contribution made by the eighth replenishment of the International Development Association;  * We support a general capital increase of the World Bank when justified by increased demand for quality lending, by its expanded role in the debt strategy and by the necessity to maintain the financial stability of the institution;  * In the light of the different contributions of our countries to official development assistance, we welcome the recent initiative of the Japanese Government in bringing forward a new scheme which will increase the provision of resources from Japan to developing countries.23.For the major middle-income debtors, we continue to support the present growth-oriented case-by-case strategy.Three elements are needed to strengthen the growth prospects of debtor countries: the adoption of comprehensive macroeconomic and structural reforms by debtor countries themselves; the enhancement of lending by international financial institutions, in particular the World Bank; and adequate commercial bank lending in support of debtor country reforms.We shall play our part by helping to sustain growth and expand trade.A number of debt agreements have allowed some resumption of growth, correction of imbalances, and significant progress in restoring the creditworthiness of some countries.But some still lack adequate policies for structural adjustment and growth designed to encourage the efficient use of domestic savings, the repatriation of flight capital, increased flows of foreign direct investment, and in particular reforms of financial markets.24.There is equally a need for timely and effective mobilization of lending by commercial banks.In this context, we support efforts by commercial banks and debtor countries to develop a ''menu'' of alternative negotiating procedures and financing techniques for providing continuing support to debtor countries.25.Measures should be taken, particularly by debtor countries, to facilitate non-debt-creating capital flows, especially direct investment.In this connection, the Multilateral Investment Guarantees Agency should begin to serve its objectives as soon as possible.It is important to maintain flexibility on the part of export credit agencies in promptly resuming or increasing cover for countries that are implementing comprehensive adjustment programs.26.We recognize the problems of developing countries whose economies are solely or predominantly dependent on exports of primary commodities the prices of which are persistently depressed.It is important that the functioning of commodity markets should be improved, for example through better information and greater transparency.Further diversification of these economies should be encouraged, with the help of the international financial institutions, through policies to support their efforts for improved processing of their products, to expand opportunities through market access liberalization, and to strengthen the international environment for structural change.27.We recognize that the problems of some of the poorest countries, primarily in the sub-Saharan Africa, are uniquely difficult and need special treatment.These countries are characterized by such features as acute poverty, limited resources to invest in their own development, unmanageable debt burdens, heavy reliance on one or two commodities, and the fact that their debt is owed for the most part to governments of industrialized countries themselves or to international financial institutions.For those of the poorest countries that are undertaking adjustment effort, consideration should be given to the possibility of applying lower interest rates to their existing debt, and agreement should be reached, especially in the Paris Club, on longer repayment and grace periods to ease the debt service burden.We welcome the various proposals made in this area by some of us and also the proposal by the managing director of the I.M.F. for a significant increase in the resources of the Structural Adjustment Facility over the three years from Jan. 1, 1988.We urge a conclusion on discussions on these proposals within this year.28.We note that UNCTAD VII provides an opportunity for a discussion with developing countries with a view to arriving at a common perception of the major problems and policy issues in the world economy.  Environment29.Further to our previous commitment to preserve a healthy environment and to pass it on to future generations, we welcome the report by the environment experts on the improvement and harmonization of techniques and practices of environmental measurement.Accordingly, we encourage the United Nations Environment Program to institute a forum for information exchange and consultation in cooperation with the International Organization for Standardization and the International Council of Scientific Union, assisted by other interested international organizations and countries, so that continuing progress in this important field can be ensured.The priority environmental problems identified by the environment experts in their report should receive full attention.30.We underline our own responsibility to encourage efforts to tackle effectively environmental problems of worldwide impact such as stratospheric ozone depletion, climate change, acid rains, endangered species, hazardous substances, air and water pollution, and destruction of tropical forests.We also intend to examine further environmental issues such as stringent environmental standards as an incentive for innovation and for the development of clean, cost-effective and low-resource technology as well as promotion of internatikonal trade in low-pollution products, low-polluting industrial plants and other environmental protection technologies.31.We welcome the important progress achieved since Tokyo, particularly in the International Atomic Energy Agency, in enhancing effective international cooperation, with regard to safety in the management of nuclear energy. Other Issues32.We welcome the initiative of the Human Frontier Science Program presented by Japan, which is aimed at promoting, through international cooperation, basic research on biological functions.We are grateful for the informal opportunities our scientists have had to take part in some of the discussions of the feasibility study undertaken by Japan.We note that this study will be continued and we would be pleased to be kept informed about its progress.33.We welcome the positive contribution made by the Conference of High Level Experts on the future role of education in our society, held in Kyoto in January 1987.34.We shall continue to review the ethical implications of developments in the life sciences.Following the conferences sponsored by summit governments - by Japan in 1984, by France in 1985, by the Federal Republic of Germany in 1986 and by Canada in 1987 - we welcome the Italian Government's offer to host the next bioethics Conference in Italy in April 1988. Next Economic Summit35.We have agreed to meet again next year and have accepted the invitation of the Canadian Prime Minister to meet in Canada.

Japan and the United States is dependable, according to an opinion survey in late November by The New York Times, CBS News and the Tokyo Broadcasting System.Japan and the United States are struggling to prevent their successful alliance from being engulfed by a rising tide of frustrations, resentments and recriminations.Solid majorities of both countries say they feel that relations between them are friendly and that the alliance between Japan and the United States is dependable, according to an opinion survey in late November by The New York Times, CBS News and the Tokyo Broadcasting System.But reflecting the strains in their official relations, the poll shows that Americans voice a deeply pessimistic view about competing with Japan and that the Japanese increasingly see Americans as living in a nation in decline and inclined to blame Japan for its own economic problems. [ Page A16. ]The war in the Persian Gulf and the collapse of Communism are forcing Tokyo and Washington to redefine their relationship -- especially the tradition of Washington providing security and foreign policy guidelines while Japan tended to business.It has proved difficult to rally the Japanese and Americans to new kinds of cooperation -- to defend democracy, combat poverty, help the environment and other activities consistent with President Bush's new world order -- particularly because of emotions unleashed by the gulf war."The gulf war was a trigger to submerged feelings in Japan," said Terumasa Nakanishi, professor of international relations at Shizuoka University."The Japanese were exposed to a typically American self-righteous justification of resorting to war.It helped convince Japanese that they are culturally different."For many Japanese and Americans, this is a time of reflection on their relationship.While the 50th anniversary of Pearl Harbor brings reminders of the unpleasant past, the visit of President Bush in January to meet the newly elected Prime Minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, is turning everyone's attention to current problems.The current strains are exacerbated by what Japanese see as the spectacle of a once all-powerful United States struggling with debt, deficits, weak financial institu- tions, and mounting social problems, making them wonder about America's ability to maintain its world leadership.Leaders of both the United States and Japan, which together account for 40 percent of the world's economic output and 40 percent of aid to poor countries, defend their record and say cooperation is better than is often perceived."The basic trend is very satisfactory," said Koichiro Matsuura, director general of the North American bureau at the Foreign Ministry."Nobody can disagree that the ties between Japan and the United States have become much better.It's the perceptions that have deteriorated."But other recent events -- particularly the American decision to withdraw 15,000 of the 135,000 troops stationed in Japan, South Korea and the Philippines -- have made Japanese leaders nervous about the future reliability of the United States.The United States' recent failure to win agreement in the Philippines for renewal of American bases there, which has accelerated the pullout from Asia, has shaken Japan.Indeed, Tokyo agreed to give the Philippines $1 billion in aid at the Americans' urging, hoping to persuade Manila to keep American troops. Fear of Creating A Power VacuumNow there is widespread nervousness in Japan and Asia that an American withdrawal could leave a vacuum and stimulate an arms race among Asian nations.Asians are nervous that Japan is slightly modifying its long-held pacifism and preparing to send troops abroad for the first time since World War II, as part of United Nations peacekeeping forces."A power vacuum in Asia is something we must prevent," said Makoto Sakuma, chairman of the joint staff council of the Defense Agency."If the American military presence in Asia is withdrawn, not only Japan but Asia as a whole will suffer instability."Because of American economic weakness, Washington has put pressure on Tokyo to increase its share of the burden of 56,000 troops in Japan.Japan now pays about half the cost, or about $3 billion a year, to support the American naval and ground forces, making it cheaper to station troops in Japan than in the United States.The problem is that after the collapse of Communism, Japan and the United States may no longer see eye to eye on security.As The Times/CBS News/Tokyo Broadcasting System poll showed, many Japanese opposed the gulf war and generally are more opposed than Americans to using American military force in the world.This contradiction could become a crisis in a future conflict requiring American troops based in Japan."Americans would be wise to abandon the term 'burden sharing' because it both reeks of American self-righteousness and amounts to a self-advertisement of America's declining ability to carry out an independent foreign policy," Chalmers Johnson, Rohr professor of Pacific international relations at the University of California at San Diego, wrote recently.Moreover, many Japanese feel that the concentration of 29,000 marines in Okinawa cannot last.The new governor of that island has for the first time demanded an American withdrawal, a step that would eliminate a base from which the first marines traveled to the gulf last year.At the heart of the Japanese-American relationship have been efforts on myriad fronts to reduce the trade deficit, which has in fact fallen in recent years.But all the negotiations, even those that have yielded results, have taken their toll in a subtle way."The Japanese find it hard to make concessions, only to be faced with new demands," said Michael C. Armacost, the United States Ambassador, in explaining the Japanese inflexibiity."We find it frustrating to have to demand that Japan market access that we extend in our own country.I wish there was another way of doing these things."American leaders are nettled by the refusal of Japan to lift its ban on rice imports or take other steps to break the deadlock in the current Uruguay Round of trade talks.In Washington's view, Tokyo is not protecting and defending the world trading system from which it benefits more than any other nation.The United States trade deficit with Japan has narrowed to $41 billion last year from a peak of $56 billion in 1987, and there have been agreements on supercomputers, semiconductors, construction contracts and many other sectors.Japan's imports from the United States have doubled in five years.But both sides agree that the long-term trends are disturbing.The deficit is bound to go back up as the United States recovers from its recession and the demand for imports surges.Japan is also exporting more to the United States indirectly, from factories in other parts of Asia and is commanding a larger share of the American market through goods produced in its own American factories, too.Moreover, Japan has spent five years mobilizing its resources -- investing two and a half times as much as the United States in new plants, equipment and research -- to produce new products.While Japan has prepared in this fashion, the United States has begun lodging more fundamental criticisms of Japan's cozy business relationships, and its whole policy of submerging consumer interests to those of business, the very things that Japanese feel have been secrets to their success.An Outpouring By Critics in JapanJapan has responded with an outpouring of critical comments among scholars, businessmen and politicians, many disdainful of the United States, suggesting that the United States is blaming Japan for its problems.One economist, Seiichiro Saito, a professor at Rikkyo University, said that the United States was becoming a "vegetable nation" suffering from a kind of degenerative disease which makes it unconscious of its problems and able only to demand to borrow money from Japan and other countries.Japanese do not like to express their feelings openly, but it is almost impossible to speak with anyone in a position of responsibility and not pick up an undercurrent of criticism, friendly and not so friendly."The whole U.S. society seems to be deteriorating," a senior Japanese diplomat said."Americans are losing their ability to communicate among themselves.Everyone is either fighting or hiring lawyers, and America's ability to integrate different elements into a melting pot is weakening.So Americans are looking for scapegoats and blaming Japan."Many diplomats and negotiators also feel that having tried to resolve their differences on a number of trade issues, they are down to the fact that Japanese and Americans are simply different culturally, and that America should stop lecturing Japan to change."Americans ought to learn to respect the differences among people who live outside the United States," said Kazuo Ogura, director of cultural affairs at the Foreign Ministry."Americans simply don't want to recognize that Japan has won the economic race against the West."Japaneseand Americans agree that in the environment after the cold war, where both countries no longer fear a Soviet military threat, the staggering economic interdependence of Japan and the United States is the glue that binds the two nations together.Japan now has an estimated $83 billion in direct American investments, although the rate of growth dropped sharply in the last year.But Japanese-owned factories and other interests employ many Americans and have become a crucial part of the economy.Meanwhile, Japan counts on American markets for a third of its global exports, and Tokyo carefully monitors every bill in Congress that would restrict the flow.Japanese officials, knowing that President Bush has opposed such measures, mask some of their disappointments with his Administration.His support will be critical as it carves out a broader role in world affairs.It is seeking upgraded status at the Interntional Monetary Fund and permanent membership in the United Nations Security Council.It also wants removal of clauses in the United Nations charter referring to Japan as a former enemy state.American support for these steps is seen in Japan as lukewarm.Japan and the United States maintain that they have achieved impressive cooperation in the areas of foreign aid, environment, narcotics, refugees and debt relief for developing nations.But the record is mixed.Japan this year doubled its contribution to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, for example, and for the first time a Japanese, Sadako Ogata, a respected scholar on international relations, has been chosen to that agency or indeed any other international agency.But on foreign aid to poor countries, Japan has been struggling to fulfill its promises to provide help commensurate with its status as an economic superpower.In 1989, Japan achieved the position of the largest donor of foreign aid in the world, but in 1990 the United States regained the title.International organizations want Japan to do more because it spends only 1 percent of its gross national product on its military, as opposed to 6 percent by the United States.Many have asked Japan raise its foreign aid spending also to 1 percent, but it has remained at less than four-tenths of 1 percent, making it only the eighth biggest giver in terms of economic capacity.The Japanese Way Of Giving Out AidThe way Japan has given out aid has also remained controversial.Tokyo continues emphasize big industrial projects that help its own companies.After war broke out in the gulf, for instance, Japan announced a $2 billion economic package for the region, largely for projects like the Beniseuf cement factory in Egypt, being built by the Mitsubishi Corporation and Kobe Steel, and the Golden Horn Bridge in Turkey, being built by IHI, a Japanese construction company.Nor has Japan succeeded in developing a consistent philosophy for its foreign aid program.Last year, Tokyo announced that it would not give aid to countries that exported weapons, and would use its aid to promote democracy and human rights.But Japan has persisted in giving aid to China, a leading arms exporter, and has refused to cut off aid to Burma."Japan lacks a focus on what it is actually trying to achieve with its foreign aid," said Robert M. Orr, director of the Kyoto Center for Japanese Studies, and author of the book "The Emergence of Japan's Foreign Aid Power."He added, "It doesn't fit into any coherent world vision."In the environmental area, the global partnership appears mostly to be a slogan masking continuing disagreements on matters like global warming, destruction of tropical forests by Japanese companies and protection of endangered species.All the difficulties and differences of perspective between Japan and the United States have caused some to predict much greater conflict ahead, especially who fear Japanese intentions over the long term, although they concede that the alliance is strong for now.Professor Johnson, at the University of California at San Diego, has warned that Japan's American investments amount to an attempt to colonize the United States, that Japan could move away from Washington's orbit and try to create a a yen-based regional trading bloc."In the case of Japan," he wrote recently, "past behavior and current capabilities are so extraordinary and so formidable as to cause any other nation or people to be concerned about its future intentions."Such talk is dismissed by most Americans and Japanese.Those Japanese who argue that Japan should indeed assert its interests, even if they are antithetical to those of the United States, take the most pains to tell Americans that they should not worry that there are conflicts."Japan has learned the lessons of war, and we are determined never to go beyond these four islands anywhere in the world," said Jun Eto, a conservative-oriented visiting professor at Keio University."But the United States and Japan will have to learn to live with constant conflict.We are both competitive, jealous and powerful nations, after all.""Conflict doesn't mean war," he added."The greatest lesson of World War II, is that we in Japan have to live with Americans whether we like it or not.But I don't know whether that's a lesson learned in America."--------------------NEXT:A decade of difficult trade talks leaves both sides unsatisfied.

IT was a crisp, golden day in the vast forests here, near the base of Mount Fuji, but for  
<<Shigejiro Sugiyama>>
   
//a  stroll in the country was an encounter with an  disaster.//
He plucked a sprig of cedar and pointed out how the trees were heavy with dense rows of tiny amber buds, the product of a particularly hot, dry summer.They meant that come spring, he and millions of other Japanese are likely to suffer in what experts are saying will be the worst year ever for a malady known in no other country to such a degree: allergic reactions to cedar pollen.But for  
<<Mr. Sugiyama>>
   
//the  real disaster was in the fact that this health problem was caused by what many here describe as short-sighted Government policies,  nature.//
The forests in this mountainous region were once verdant swaths of oak, maple and numerous other kinds of broadleaf trees and evergreens.But after World War II, Government bureaucrats applied their aggressive industrial policies to the environment as well as the economy.In the process, they financed the replacement of what they saw as commercially useless natural forests with more economically productive trees.For the most part, this extraordinary experiment in environmental engineering has involved planting a single species, the Japanese cedar, because of the usefulness of its wood and the speed of its growth.As a result, Japan now has the largest tracts of cedar on earth, with this scenic region around Mount Fuji, long regarded as a symbol of the nation, among the most densely planted.The aim was to make the country self-sufficient in wood products, but the widespread sensitivities to cedar pollen are just one indication of how this single-minded strategy has gone awry.It is becoming increasingly apparent, experts say, that the superabundance of a single species of tree is threatening wildlife, causing heavy soil erosion, reducing the water table and creating the potential for disastrous landslides.Even in economic terms, the strategy has failed.There is a growing volume of domestic cedar available --  
<<Mr. Sugiyama>>
  s stroll here took him past  
//loggers  chopping and stacking the nearly identically  trees//
 -- but  
//it  is being overwhelmed by imports of inexpensive timber, mostly from the rapidly dwindling forests of  Asia.//
That has put cedar prices into a 13-year decline and sharply reduced the proportion of Japan's annual wood supply the country grows itself, from 80 percent three decades ago to 26 percent now.The cases of pollenosis, as the reactions to the cedar pollen are known, are a product of the unprecedented concentration of mature cedars; it is believed that never before have humans been assaulted by such huge waves of pollen.

Mr. Sugiyama, a lawyer, was prompted to act when he first suffered attacks of sneezing and wheezing two years ago.He has become the first person to sue the Government to force it to change its reforestation policies."When I started suffering, it got so bad I wanted to scratch out my eyes," said Mr. Sugiyama, whose name means cedar mountain."I finally  
//realized  that this was a result of the Government s misguided  policy//
 and that

 "With 1 in 10 Japanese affected, the allergies have become a national obsession.By late February, one of the most closely watched items in the news every day is a running count of the cedar pollen in the air.Tokyo has two big electronic billboards on which it flashes the figures, and the city runs allergy hot lines."At the peak, you can actually see a pollen fog coming from the cedar forests," said Dr. Yozo Saito, an allergy specialist at Tokyo Medical and Dental University and head of a commission on the problem for the Tokyo metropolitan government."It is so bad that when people first began to notice this a decade or so ago they thought there were forest fires."The reforestation policy represents a side of Japan's industrial policy little known outside the country, but obvious to anyone who has explored the countryside.In many parts of Japan, beautiful natural scenery has been transformed into monotonous tableaus of a uniform dark green.The miles of tall, slender cedars, straight as telephone poles, make up nearly 20 percent of Japan's forests, or more than 10 million acres.The policy illustrates the surprisingly manipulative view the Government has taken of the environment, in spite of the revered place mountains, forests, streams and lakes hold in traditional Japanese culture.For example, all but two of the country's rivers have been dammed or diverted, or directed into concrete embankments.The number of lakes and wetlands still in their natural state, already tiny, has declined to only 210 from 233 in the mid-1980's, according to the Government, with the remainder in some way built up.But the reforestation strategy, driven by subsidies that cover about half the cost of replanting, was perhaps the grandest attempt to make the environment a cog in the country's industrial strategy.There are 62.3 million acres of forest in Japan, covering two-thirds of the country's mountainous land area.But 41 percent of the forests have been artificially planted, and 44 percent of the reforested area is planted with cedar, formally known as Cryptomeria japonica."The reforestation policy was a failure," said Tsunahide Shitei, the former president of Kyoto Prefectural University and one of Japan's leading forestry experts."During the high-growth years of the economy, the Forestry Agency was dragged into this fast-growth atmosphere and focused only on commercial concerns.They should have planted broadleaf trees as well."They completely ignored the fact that a forest involves considerations other than business.A tree does not exist just for economic gain."Taishitiroo 
<<Satoo,>>
  a forestry expert who has retired from Tokyo University and is now president of the Japan Wildlife Research Center, said: "Fortunately,  
//there  have been no great disasters, like we had with Minamata disease, but the problem is  serious.//
This policy is destroying biodiversity."He was referring to Japan's most notorious industrial pollution disaster.Several decades ago, the dumping of mercury and other heavy-metal compounds into Minamata Bay in western Japan caused an outbreak of health disorders that left hundreds dead and thousands more injured.The Government responded to some industrial pollution problems with stringent environmental safeguards.Japan now produces, for instance, less than half as much carbon dioxide per person as the United States.But  
<<Yoichi Kaya>>
  an engineering professor at Tokyo University and a Government adviser on technology and environmental issues, said the fundamental problem is that  
//the  economic calculus driving industrial policy here treats the environment and public health as  afterthought.//
The Government has a huge apparatus for developing competitive industries but  
<<Mr. Kaya>>
  complained,  
//"there  is no effective mechanism for assessing new technologies and their environmental impact before they are put in place, or for formulating policies that can deal with  questions.//
"Forestry Agency officials say the tree-planting policy was necessary because the natural forests were devastated during and immediately after World War II for use as fuel and in building.But the officials concede the policy may have gone too far.

 He admitted that in addition to the allergy problems, the monoculture forests have harmed wildlife and increased the likelihood of natural disasters. 
//"Natural  forests are less efficient,  speaking,"//
  
<<Mr. Oonishi>>
 "But the artificial forests have not been well taken care of.They need a lot of maintenance, such as trimming the branches that produce the pollen."The Japanese cedar, or sugi, has been here for tens of thousands of years, but it was only after the intensive planting began that the allergic reactions emerged.Yoshinobu Naruse, who is working with Mr. Sugiyama on the problem, has lived on the edge of this forest for decades, but only succumbed to the allergies a few years ago, as many of the nearby trees matured.While the extraordinary abundance of cedar pollen is generally agreed to be the main cause of the allergic reactions, many experts believe air pollution, particularly diesel exhaust, worsens the malady, and that changing diets may be a factor.In their natural state, the cedars grow into towering giants.The wood has a clear, smooth grain, gives off a pleasant woodsy scent and is resistant to many insects.It has been used for centuries in home building.When they are planted, the trees grow swiftly but completely change the character of the forest, experts say, preventing sunlight from reaching the forest floor and offering little food or protection for animals.Because they have shallow roots, they hold less water in the earth and can be felled easily by storms and landslides.The Forestry Agency has few ideas and even less money with which to tackle the problem.The years of subsidies have left the agency about $30 billion in debt. 
//"They  say they've been trying to come up with some new strain of cedar, but it takes at least 20 years for these trees  mature,"//

Marshall Schalk, a geologist known for his studies of the Arctic shoreline of Alaska, died on Tuesday at Cooley Dickenson Hospital in Northampton, Mass.Dr. Schalk, who lived in Northampton, was 87.The cause was a heart attack, said a spokeswoman for Smith College, where he was professor emeritus of geology.He was hospitalized with pneumonia on Monday.Dr. Schalk, who remained an active member of the college community to his death, explored shoreline and beach changes in Arctic Alaska in the 1950's and 60's, making his base at the Naval Arctic Research Laboratory in Point Barrow.Born in Boston, he graduated from Harvard College and went on to receive his master's and doctorate degrees in geology from Harvard University.For several years, he also worked for private industry in Mexico, Texas and Pennsylvania exploring for copper and petroleum.His interest in shoreline changes and submarine topography dated to the 1930's and 1940's, when he worked at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and on Eleuthera, in the Bahamas.In 1941 he was hired as an assistant professor at Smith, where he had previously been an assistant in geology.He advanced to full professor in 1970, after serving two stints as department chairman for a total of nine years.

To the Editor:''Malaria Makes a Comeback, and Is More Deadly Than Ever'' (front page, Jan. 8) captures the multiple factors -- population movements, chemical resistance, lapsed public health vigilance and environmental change -- influencing the resurgence of malaria.Mosquitoes, the transmitters of the disease, are indeed quintessential opportunists and adapt readily in disturbed environments.As co-author of the World Health Organization report discussed in your article, I offer several recent findings.Consistent with model projections that global warming could hasten the geographic spread of malaria and dengue fever, these devastating diseases are now occurring at high altitudes in Latin America, central Africa and Asia.Cerebral malaria has occurred in Nairobi, Kenya, while dengue fever is found in the mountains around San Jose, Costa Rica.Moreover, highland malaria and dengue fever are occurring in the context of upward migration of plants on many continents and summit glacial retreat in Latin America, Europe, central Africa and Asia.A recent study in  
<<the journal Nature>>
  confirmed that  
//the  freezing levels in the mountains have indeed shifted upward about 500 feet since 1970, representing a warming of close to 2  Fahrenheit.//
As we enter a year of debate concerning climate change (the convention will be held in Kyoto, Japan, in  December), it is prudent to examine the potential consequences associated with continued warming and climate instability.Your article says that malaria ''hinders economic development''; epidemics are growing ever more costly in terms of health, development, trade and tourism.While the resurgence of infectious disease has multiple social, biological and environmental roots, meteorological factors may play an increasing role in the future.We may be vastly underestimating the social and economic damages associated with epidemics and extreme weather events as well as the potential benefits to society as a whole of changing our environmental and energy policies.PAUL R. EPSTEIN, M.D.  Boston, Jan. 8, 1997  The writer is associate director of the Center for Health and the Global Environment at Harvard Medical School.
Article no :6
STERNLY worded petitions and ringing screeds of principle are as much a part of campus life as grade inflation -- which is why Washington rarely takes them seriously.But the nation's movers and shakers would do well to pay attention to a statement on global warming by some 2,000 mostly academic economists.For one thing, the signatures collected by Redefining Progress, a group of policy-minded social scientists based in San Francisco, range from the newish left (Duncan Foley of Barnard College) to the skeptical center (James Heckman of the University of Chicago) to the libertarian right (Gordon Tullock of the University of Arizona). '' 
//Market-based  approaches to coping with climate change generate as much consensus among economists as  trade,''//
 explains  
<<Paul Krugman>>
 More important, the statement focuses on what is now regarded by insiders as a make-it-or-break-it issue in slowing atmospheric warming: designing an international system that permits rich economies to contribute cash in lieu of emissions reductions. '' 
//Allowing  some to pay others to reduce greenhouse emissions could reduce the total cost by 80 to  percent,''//
 estimates  
<<William Nordhaus>>
 Like any committee looking for consensus, the drafters of the climate statement cast their net widely. ''We believe that global climate change carries with it significant environmental, economic, social and geopolitical risks, and that preventive steps are justified,'' the unshocking introduction reads.Those who read on, however, will discover there is meat on these bones: ''Sound economic analysis,'' the authors argue, ''shows that there are policy options that would slow climate change without harming American living standards.''And what might these policy options be?Here, the drafters stake out a position that seems almost obvious to economists, but has barely entered the consciousness of environmental policy makers. ''A cooperative approach among nations is required -- such as an international emissions trading agreement,'' the statement asserts.To understand where the economists really want the diplomats to go, consider where we are now.Current rates of deforestation and combustion of carbon-based fuels -- coal, oil, gas -- are adding carbon dioxide into the atmosphere faster than the oceans can absorb it.The higher carbon dioxide concentrations trap solar energy.Rising temperatures will likely change weather patterns radically and raise the level of the oceans.Governments of all the major economies are vaguely committed to containing greenhouse gas emissions before once-a-century hurricanes become an annual event in the Caribbean, Kansas turns into a dust bowl and the Bay of Bengal doubles in size at the expense of Bangladesh.But the emphasis is on the vague: the process of setting emissions targets or creating political institutions to enforce the targets is in the talking stage.That's where the economists' statement fits in. '' 
//We  wanted to be  early,''//
 said  
<<Stephen DeCanio>>
  of the University of California at Santa Barbara,  
//''before  governments and politicians were locked  positions.''//
Specifically, the statement is intended to give the Clinton Administration some help in pressing the idea of creating an international market in emissions permits at the next global meeting on climate change, set for Kyoto, Japan, in December.The idea is simple.If and when world leaders start to deal with the practical issues, they are apt to set national targets for containing emissions that will be very expensive to meet in the rich industrial economies, and probably won't be honored in the large emerging economies like China, Russia, India and Indonesia.Creating an emissions trading system that allows already rich economies to pay the emerging economies to use less energy and less carbon-intensive fuels as they develop offers a double dividend.It reduces the cost for developed countries, in turn reducing the chances their legislatures will balk.And it creates a pool of capital to be used as an incentive to push emerging economies toward environmentally benign growth.Translation: Getting, say, China or India to switch from coal to natural gas, or to encourage energy conservation by charging world market prices at home would be a lot easier if they were paid billions of dollars each year to do it.Not every economist who favors emissions trading signed the statement. '' 
//I'm  worried it will be used at Kyoto to commit America to useless, expensive unilateral actions in  emissions,''//
 says  
<<Robert Hahn>>
 But Mr. Nordhaus has very different worries. ''Economists haven't been important players in environmental policy over the last 30 years,'' he said. ''This time we could make a difference.''Economic Scene

Bookkeeping gimmicks employed to simulate big reductions.Promises of a decisive decrease, but not until somebody else is in office.Borrowing against future generations.Sound like the old Reagan-era budget schemes?Actually, these statements describe  
<<the Clinton Administration's>>
  plan for  
//curbing  emissions of gases that may cause the  effect.//
Not only is  
<<the Administration>>
  surprisingly irresolute on  
//reducing  emissions of carbon dioxide and  gases,//
 but it is also missing a golden opportunity to  
//advocate  a reform that would help the environment and increase  efficiency://
  
//a  tax on the burning of fossil fuels that would be offset by cuts in other  taxes.//
A treaty signed by more than 150 countries in 1992 in Rio de Janiero committed them to reducing emissions that may cause artificial global warming.Two international summits in Kyoto, Japan, later this year will supposedly bring the agreement into force.But many countries hope to wriggle out of their commitments, and the United States is doing some of the most uninhibited wriggling.In its proposal, recently submitted to the United Nations  
<<the Administration>>
  has set  
//laudable  long-term goals for reducing  emissions.//
The catch is that the plan would not have teeth until 2010 -- long after President Clinton has left office (even a two-term Gore Presidency could have ended).For public relations purposes, the Administration is insisting that its proposal is ''binding.''But the plan is backed up by little more than an honor system.It is as if  
<<the White House>>
  said there will be  
//a  ''binding'' law against speeding, but that no tickets would be issued  2010.//
 
<<The Clinton>>
  proposal would even  
//allow  governments to appear to be making greenhouse progress by ''borrowing'' credits from  years//
 --  
//claiming  a decrease today through nothing more than a pledge to cut emissions in the  future.//
During the 1992 Presidential campaign,  
<<Al Gore>>
  repeatedly  
//excoriated  President George Bush for failing to support binding reductions in greenhouse gases  2000.//
Now, apparently not wanting to upset industry,  
<<the Administration>>
  says that  
//short-term  greenhouse gas reductions would unnecessarily  manufacturers.//
It has defined ''short term'' as anything before the year 2010.If  
<<Vice President Gore>>
  really believed, as he once said, that  
//the  possibility of global warming is ''the worst crisis our country has  faced,''//
The Administration plan does have a couple of good initiatives among its weaknesses.One is that companies would, as an alternative to cutting their own emissions, be able to buy greenhouse gas ''credits'' from other factories that cut their emissions to even lower levels than required.The model for this plan is a 1990 law that allows the trading of permits for emissions that produce acid rain.This has helped cut acid rain faster than expected and at about one-tenth the cost projected by the Bush Administration. 
<<The White House>>
  plan would also  
//allow  corporations to gain credits for greenhouse gas emissions by helping to reduce pollution in fast-growing countries  China.//
American companies could then forgo expensive renovations of their relatively efficient factories in the United States by, say,  paying for the modernization of hugely inefficient Chinese power plants.This would help cut overall global emissions while sending Western money and technology to other countries.Still,  
<<the Clinton>>
  plan overlooks a far more effective incentive to reduce greenhouse gases:  
//imposing  a tax on the burning of  fuels.//
At the same time, other corporate taxes could be reduced.You can be a skeptic about whether dangerous global warming has been proved -- I certainly am -- and still support these carbon taxes.Moderate taxes on the greenhouse emissions of power plants, factories and automobiles would create an incentive for improved energy efficiency, which is in the national interest regardless of whether the global temperature is rising, falling or doing nothing at all.A 1992  
<<Bush Administration>>
  study found that  
//greenhouse  gases could be cut by up to 11 percent with no cost to the economy, considering the value of  savings.//
A levy on the consumption of fossil fuels is attractive because it shifts the tax burden toward pollution, a negative, and away from capital and labor, which are positives.That is why more than 2,000 economists from across the political spectrum, including six Nobel laureates, signed a statement last month calling for carbon taxes as part of a system of tradeable permits for greenhouse emissions.Carbon taxes would reward the efficient use of natural resources and cut greenhouse gas emissions without harming industry.Surely a President who cannot run again -- and a Vice President who believes global warming to be a serious threat -- could  support such progressive goals.Gregg Easterbrook, a contributing editor of The Atlantic Monthly, is the author of ''A Moment on the Earth: The Coming Age of Environmental Optimism.''

FIVE years ago, in the largest gathering of its kind in history, world leaders meeting at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro signed binding treaties designed to prevent dangerous human interference with the earth's climate system and to protect living species.They also adopted a nonbinding blueprint to guide countries in protecting a deteriorating global environment while at the same time promoting economic well-being.Next Monday, 70 heads of state or government will gather at the United Nations to take stock of progress since Rio and to discuss where to go from here.But

The most notable exception, interestingly, is in an area not dealt with at Rio: population growth.Thanks to factors like contraception, education and the enhanced status of women, fertility rates are declining more rapidly than had been expected in all regions of the world. 
<<The latest United Nations projections>>
  show that  
//the  populations of many countries, including some developing ones, will stabilize within the next generation  two.//
But other countries still face high growth rates that will strain their resources, and the world population as a whole is expected to reach 11 billion before stabilizing some time in the 21st century.It now totals about 6 billion.At the same time, according to  
<<the United Nations assessment,>>
   
//food  production continues to rise, and most people are living longer and  lives.//
These gains are threatened, however, by a growing scarcity of fresh water and a loss of topsoil and productive farmland.According to  
<<the United Nations accounting,>>
   
//a  third of the world's people do not have an adequate supply of clean water, and two-thirds will be deprived of it by 2010 unless action  taken.//
Some 3.7 billion acres of farmland -- nearly 30 percent of the world's vegetated surface -- are now degraded to some degree.Air and water quality is generally improving in rich countries.But despite substantial reforestation in those countries and a recent slowing of deforestation globally, forest loss continues worldwide. 
//Each   year,//
 according to  
<<the United Nations>>
   
//an  area the size of Nepal is cut  burned.//
Ocean pollution threatens the health and livelihood of the two-thirds of humanity living near coastlines, and about 60 percent of commercial fisheries are overfished or fully fished and in danger of depletion.Toxic chemicals still pose significant threats.Under the two binding treaties signed at Rio, substantive progress has been scant.   
//The  Convention  Biodiversity//
 has been ratified by  
<<161 countries (not including the United States).>>
  
//This  treaty obligates governments to take action to protect plant and  species,//
 but species are being extinguished and their habitats are being destroyed at what  
<<the United Nations>>
   
//species  are being extinguished and their habitats are being  at//
 what <CANDIDATE> the United Nations <ACTOR> calls  
//an   rate.//
The climate treaty has been ratified by 166 countries, including the United States. But few developed countries, also including the United States, are expected to meet the treaty's initial goal of capping emissions of heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide at 1990 levels by 2000.Despite that, talks are under way on even stronger steps that would further reduce emissions of the gases. Two more sessions of the talks are scheduled in Bonn before a final session in Kyoto, Japan, in December.As the negotiations proceed, atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide continue to grow, and mainstream scientists say that if they are not reduced the world can expect a warmer climate and widespread climatic disruption in the next century.On this page are snapshots of some major aspects of the global environmental picture.
Article no :9
Five years ago, more than 100 world leaders came together for the first international Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, leaving a diaphanous trail of promises to clean the earth's atmosphere, save its rain forests and otherwise collaborate on common environmental challenges.Many of these leaders or their successors will convene at the United Nations this week to review their work.There is little to celebrate.The oceans are as polluted as ever, and deforestation proceeds at a ruinous pace.Perhaps the most conspicuous failure, however, involves the hugely contentious subject of global warming.President Clinton cannot avoid addressing that issue when he speaks on Thursday.With only 4 percent of the world's population, the United States produces more than a fifth of the ''greenhouse gases'' like carbon dioxide that are contributing to a gradual and potentially disruptive warming of the earth's surface.Moreover, the United States has fallen well short of its Rio pledge to stabilize greenhouse emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000.Only two of the industrialized nations that joined in that pledge, Germany and Britain, are expected to meet their targets.The United States will exceed it by 13 percent or more. 
<<The Administration>>
  has already conceded that  
//the  voluntary approach endorsed in Rio is  working//
 and that  
//it  will accept ''binding,'' enforceable targets on greenhouse emissions if other industrialized nations  along.//
Mr. Clinton does not have to go much beyond that in his speech.A global treaty will not be signed until a final meeting in Kyoto, Japan, in December.But he has to sketch the outlines of a credible and economically feasible plan aimed at the earliest possible reductions.He must also send a strong signal that if there is a final agreement in Kyoto, he and his Vice President, Al Gore, will work hard to get it through Congress.Any serious plan to reduce greenhouse gases will carry political risks because it will not be cost-free.Mr. Clinton's audience will want to know whether he and Mr. Gore are up to the challenge.The President has one important thing going for him.There is a far broader scientific consensus on global warming than there was in Rio five years ago and there are many more creative ideas about how to address it.Here is where the issue stands.The Science.One reason why the industrialized nations opted for voluntary targets in Rio was that mainstream scientists simply could not agree whether man-made emissions had contributed to the small rise in global temperatures that began late in the 19th century.In 1995, however, the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, consisting of about 2,500 scientists, concluded that they had.Their language was cautious, their forecasts were gloomy. 
//Unless  the current rates of combustion of carbon-based fuels -- coal, gas, oil -- could  reduced,//
  
<<they>>
  warned,  
//temperatures  would rise between 1.8 and 6.3 degrees Fahrenheit over the  century.//
Temperature changes in the middle level of that scale could cause a 20-inch rise in sea levels that would flood coastal lowlands and tropical islands, an increase in weather extremes, and global damage to forests and croplands.Despite challenges from businesses, which have been attacking the science in tobacco-industry fashion, the U.N. panel has not retreated from its basic findings.Remedies and Costs.About one-third of the atmosphere's greenhouse gases is produced by electric power plants, one-third by cars and trucks and one-third by other commercial enterprises and ordinary households.Reducing these gases not only means using less energy.It will also require expensive investments in cleaner fuels, cleaner cars and new technologies.Some industrial spokesmen have said that this is a recipe for national bankruptcy.Earlier this year, however, about 2,000 economists signed a statement asserting that the benefits of action on climate change outweighed the costs and that a well-tailored plan relying totally on market mechanisms could actually improve productivity.A study by the World Resources Institute reached the same conclusion.Both the economists and the study suggested that one mechanism could be a carbon tax that would make coal and petroleum fuels more costly and discourage consumption.The revenue from the tax would then be recycled into the economy in the form of lower payroll and corporate taxes, thus encouraging new investment.Since a carbon tax is unlikely to fly in Congress both  
<<the economists and the study>>
  suggested a more politically palatable option that the Administration has generally embraced --  
//an  international emissions-trading scheme that would set a global ceiling on emissions and give each country a  ceiling.//
The idea behind this scheme is that rich nations who cannot keep within their limits without crippling financial investments will be able to ''buy'' pollution permits from poorer countries whose economies are so inefficient that even the tiniest adjustments can achieve big reductions in greenhouse emissions.This mechanism is not without flaws, and it remains to be seen whether everyone can agree on such a complicated scheme before Kyoto.But in the long run Mr. Clinton's greatest problem may to be to convince Congress, which must ratify whatever emerges from Kyoto, to take the issue of global warming as seriously as the scientists do.That means taking it seriously himself and getting his Vice President, who has been silent on the issue of late, to speak out.It was  
<<Mr. Gore>>
  after all, who asserted in ''Earth in the Balance''  
//that  global warming ''threatens to destroy the climate equilibrium we have known for the entire history of the  race.//
The longer we wait, the more unpleasant our choices become.''
Article no :10
The leaders of the eight countries that together represent about half of the world's economic activity called today for rapid democratic elections in Hong Kong, renewed energy to break the stalemate in the Middle East, a new commitment to peace in Bosnia, and new aid for Africa.But in a sharp dispute with France and other European nations that dominated this morning's final session of ''The Summit of the Eight,''  
<<President Clinton>>
  refused to  
//commit  the United States to a specific reduction in the emission of carbon dioxide and the other greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming, agreeing only to ''substantial reductions''  2010.//
 
<<Mr. Clinton>>
  also acknowledged, in his closing news conference, that he had  
//failed  to resolve differences with France and Italy over how many countries should be invited to join NATO in the first round of expansion, with the Madrid summit meeting of the Atlantic alliance less than six  away.//

Article no :10
While  
<<all 16 NATO countries>>
  agree that  
//Poland,  Hungary and the Czech Republic should be invited to join  Madrid,//
Other countries also favor the admission of Slovenia, but  
<<Mr. Clinton>>
  said  
//an  initial NATO expansion is best limited to those countries that are ''most qualified'' to enter, while leaving the door open to further  later.//
Referring to Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, Mr. Clinton s national security adviser,  
<<Samuel R. Berger,>>
  said today that  
//''there  is a consensus around the three, but there is not a consensus around  others,''//
 and  
//that  invitations would go to those countries where there  consensus.//
While Mr. Clinton hoped to reach agreement before the Madrid meeting, Mr. Berger noted that the new Prime Minister of Britain,  
<<Tony Blair,>>
  now  
//supports  the  position.//

Article no :10
In his news conference, Mr. Clinton also defended his policies toward China and the Middle East.
Article no :10
 
<<He>>
  called for the House of Representatives in a vote expected this week, to support his extension of a normal trading status with China, arguing that  
//''we  shouldn't assume bad faith on the part of the Chinese'' in their commitment to provide Hong Kong ''a high degree  autonomy.//
''Still,over Chinese objections, the group of eight countries here -- Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United States and Russia -- urged Beijing to guarantee Hong Kong's ''fundamental freedoms and the rule of law,'' its independent economic and monetary system, and to hold ''democratic elections'' for a new legislature ''as soon as possible.''The final communique, in its section on the Middle East, also implicitly criticized Washington. ''The peace process faces a crisis, and we are determined to re-inject momentum into it,'' the document said.But Mr. Clinton rejected calls from President Jacques Chirac of France and other leaders to get more visibly involved in pushing the Israelis and Palestinians back to the negotiating table.A senior American official said today that the refusal of Mr. Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright to go to the Middle East showed courage. ''The tough choice she and the President are making is to sit tight and wait for the parties to realize that they must take the steps necessary to get the process back on track.''Mr.Clinton noted that the Middle East is at ''a pivotal moment'' and added: ''You should never believe that just because you don't see high-level air transport between Washington and the Middle East that nothing is going on from our point of view.I spend quite a bit of time on this every week.''And he repeated his position that to restore confidence, the Palestinans must ''express clear opposition to terrorism'' and commitment to the peace effort, while the Israelis ''need to show in specific ways'' that they are committed to the existing Oslo peace accords and will not try to undermine them unilaterally.

The summit meeting was notable for its inclusion of Russia as a full member in all sessions except a one-hour monetary meeting on Saturday, and Mr. Clinton again praised Russia's President, Boris N. Yeltsin, and the Russian people today for pursuing a path toward democracy, market development and integration with the West.Mr. Yeltsin, who underwent heart surgery last year, skipped last night's boisterous entertainment because of fatigue.He did meet with Mr. Chirac today and participated in the closing sessions, although he appeared grimmer and more pasty.Ms. Albright spent some of her time here exploring how the former Khmer Rouge leader, Pol Pot, might be brought to international justice for the genocidal crimes his government committed in Cambodia from 1975 to 1979, officials said.Mr. Clinton said that ''there probably should be an international war crimes tribunal'' that is permanent.But  
//the  main topic of contention was the environment and greenhouse gases, with  Chirac//
 described by  
<<American officials>>
  as  
//''prickly   aggressive,''//
  
//pushing  hard for a specific American commitment to  Europe's.//
 
<<The European Union>>
  agreed last week to  
//cut  its emissions of greenhouse gases to 15 percent of its 1990 levels  2010.//
 
<<Mr. Clinton>>
  refused to  
//commit  to a specific figure here, though Washington is supposed to do so in six months at an international conference on the issue in  Japan.//
American officials say the European demands are ''unreasonable'' and do not reflect American conditions.Mr. Chirac, in his news conference, shrugged and said: ''Americans are major polluters.The average American is responsible for emitting three times the amount of greenhouse gas as the average Frenchman.''But  
<<Mr. Chirac>>
  said that  
//European  unity had at least pushed the Americans to agree on 2010 for  reductions,''//
On Bosnia, Mr. Clinton said he was pleased that the nations here agreed on pursuing all aspects of the Dayton accords, including the return of refugees, freedom of movement for all ethnic groups and the punishment of war criminals.They also agreed that aid to the parties should be conditional on their fulfillment of those promises.Mr. Clinton also repeated his position that the current military mission in Bosnia should be over in July 1998.European officials like Mr. Blair have said they believe that Bosnia will still require an international military presence after July 1998, but Clinton officials still say they ''fully expect'' that American soliders will leave then.The communique pleased the Americans by calling for a fairer reassessment of United Nations dues and supported Mr. Clinton's initiative to help African countries by opening markets and reducing duties.But the Europeans also insisted that market access and capitalism could not replace direct aid, and the French and Japanese agreed to work together on their own aid and investment initiative in Africa.Mr. Chirac said he was glad Washington was now thinking about Africa, while Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, speaking sarcastically, said he welcomed ''America's discovery of Africa.''
Article no :11
With  
<<Tony Blair>>
  the new British Prime Minister, in the rhetorical vanguard, European heads of state came before a gloom-and-doom conference of the world's nations today and demanded ever more  
//forceful  actions by the United States to confront environmental trends like  warming.//
One after another, as delegates reviewed how the world has fallen short of the ambitious environmental goals set by the United Nations five years ago,  
<<the leaders of the European Union>>
  repeated  
//the  message that they had delivered to the  Administration//
 in private meetings over the weekend: that  
//they  do not believe that the United States is being aggressive enough in seeking steep reductions in greenhouse  emissions.//
This time their audience was dominated by leaders of the less developed countries.They are at the United Nations this week to assess progress, or the lack of it, since  
<<a United Nations>>
  conference in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 put  
//the  threat of global warming and other issues of environment and development at the top of the  agenda.//
With the poorer countries in mind, Japan, which like the United States is taking a cautious approach on reducing greenhouse gases, and Britain, which unlike the United States is calling for aggressive actions, both pledged substantial new commitments of aid to the developing world to help their economies grow without causing even more pollution from burning fossil fuels.And Germany, Brazil, South Africa and Singapore called for a new worldwide environmental organization to reinvigorate the United Nations' lackluster performance.Perhaps the warmest applause of the day came for  
<<Mr. Blair>>
  who pledged  
//Britain's  willingness to do even more to reduce greenhouse gases than the rest of Europe  promised,//
 
//Saying  that ''some of the great industrialized nations'' have not achieved their past promises to reduce greenhouse  emissions,//
  
<<Mr. Blair>>
  said  
//Britain,  which under a Conservative Government changed coal policies and kept its promises on carbon emissions, would do even more now that the Labor Party is at  helm.//
''Our targets will not be taken seriously by the poorer countries until the richer countries are meeting them,'' he said.''The biggest responsibility falls on those countries with the biggest emissions,'' he said, in an unmistakable reference to the United States. ''We in Europe have put our cards on the table.It is time for the special pleading to stop and for others to follow suit.''PresidentClinton is to address the gathering on Thursday, amid intense criticism from environmental advocates who say his  
<<Administration>>
  is not taking a  
//firm  enough stance in negotiations, scheduled to be concluded in December in  Japan,//
 aimed at  
//setting  binding targets for reducing  gases.//
But the Administration is under pressure in Congress to do nothing that would impose costs on powerful industries, or that would curtail the use of fossil fuels by wealthy countries but not poorer ones.And its negotiators have been making another argument: that it is simply impossible to meet the ambitious timetables proposed by the Europeans, who want to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases by 15 percent from the levels of 1990, and to do so by the year 2010. 
//At   Rio//

//welcomed  the delegates with a brief call to ''roll up our sleeves and go to work'' on the undone business  Rio,//

<<Jacques Chirac of France, Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany and other European leaders>>
  echoed the

At a news conference, other members of Mr. Blair's Government muted somewhat the implied criticism of the White House.

Following is a transcript of  
<<President Clinton>>
  s address to the United Nations environmental conference yesterday, as provided by the Federal News Service, a private transcription company:  
//Five  years ago in Rio, the nations of the world joined together around a simple but revolutionary proposition: that today's progress must not come at  expense.//
In our era, the environment has moved to the top of the international agenda because how well a nation honors it will have an impact, for good or ill, not only on the people of that nation, but all across the globe.Preserving the resources we share is crucial not only for the quality of our individual environments and health, but also to maintain stability and peace within nations and among them.As the father of conservation in our nation,  
<<John Muir>>
  said,  
//''When  we try to pick anything out by itself, we find it hitched to everything else in  universe.//
''In the years since Rio there has been real progress in some areas.Nations have banned the dumping of radioactive wastes in the ocean and reduced marine pollution from sources on land.We're working to protect the precious coral reefs, to conserve threatened fish, to stop the advance of deserts.At the Cairo Conference on Population and Development, we reaffirmed the crucial importance of cooperative family planning efforts to long-term sustainable development.Here in America, we have worked to clean up a record number of our toxic dumps, and we intend to clean 500 more over the next four years.

//''When  we try to pick anything out by itself, we find it hitched to everything else in  universe.//
''In the years since Rio there has been real progress in some areas.Nations have banned the dumping of radioactive wastes in the ocean and reduced marine pollution from sources on land.We're working to protect the precious coral reefs, to conserve threatened fish, to stop the advance of deserts.At the Cairo Conference on Population and Development, we reaffirmed the crucial importance of cooperative family planning efforts to long-term sustainable development.Here in America, we have worked to clean up a record number of our toxic dumps, and we intend to clean 500 more over the next four years.We've passed new laws to better protect our water, created new national parks and monuments, and worked to harmonize our efforts for environmental protection, economic growth, and social improvement, aided by a distinguished Council on Sustainable Development.Yesterday I announced the most far-reaching efforts to improve air quality in our nation in 20 years, cutting smog levels dramatically and, for the first time ever, setting standards to lower the levels of the fine particles in the atmosphere that form soot.In America, the incidence of childhood asthma has been increasing rapidly.It is now the single biggest reason our children are hospitalized.These measures will help to change that, to improve health of people of all ages, and to prevent as many as 15,000 premature deaths a year.Still, we here have much more to do, especially in reducing America's contribution to global climate change.The science is clear and compelling: We humans are changing the global climate.Concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are at their highest levels in more than 200,000 years and climbing sharply.If the trend does not change, scientists expect the seas to rise two feet or more over the next century.In America, that means 9,000 square miles of Florida, Louisiana and other coastal areas will be flooded; in Asia, 17 percent of Bangladesh, land on which six million people now live, will be lost; island chains such as the Maldives will disappear from the map unless we reverse the predictions.Climate changes will disrupt agriculture, cause severe droughts and floods and the spread of infectious diseases, which will be a big enough problem for us under the best of circumstances in the 21st century.There could be 50 million or more cases of malaria a year.We can expect more deaths from heat stress.Just two years ago here in the United States in the city of Chicago, we saw the tragedy of more than 400 of our citizens dying during a severe heat wave.No nation can escape this danger.None can evade its responsibility to confront it, and we must all do our part, industrial nations that emit the largest quantities of greenhouse gases today, and developing nations whose greenhouse gas emissions are growing rapidly.
Article no :12
 
<<I>>
  applaud  
//the  European Union for its strong focus on  issue//
 and  
//the  World Bank for setting environmental standards for projects it will finance in the  world.//
Here in the United States, we must do better.With 4 percent of the world's population, we already produce more than 20 percent of its greenhouse gases.Frankly, our record since Rio is not sufficient.We have been blessed with high rates of growth and millions of new jobs over the last few years, but that has led to an increase in greenhouse-gas emissions in spite of the adoption of new conservation practices.So we must do better, and we will.The air-quality action I took on yesterday is a positive first step, but many more must follow.In order to reduce greenhouse gases and grow the economy, we must invest more in the technologies of the future.I am directing my Cabinet to work to develop them.Government, universities, business and labor must work together.All these efforts must be sustained over years, indeed, over decades.As Vice President  
<<Gore>>
  said Monday,  
//''Sustainable  development requires  commitment.''//
With that commitment, we can succeed.We must create new technologies and develop new strategies like emissions trading that will both curtail pollution and support continued economic growth.We owe that in the developed world to ourselves, and equally to those in the developing nations.Many of the technologies that will help us to meet the new air quality standards in America can also help address climate change.This is a challenge we must undertake immediately, and one in which I personally plan to play a critical role.In the United States, in order to do our part,  
<<we>>
  have to first convince the American people and the Congress that  
//the  climate change problem is real  imminent.//
I will convene a White House Conference on Climate Change later this year to lay the scientific facts before our people to understand that we must act, and to lay the economic facts there so that they will understand the benefits and the costs.With the best ideas and strategies, and new technologies and increased productivity and energy efficiency, we can turn the challenge to our advantage.We will work with our people, and we will bring to the Kyoto conference a strong American commitment to realistic and binding limits that will significantly reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases.I want to mention three other initiatives briefly that we are taking to deal with climate change and to advance sustainable development here and beyond our borders.First, to help developing nations reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the United States will provide a billion dollars in assistance over the next five years to support energy efficiency, develop alternative energy sources, and improve resource management to promote growth that does not have an adverse effect on the climate.Second, we will do more to encourage private investment to meet environmental standards.The Overseas Private Investment Corporation will now require that its projects adhere to new and strengthened environmental guidelines, just as our Export-Import Bank already does, and as I hope our allies and friends soon will.Common guidelines for responsible investment clearly would lead to more sustainable growth in developing nations.Third, we must increase our use of new technologies even as we move to develop more new technologies.Already we are working with our auto industry to produce cars by early in the next century that are three times as fuel efficient as today's vehicles.Now we will work with businesses and communities to use the sun's energy to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels by installing solar panels on one million more roofs around our nation by 2010.Capturing the sun's warmth can help us to turn down the Earth's temperature.Distinguished leaders, in all our cultures we have been taught from time immemorial that, as scripture says, ''One generation passes away and another comes, but the Earth abides forever.''We must strengthen our stewardship of the environment to make that true, and to insure that when this generation passes, the young man who just spoke before me, and all of those of his generation, will inherit a rich and abundant Earth.CLINTONAT THE U.N.
Article no :13
President Clinton this week confronted the two most important environmental questions of the year, how to slow global warming and how to tighten the Clean Air Act.He satisfied the environmentalists in his constituency on the issue of smog and soot, but deeply disappointed many of them today on the question of climate change.It was a striking disparity, given that the two environmental problems have some important common roots.Soot and smog, like greenhouse gases, come mainly from burning fossil fuels.Imaginative new approaches to controlling both kinds of pollution are likely to involve plans for trading emissions credits and perfecting new technologies.But there are important differences, and these illustrate why the President found himself seeming so torn on the overall question of what to do about air pollution.For one thing, many ordinary people have immediate concerns about the smog they breathe and the way it and particles in the air can worsen the illnesses of their young children and aging parents.Not so many are worried about rising sea levels caused by melting glaciers, or about the scientific subtleties of global warming.For another thing, President Clinton faced a pressing deadline for deciding on the new air pollution rules, which under a court order had to be issued by July.His ultimate decisions about how fast to move on global warming are not due until December, when international negotiations sponsored by the United Nations culminate in Kyoto, Japan.And above all, fixing the global warming problem requires not just more powerful medicine, but a lot more of it, than controlling local smokestacks and tailpipes.To satisfy the critics demanding swift and decisive action from the United States to head off global warming, Mr. Clinton would have to pledge that a nation in the midst of an energy binge was about to break its addiction to cheap fossil fuels.And that implies an act of extraordinary political will.At the United Nations today,  
<<Mr. Clinton>>
  promised to  
//mobilize  his own country in such  effort,//
In the President's own crucial word, any goals he will eventually accept must be ''realistic. 
<<''The industry giants>>
  who lambasted the Administration for its decision on air quality on Wednesday  
//praised  Mr. Clinton's caution on global  today.//
 
//''We  are encouraged by the fact that President Clinton seems to be taking a slightly more cautious approach to climate issues than he appeared to be taking several  ago,''//
 said  
<<Gail McDonald,>>
 There are many vested interests pushing very hard for an agreement that would have dire consequences for the economy.''Several policies favored by many environmentalists are seen by the Administration as unrealistic.Energy taxes as a way to lower fuel consumption are pretty well ruled out in Washington's current political climate.Regulations to enforce fuel-efficiency on automakers are equally out of favor. 
<<Federico Pena>>
  Mr. Clinton's Energy Secretary, said in an interview today that  
//the  most important thing in the President's speech was his commitment to proselytizing the public on the urgency of  problem//
 and then  
//to  persuading the country that the solution will not be  painful.//
''We have not done a good job of educating the American people, first about the challenges we face on global warming, and secondly about the value of making the long-term investments that actually pay back in your pocketbook,'' he said.It is impossible to say, of course, whether technology breakthroughs of the kind Mr. Clinton vowed to pursue are the most realistic way of weaning America from coal and oil.Despite the progress toward wider use of photovoltaic solar cells, electric cars, fuel cells that run on hydrogen, and so on, the technical hurdles are still formidable. 
//''Solar  energy is an important part of the long-term solution, but it is no substitute for binding targets and timetables for reducing  soon,''//
 said  
<<Michael Oppenheimer>>
 America is, after all, a nation where energy waste is common enough that many readily available conservation measures could pay for themselves by reducing the energy costs of businesses and households.Still, market mechanisms do not yet exist to drive investments in those directions, at least not at the speed needed to dramatically slow emissions of carbon dioxide, the principal greenhouse gas.The Administration is working hard to develop an approach toward holding down emissions that will create pollution permits that companies can buy and sell to each other.Known as the ''cap and trade'' approach, it is intended to steer investments in pollution control toward the cheapest possible solutions.It pleases some environmental groups, but others view it with the suspicion of a grandmother confronted with a newfangled gadget.But  
<<the White House>>
  appears to be persuaded by its own economists that  
//the  economic pain of abruptly taking new paths on energy consumption might be too great  bear,//
 and that  
//a  more moderate approach is  for.//
Such conclusions are amplified in dire warnings from powerful industries about the dangers of moving too quickly.Fed by an economic boom that has overwhelmed steady improvements in industrial energy efficiency, its gas-guzzling vehicles slaked by affordable gasoline, the United States appears likely to increase emissions of carbon dioxide by 13 percent in this decade.This is just the reverse of what it promised to do five years ago in Rio de Janeiro, where the industrial countries aimed to reduce greenhouse gas output to the level of 1990 by the year 2000.As  
<<Mr. Clinton>>
  said in his speech,  
//only  1 out of every 25 people on the planet is an American, but the fuel they burn produces one out of every five tons of the carbon dioxide that is steadily building up in the atmosphere, threatening to seriously disrupt the climate 100 or 200 years  now.//
To be sure, some countries have met their targets and others are willing to promise to obey a new, binding treaty that would actually reduce greenhouse gases further.The target  
<<the European Union>>
  proposes is  
//to  cut emissions by 15 percent from the 1990 level, achieving that goal by the  2010.//
The British cut emissions when they ended subsidies for an inefficient coal industry.The Germans, after unification, tore down the obsolete state-run factories of the east.Russia met the target of reducing emissions, but only because its economy collapsed along with Communism.And as a whole, Europe does not have the aversion to energy taxes -- or taxes in general -- that has been displayed in the United States, where  
<<the Clinton Administration's>>
  first big economic policy defeat was on the BTU tax, and where just last year Congress, egged on by Bob Dole, was busily  
//trying  to roll back gas taxes because of a blip in prices at  pump.//
CLINTON ATTHE U.N.: AN ASSESSMENT

  went further tonight than he has before in  
//endorsing  scientific findings establishing the dangers  pollution.//
''The science is clear and compelling: We humans are changing the global climate,'' he said. ''Concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are at their highest levels in more than 200,000 years and climbing sharply.''$( Transcript, page A11.$)Mr. Clinton's speech fit the tone of the conference, which has been attended this week by the heads of state of about 70 nations.The debate over the environment here has been marked by talk of crisis, bitter criticism of international foot-dragging and apocalyptic visions of a stricken planet.Warning that

//the  seas to rise by two feet or more in the  century,//
  
//Mr.  Clinton envisioned an America in which ''9,000 square miles of Florida, Louisiana, and other coastal areas will  flooded.''//
He spoke of an increase of 50 million or more malaria cases worldwide each year.''No nation can escape this danger,'' he said. ''None can evade its responsibility to confront it.'' 
<<Mr. Clinton>>
  noted that with  
//4  percent of the world's population, the United States emits 20 percent of its greenhouse gases, which are defined as carbon dioxide emissions generated by anything that burns fossil fuels like oil  coal.//
Here in the United States, we must do better,'' he said.But just last weekend at an annual summit meeting of industrialized nations held in Denver,  
<<Mr. Clinton>>
  fended off demands from the French and Germans that he  
//move  immediately to restrict  emissions.//
Privately, his aides said the Europeans were more interested in posturing for their voters back home than in setting immediate and strict goals that could also prove difficult for them to meet.Further, Mr. Clinton faces less pressure domestically on the issue of greenhouse gases than he did over soot and smog.While heat waves, like the one in Chicago that was blamed for more than 400 deaths two years ago, have periodically drawn public attention to the issue of global warming, on a daily basis, parents ferrying their children to baseball practice are more likely to fret about the smog.Today, the President said he would take action on greenhouse gases later this year. 
<<He>>
  said he would  
//''work  with our people and we will bring to the Kyoto conference a strong American commitment to realistic and binding limits that will significantly reduce our emissions of  gases.''Within//

<<Fred Krupp>>
  head of the Environmental Defense Fund, said  
//President  Clinton's failure to set specific timetables for reduction of greenhouse gases made ''instant Pablum'' out of his speech, despite the promises of foreign aid and advanced research aimed at controlling  change.//

  said it was very significant that  
//Mr.  Clinton had endorsed the scientific consensus that the problem  serious,//
 and  
//had  pledged to educate the public and persuade the Congress to  it.//
 
<<Mr. Clinton>>
  promised some modest steps tonight to begin  
//tackling  the problem of  change//
 -- two of them intended to  
//modify  the practices of foreign countries, rather than of the  States.//
He promised $1 billion in assistance, already proposed in his budget plan, to help third-world nations manage their resources and develop alternative energy sources.He also said the United States would require that certain projects it helps finance overseas meet new environmental standards.Lastly, he said the United States would try to increase its own use of  more environmentally friendly technologies, including solar energy.In keeping with rules at the conference, most speeches have lasted about seven minutes.Mr. Clinton spoke for 12 minutes.He wrestled with the wording of his remarks all afternoon after attending the burial of a great-uncle in Hope, Ark.  
<<Bill Richardson>>
  United States representative to the United Nations, said  
//Mr.  Clinton's decision on Wednesday to tighten pollution restrictions had helped allay other nations' doubts about the Administration, proving it was ''serious about  environment.//
''Asked why the President decided not to move immediately on the issue of greenhouse gases as well,  
<<Mr. Richardson>>
  said,  
//''We've  got to build support with the Congress and the American  first,''//
 adding, ''I think  
//there'll  be a good basis to move aggressively  Kyoto.''Mr.//
 
<<Clinton>>
  said he  
//needed  to generate more support before trying to cut  emissions.//
To do so,  
<<he>>
  said, he  
//will  hold a White House conference on climate change later  year,//
  
//''to  lay the scientific facts before our people, to understand that we must act, and to lay the economic facts there so that they understand the benefits and  costs.//
''Mr.Clinton intended his appearance at the United Nations tonight to  raise his profile on environmental issuesdramatically.He had announced his intention to attend during a speech in a Costa Rican rain forest on May 9.In that speech, he issued a more hedged warning about the dangers of climate change. 
//''There  is some doubt about what increased greenhouse gas emissions are doing to  climate,''//
  
<<Mr. Clinton>>
  said then, ''but  
//no  one doubts that they're changing the climate, and no one doubts that the potential consequences can be very profound  severe.//
''The special session of the General Assembly was called to assess what progress has been made toward solving global environmental problems since the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro five years ago.When the conference ends on Friday night, representatives of 199 countries and international organizations will have spoken, including 42 heads of state or government, a couple of princes and dozens of ministers.There was little expectation that the conference would break any new ground or reach any new agreements.The highlight of the week was the unexpectedly strong language used by Europeans in urging the United States to take a leadership role in solving environmental problems.Britain's Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook, said on Monday that this meant the American people as well as the Clinton Administration.Nations from the third world wanted promises of more aid to help alleviate pollution and other problems.Except for offers of some assistance from Japan and the United States, no such pledges materialized.CLINTON ATTHE U.N.: THE OVERVIEW
Article no :15
A week after government leaders from around the world trooped in by the dozens to assess the global environment five years after the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, the international conference they addressed ground to a quiet close today in an atmosphere tinged with gloom.While nonstop speeches went on in the hall of  
<<the General Assembly committees of nations>>
  bickered for days but were unable to agree on concrete proposals in three critical areas:  
//cutting  emissions to head off  warming,//
  
//protecting   forests//
 and  
//increasing  aid to poor nations who are ruining their environments through  development.//
In all of these areas, many nations had been looking to the United States for leadership, another demonstration of the enormous power Washington has in the United Nations, even though Washington has been the target of criticism for failing to pay its dues.When  
<<President Clinton>>
  in his speech on Thursday, backed away from  
//setting  numerical targets for American emissions reductions as Europeans  asked,//
This will give little time to negotiate acceptable levels of emissions reductions with developing countries, some of which are already reluctant to agree to any controls if someone else does not pay for the cost of environmental improvements.In coming decades, large developing countries like India and China will be major emitters of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane.''With less than six months to go to Kyoto, we still haven't heard any near-term specifics from the Clinton Administration,''Howard Ris, executive director of the Union of Concerned Scientists, said after Mr. Clinton's speech. ''We need to tackle global warming now, not tomorrow.''But today, diplomats and a number of environmental groups found silver linings in the President's speech, welcoming his statements that recognized the danger of global warming and the role that human activity -- most of all in the United States -- plays in creating and worsening the problem.Many also welcomed the President's pledge to inform the American people why the issue of greenhouse gases was important.American public opinion played a significant part in building up the international awareness of environmental issues a decade ago, and partly drove the momentum that made the Earth Summit in Rio a success in 1992.It became apparent today that it was not only the United States and other industrial nations that stalled agreements on major issues.At a news conference marking the end of the meeting the United Nations calls ''Earth Summit + 5,''  
<<Razali Ismail,>>
  president of the General Assembly and Malaysia's United Nations representative, said that  
//both  rich and poor nations had shown a lack of political will to force more than  compromises.//
The conference produced a closing document that took small steps in areas of freshwater conservation, forest use and the financing of environmentally sustainable development, including the need to look at harmful government subsidies.But a separate statement of commitment to action on the environment was scrapped because countries could not agree on the wording. 
<<Mr. Razali>>
  who was a major player in the Rio conference in 1992, said that  
//not  only were indicators of environmental destruction worse  year,//
 but also  
//the  spirit of Rio  gone.''We//
  
//reached  the zenith of our enthusiasm and commitment for sustainable development and the environment  1992,''//
Since then many other things have come our way which have distracted our attention from that.Since then a sense of parochialism has spread over much of the developed world, a parochialism that affected the willingness of those countries to make available funds or resources, all kinds of things, technology transfer.''''This special session should go down as a very honest attempt to try to make an appraisal of the results, and of how far we have gone from Rio,'' he said. ''There was very little attempt to try to sweep things under the carpet or put a gloss over something that's not there.''Speaking at a separate news conference today,  
<<Barbara J. Bramble>>
  director of the international office of the National Wildlife Federation in Washington, said that  
//this  had been a week of ''standstill'' in areas environmental groups had  action.//
''All is not lost,'' she said. ''There's an awful lot of language that shows slow bits of progress.But that is a total disconnect in time scale between what is being done and what is really needed.''
Article no :16
There was no way that  
<<President Clinton>>
  could  
//satisfy  everyone in his address last week to the United Nations on  change,//
By embracing the scientific community's assessment that global warming is a real threat with potentially appalling consequences, he annoyed powerful industries who have been challenging that science because they will bear many of the costs of dealing with the problem.By refusing to embrace a specific timetable for reducing the greenhouse gases that help cause global warming, he disappointed many environmentalists who had hoped for a less ambiguous commitment and faster action.But none of that should have been surprising.What was surprising was the impressive challenge Bill Clinton set for himself.The U.N. session was merely the first in a series of international meetings that will culminate in Kyoto, Japan, in December, where both industrialized and developing nations are expected to sign a treaty binding them to a detailed plan of action.In the interim,  
<<Mr. Clinton>>
  says he  
//will  try to educate the American people about the nature of  problem//
 and  
//give  them some straight talk about the costs they will bear and the sacrifices they will have  make.//
 
//Without  such  campaign,//
  
<<he>>
  implied,  
//he  cannot possibly sell Congress on a program that would impose real costs on individuals and on major producers and users of fossil fuels like the big utilities, the oil companies and the automobile and  industries.//
This will be a huge task, and the most important question, now and after Kyoto, is whether Mr. Clinton is up to it.He must first educate a country that is in the midst of an energy binge to the idea that it will have to break its addiction to the fossil fuels that cause greenhouse gases and, meanwhile, invest heavily in new technologies.He must then sell those same ideas to a  
<<Congress>>
  that is already complaining that  
//the  more modest measures he announced last week to attack ground-level smog  soot//
Mr. Clinton has other tricky tasks that extend beyond America's borders.He and his negotiators must join with the industrialized nations on a plan to spread the costs fairly among nations, as well as a scheme to bring the developing countries into the effort.Some climate experts believe that the developing countries deserve more time to build their economies with even greater use of fossil fuels, as the industrialized countries have done for 150 years.Others believe they should be assigned specific emissions limits right away.What everyone agrees on is that without the participation of big polluters like China and India, any scheme to limit greenhouse gases will be a farce.Mr. Clinton has asked for six months to do all this.The measure of his success will be whether he has a credible plan ready in time for Kyoto.

After five years of worrying that  
//the  Clinton Administration might tighten air  regulations,//
 the  
<<auto industry's>>
  
<<President Clinton>>
  approved  
//more  stringent metropolitan air quality standards  Wednesday.//
A day later, in a more serious blow to the auto industry, the President declared that at an international conference next December in Kyoto, Japan, the United States would favor the adoption of binding limits on so-called greenhouse gases, which may contribute to global warming. 
<<Auto industry>>
  officials had been fretting about both issues for months, and they have already begun  
//lobbying  Congress to block both  initiatives.//
 
//International  carbon dioxide limits are an unnecessarily drastic response to a global warming threat that has not yet been proved  exist,//
 said  
<<Andrew H. Card Jr.>>
 The metropolitan air quality rules, he said, ''are ill-conceived, economically disadvantageous to the country and will put a particular burden on the auto industry and the people of Michigan.''Controls on the emissions of carbon dioxide, one of the greenhouse gases, represent a potentially dire threat to auto makers.Carbon dioxide is produced in large quantities when gasoline is burned in an internal combustion engine.Reducing carbon dioxide emissions means improving fuel economy or reducing the number of cars on the road.Detroit auto makers in particular are already struggling to meet existing fuel economy standards as they sell ever more Jeeps and other gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles.Tighter standards could severely crimp profits.Auto industry executives have been downright caustic in recent speeches about the possibility of carbon dioxide limits. '' 
//This  sort of fuzzy thinking provides the warm illusion of saving the sky, which we're not even sure needs saving, but it won't have any impact at all on  warming,''//
 said  
<<Robert J. Eaton>>
 It will just move jobs to those countries which are allowed to spew whatever they want into the air.''President 
<<Clinton>>
  chose on Thursday not to  
//impose  immediate carbon  limits,//
The main goal of industry lobbying has been to make sure that any carbon dioxide limits negotiated in Kyoto were voluntary, not binding.Detroit executives are convinced that only the United States would actually obey binding limits while other countries would flout them.Auto makers have tried to market vehicles that can burn natural gas or alcohol or run on electric power from batteries.But demand has been remarkably weak, with Federal, state and local agencies often ignoring laws designed to force them to buy alternative-fuel vehicles. 
<<Ford>>
  the main producer of such vehicles, announced on Friday that  
//it  would broaden its lineup to 11 models this autumn, including several that burn ethanol, a type  alcohol.//
Yet Ford had combined sales of just 8,461 alternative-fuel vehicles across five model lines last year.Behind the dismay in Detroit about the latest Administration moves lies a very real worry at General Motors, Ford and Chrysler that they will be put at a competitive disadvantage,  against their foreign-company rivals.Ford and particularly Chrysler already produce more sport utility vehicles, mini-vans and pickup trucks than cars.But cars tend to be much more fuel-efficient and therefore produce less carbon dioxide.G.M. will be producing more so-called light trucks than cars within several years, while most foreign auto makers overwhelmingly make cars and will continue doing so.The metropolitan air quality standards could also hurt Detroit's Big Three.While the Big Three still have many of their factories in big Midwestern cities with pollution problems, Japanese and European auto makers have chosen to build their newer assembly plants in small Southern towns.Though these choices of factory sites were mainly aimed at forestalling unionization, the sites also tend to have clean air that is likely to meet the more stringent standards without any extra spending by the foreign auto makers.

After tinkering with computer models for more than a year,  
<<the Clinton Administration>>
  predicted today that  
//measures  to combat the growth of global warming by limiting the emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases that trap heat from the sun would have a far less dramatic effect on the economy than had been projected by industries opposed to restraints on  use.//
The Administration's analysis opens what is expected to be a long campaign between now and the end of the year, when international negotiations are scheduled to conclude in Kyoto, Japan, to build support for a proposed binding treaty to limit the emissions of those kinds of gases.Any measures to reverse the steady growth in such emissions, mostly given off by burning fossil fuels to operate cars and generate electricity and heat, would probably involve the biggest Federal intervention in energy markets since oil-exporting countries raised oil prices substantially in the 1970's.But  
<<the Administration>>
  s computer models suggested that  
//the  economic side effects would be only half as severe as those projected in a recent study by economists at Charles River Associates for the American Petroleum Institute, a lobbying group for  producers.//
 
<<Critics>>
  who say  
//the  Administration is moving too fast on  warming//
 have warned  
//that  mines and factories would close, inflation would rise and productivity  fall.//
But another school of thought holds that energy conservation can pay for itself and that new technologies can be found, offering major economic gains, not to mention the benefits of limiting global warming and its potentially serious effects.As the Administration tries to decide how fast and how far to cut those gas emissions, the question of the treaty's economic effect is being asked with increasing urgency in Congress, which has ultimate authority over the country's energy policy.In addition, any treaty would have to be submitted to the Senate for ratification.In a staff paper released today,  
<<the White House>>
  said  
//tough  action on such gas emissions might, over the next few decades, shave a fraction of a percent from the nation's  growth,//
  
//followed  by a recovery -- or might, if implemented cleverly, have a barely discernible effect or even a net  benefit.//
''It just boils down to this,'' Janet Yellen, chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers, said at a hearing of the House Commerce committee. ''If we do it dumb, it could cost a lot, but if we do it smart, it will cost much less, and indeed could produce net benefits in the long run.''Ms.Yellen's comments were met with skepticism from both the ranking Republican and Democrat on the committee, and by many junior members of the panel as  
//well.''Unfortunately,  in the area of global climate change, the Administration has not yet presented a  case,''//
 said Representative  
<<Thomas J. Bliley Jr.,>>
 Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, treated Ms. Yellen and Timothy Wirth, the Undersecretary of State for Global Affairs, to a sometimes blistering questioning. 
<<Mr. Dingell>>
  whose district is a prime manufacturer of automobiles, said the  
//analysis  suggested ''huge economic constraints'' on  businesses.//
 
//According  to the Administration  projections,//
  
<<Mr. Dingell>>
  said,  
//stabilizing  emissions at their 1990 levels by 2010 would require steps equivalent to charging about $100 for every ton of carbon emitted when a fossil fuel  burned.//
That would be like raising the tax on gasoline of about 26 cents a gallon, a tax on electricity of 2 cents per kilowatt hour, a tax on coal of $52.52 per ton, and a tax on natural gas of $1.49 per thousand cubic feet.But,  
<<Administration officials>>
  said,  
//the  projections are put in terms of taxes merely because that is the easiest way for economists to model things that are even more complex than the  code.//
Nobody seriously expects  
<<the White House>>
  to  
//propose  a big increase in the  tax.//
 
<<The White House>>
  supports a treaty that would  
//bind  the United States and other developed countries to significant reductions in emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases, leaving each country to decide how it wanted to  so.//

Article no :20
 
<<The Senate>>
  unanimously urged the Clinton Administration today not to  
//pursue  a treaty that would limit the industrial world's emissions of greenhouse gases unless the agreement requires developing countries to control their rapidly growing emissions at the  time.//
While it is not binding,  
<<the Senate>>
  resolution complicates the continuing negotiations for a new treaty to  
//prevent  global warming caused by increasing levels of carbon dioxide as people burn more  fuel.//
The Senate would have to consent by a two-thirds vote to the ratification of any such treaty by the United States.The resolution criticizing the Administration's current negotiating approach passed, 95 to 0.In the debate, many senators expressed skepticism that global warming was a serious problem or that the United States, as the leading emitter of gases like carbon dioxide that trap heat from the sun, should do more than poorer nations to reverse it.But even those senators who favor a treaty voted for the resolution after its chief sponsor, Senator  
<<Robert C. Byrd>>
  of West Virginia, expressly  
//endorsed  the scientific consensus behind the global  theory//
 and  
//signaled  that less developed countries ought to be granted more flexibility in cutting emissions, as long as they accept the  commitments.//
The final negotiations for the treaty are to be made at a meeting in Kyoto, Japan, at the end of the year.The next round of bargaining is to begin next week in Bonn.The resolution that passed  
<<the Senate>>
  today disputes a basic premise of those talks: that  
//the  first and biggest steps ought to be taken by industrial nations like the  States.//
 
<<Senator Byrd>>
  a Democrat, said  
//the  proposal offered by the Administration in the talks was  unacceptable.''//
That proposal would set binding limits on emissions of heat-trapping gases by industrial nations in the medium term, while deferring the time when developing nations would have to accept similar limits.Mr. Byrd's resolution is supported by energy producing and consuming industries, especially the coal industry, which sustains the West Virginia economy and is powerful in many other states.Industry lobbyists have argued that reducing such gases threatens their prosperity. 
<<Andrew Card>>
  president of the American Automobile Manufacturers Association, called the vote  
//''a  wake-up call to the Administration to adopt a more open and realistic approach to global  negotiations.''But//
 
<<Tim Wirth>>
  the Under Secretary of State for global environmental affairs, tried to put the best light on the situation, saying after the vote that  
//''we  support the thrust of the  resolution,''//
 and added:  
//''We  have been further out front than any country in pressing for  commitments.//
The U.S. is much more aggressive than anyone else, and this strengthens our hand.''Senators John Kerry of Massachusetts, a Democrat, and John H. Chafee of Rhode Island, a Republican, joined with Mr. Byrd in a carefully scripted colloquy on the floor during which they all seemed to agree that  
//each  country  make,//
 as  
<<Senator Byrd>>
  put it,  
//''unique  and binding contributions of a pace and kind consistent with  industrialization.//
''Mr. 
<<Byrd>>
  added,  
//''The  developing world must agree in Kyoto to adopt some manner of binding targets and commitments which would begin during the same compliance period as the developed world, in as aggressive and effective a schedule  possible.''A//
  
//scripted  discussion in a Senate debate is important because it provides a legislative history intended to clarify the intention of  resolution.//
 
<<Mr. Byrd>>
  also said his resolution  
//''accepts  the thesis, which is still the subject of  dispute,''//
 that  
//global  warming is a  problem.//
Many scientists believe the warming of the planet could cause ocean levels to rise and would severely disrupt the earth's biological systems.Such a trend is likely, they say, because increasing levels of carbon dioxide and other gases trap heat from the sun in a process similar to what happens in a greenhouse.In the colloquy,  
<<Mr. Kerry>>
  built support for the Administration's plan to  
//allow  developing and developed nations to trade credits with one another for  emissions,//
  
//a  plan intended to reduce the costs faced by industrial nations while decreasing the pollution generated by  nations.//
But the debate also highlighted strong feelings among some lawmakers against any treaty whatsoever. 
<<Senator Larry E. Craig>>
  Republican of Idaho, accused  
//President  Clinton of using his ''bully pulpit to terrorize the  people,''//
  
//and  of ''building a propaganda campaign'' to support a  treaty.//

Article no :21
Early in this decade, as the nations of the world negotiated a treaty to head off man-made global warming, industry lobbyists spoke with virtually one voice on the issue of climate change.They just said no -- no to any binding agreement obligating countries to control emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, and no to the very idea that there was serious cause for concern.But times have changed, and the industry stance has changed as well.Though hard-liners still see no need to force anyone to limit emissions of greenhouse gases, a whole new spectrum of industry voices has joined the policy debate as businesses have examined more closely how they might win or lose.At least one big crack has developed in the once-monolithic front presented by the producers of fossil fuels, like coal and oil, the very people who might be expected to hold out most strongly against any change.At meetings here, where delegates from around the globe have gathered  under the five-year-old treaty, these changes have surfaced as a more widespread willingness to accept the view of mainstream scientists that the problem is real and to take at least some action to solve it.The heads of several large corporations met with President Clinton in Washington today to discuss the problem.The President has promised a strong American proposal for specific levels of greenhouse gas reductions that is still being drawn up.In what may be the most telling change,  
<<British Petroleum>>
  the world's third-largest oil company, broke ranks with other fossil fuel producers recently and announced that  
//it  believes that there is now enough scientific evidence to warrant concern about whether human activity -- primarily the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas -- is changing  climate.//
 
//The  time to contemplate action ''is not when the link between greenhouse gases and climate change is conclusively proven, but when the possibility cannot be discounted and is  seriously,''//
  
<<John Browne>>
  
//British   Petroleum//
  
<<he>>
  said,  
//''has  reached  point.//
''Delegates to the meeting here are negotiating reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases.The most important of these is carbon dioxide, which is produced by burning fossil fuels.The negotiations will conclude in Kyoto, Japan, in December.In the conference rooms, corridors and coffee bars of the Bonn Maritim Hotel, where the talks are taking place, the spectrum of industry opinion runs from hard-liners in the coal and oil industries who want no agreement in Kyoto to companies that produce alternatives to fossil fuels and want strong action immediately.In the middle is a broad group with a range of positions. 
<<The dominant scientific view>>
  is that  
//greenhouse  gas emissions are probably responsible for at least part of a rise of 1 degree Fahrenheit in the average global temperature over the  century.//
Mainstream scientists predict that if emissions are not reduced, there will be a further rise of perhaps 3.5 degrees in the next century and more after that, with accompanying disruptions in climate.These include, for instance, more frequent and severe floods and droughts and a rise in the sea level.By comparison, the world has warmed by 5 to 9 degrees since the last ice age.There is considerable uncertainty in these estimates.Nevertheless,  
<<Mr. Browne>>
  said in a telephone interview,  
//''it  seems to us it's time we should do something'' about greenhouse  emissions.//
Just because there are uncertainties,'' he said, ''it doesn't mean you just stand still and do nothing.
Article no :21
''In that spirit, the company is formally collaborating with the Environmental Defense Fund, a private group, to test practical, market-based approaches to emission reduction.It is taking steps to control its own emissions and to develop alternative fuels and energy technologies.It is undertaking cooperative efforts to reduce emissions in developing countries.And it has assumed the rotating leadership of a broad Washington-based coalition of industry moderates on climate, many of them multinational companies. 
<<The Clinton Administration>>
  is looking to the moderates for support as part of a campaign to win public acceptance of Mr. Clinton's  
//pledge  at the United Nations in June to seek strong action  Kyoto.//
Mr. Browne was one of the chief executives who discussed the subject with the President today.Mr. Clinton's United Nations speech appears to have infused the climate debate with new zest -- and to have increased the lobbying from all points on the industry spectrum. 
//''The  status of industry has  changed,''//

  who directs the Yale University Center for Environmental Law and Policy, alluding to the period  
//since  the climate treaty was negotiated  1992,//
There was only one position in '92; today there is a flowering of industry positions.''And back then,

  said,  
//''you  didn't have a major industrial powerhouse like B.P. coming in and saying the time for action  now.//

<<Mrs. Holmes>>
  acknowledges that  
//they  consist of ''a much broader range of people, a wide spectrum  opinion.//
''The shift in outlook should not be overstated, though. 
<<Mr. Browne>>
  for instance,  
//does  not see climate change as  crisis//
 and argues that  
//there  is time to head off the problem in a deliberate, step-by-step fashion that balances economic growth and  protection.//
Any targets and timetables for emission reduction, he says, should be realistic and achievable.Further, industry is virtually unanimous in insisting that developing countries share in emission reductions.Otherwise, it fears, companies in industrialized countries will be at a competitive disadvantage.As of now, the richer countries are obligated under the treaty and subsequent international policy decisions to take the first steps.Developing countries say those first steps have not been taken, since most of the richer countries have not even been able to fulfill a voluntary pledge under the treaty to stabilize emissions at 1990 levels.Most companies and industry groups do not go as far in the direction of strong action as does an American organization called the Business Council for Sustainable Energy.Its members include several utilities -- whose leaders have found it in their interest to promote energy conservation, which reduces fossil-fuel burning and greenhouse gas emissions -- as well producers of solar power, wind power and natural gas.The last, while it is a fossil fuel, is viewed as a preferred alternative in the near term because it produces less carbon dioxide than coal or oil.This group as a whole stands to benefit from controls on greenhouse emissions since its members put a premium on the more efficient use of energy. 
<<Michael Marvin>>
  the group's executive director. said  
//''we've  got the technology right now'' to produce energy  efficiently.//
Not surprisingly, his organization favors an early stabilization of greenhouse gas emissions, by 2005, followed by progressive reductions beginning in 2010.A larger group, the Washington-based  
<<International Climate Change Partnership>>
  now under the chairmanship of British Petroleum and including a wide range of industries, accepts the existence of  
//a  scientific consensus that some measure of man-made global warming  likely.//
We think that appears to be relatively strong,'' said Kevin J. Fay, the group's executive director.But, he said, climate change is a highly complex, long-term problem that need not necessarily be attacked with immediate targets and timetables for emission reductions. 
//The  Kyoto deadline is an  one,//
  
<<he>>
  said, adding that  
//it  is more important to achieve a lasting solution that allows both environmental protection and economic growth rather than a quick ''feel  result.//
There are probably many pathways by which the objective of heading off dangerous climatic change can be achieved, he said.Still another group, consisting of electric utilities and represented by  
<<the Edison Electric Institute>>
  is  
//collaborating  with the Administration to reduce greenhouse emissions by promoting more efficient use  electricity.//
This program, the institute says, has already brought significant reductions.All of this is voluntary, and the group favors that approach in any Kyoto agreement.It also is determined to get credit for reductions already achieved as part of such an agreement.The hard-liners have not changed their position.Several of them are to be found in the Global Climate Coalition, a Washington-based lobbying group representing core energy and manufacturing industries. 
<<Gail McDonald>>
  the new president of the coalition,  
//formed  zeros with her fingers when asked what her group would like to see happen  Kyoto.//
The coalition continues to question the science of global warming.It argues that the impact of climate change is too uncertain and that the risk of economic damage is still too high to justify stronger, mandatory action. 
//The  Administration s present course toward mandatory targets and timetables is ''an unjustified rush  judgment,''//
 the coalition's chairman,  
<<William F. O'Keefe,>>
 He likened it to driving too fast in a thick fog.This, he said, ''risks a fatal crash.''
Article no :22
Following are excerpts from President Clinton's news conference today on the South Lawn of the White House, from a transcript provided by the Federal News Service, a private transcription company: OPENING REMARKSBefore I begin, let me first say that I join with all Americans in expressing our deepest condolences for the victims of the terrible plane crash yesterday in Guam.I have spoken with Governor Gutierrez, and I want to commend him, the hundreds of volunteers, and the United States military personnel who are working so hard on the response and the rescue effort.The National Transportation Safety Board will lead the investigation of the crash with technical assistance from the F.A.A. and other agencies as needed.Now, today I want to briefly review what our nation has accomplished during the first seven months of this year, and to spell out the opportunities and the obligations that we have to continue that progress.As I have said over and over again, our common mission must be to prepare our people for the 21st century, to master the challenges and seize the opportunities of this remarkable time.I believe the American people are coming to see that and coming to believe that as we pass through this period of remarkable change, the future holds far greater rewards than risks if our people, our government, and our other institutions are ready for tomorrow.In these past months, we have seen how the politics of the vital center can work to make progress on many of our most difficult problems. 
<<We>>
  ratified  
//the  Chemical Weapons Convention a landmark treaty that will protect our soldiers and our citizens from the threat of  gas.//
We reached agreement in Madrid to open the doors of NATO to Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, while creating a stronger partnership with Russia and Ukraine, to build a Europe that is undivided, democratic, and at peace.These past months have been a remarkably fruitful time for bipartisan action in the national interests, and I think we have to continue that work.I should mention, too, that we worked in a bipartisan fashion to maintain our normal trade relationships with China, reaching out to a quarter of the world's population while making our differences with the government over human rights and other matters clear.These are major accomplishments, all achieved with the support of Americans, both Democrats and Republicans.They have strengthened our nation.And yesterday, we took an historic action to eliminate the annual budget deficits we have been seeing, and piling up, since 1969. The first step toward that was taken back in 1993 when we abandoned supply-side trickle-down economics, opened a new chapter in fiscal responsibility with a new strategy of growth, based on reducing the deficit, investing in education and training, opening the world to trade and American products and services.Even before yesterday, the deficit had been reduced by over 75 percent as a result of this strategy.But yesterday, when I signed into law the first balanced-budget act in a generation, we know that it will add to the long-term economic growth potential of the United States.We know, too, that it includes the largest increase in college aid since the G.I.  Bill 50 years ago, the largest increase in children's health since Medicaid was enacted, first, over 30 years ago.Today, I have some more good news.Our efforts have led to an even lower deficit than we had previously projected.In this, the fourth year of the five-year economic plan adopted in 1993, we now expect the deficit to drop to $37 billion.Yet, without the bipartisan balanced budget we just passed, our budget officials estimate the deficit would rise next year, to $50- to $100 billion, and stay at that level for years to come.With our bipartisan balanced budget plan, we now expect it not only to reach balance by 2002, but to have a surplus in excess of $20 billion, and to be able to maintain that for several years thereafter.There are still big challenges and tough decisions that we have to make beyond the balanced budget, however, if we're going to keep our economy growing, and keep our people fully prepared for the new century.To meet that, members of Congress from both sides of the aisle and Americans from all walks of life must summon the will and spirit that led to the balanced budget.We have a lot of work to do in the rest of this year.First, if we expect to keep our economy strong and growing, we must continue to invest in the education and training of our people, and we must succeed in our push for high national standards and tests to make sure our students, our schools, and our teachers are doing the job.Second, we must tackle the tough issue of entitlement reform.We have to make tough choices to strengthen and protect Medicare and Social Security over the long run.They are the two most important social service innovations of the 20th century.This is not simply a matter of fiscal responsibility; it is also a matter of honoring the duties we owe both to our parents and to the next generation.The balanced-budget bill I signed yesterday sets up a bipartisan commission to reform Medicare.This fall, along with the members of the Congress, I will appoint the members of the commission and they will get to work.We'll also tackle other issues to strengthen our families, exploring ways to improve child care in America and continuing our efforts to reduce the use of tobacco among our children.Third, we will grow our economy and create good jobs by continuing to open more foreign markets to our goods and services -- through tough, fair trade agreements.We must continue to reach out to the more than 95 percent of the world's consumers who live beyond our borders.That is why I will ask Congress to give me fast-track authority to negotiate new trade agreements that will extend free and fair trade to keep our economy going.Fourth, it is obvious that we cannot fulfill our obligations to future generations unless we also deal responsibly with the environmental challenge of global climate change. Growing our economy need not -- indeed, it must not -- contradict our commitment to protecting the environment.When the nations of the world meet in Kyoto in December, we must all take concrete steps to address this problem.The United States must commit to realistic and binding limits on our emissions of greenhouse gases.The science demands that we act, and again, we owe it to our children.Finally, let me say, as I did in the State of the Union address, that one of our most critical pieces of unfinished business remains campaign finance reform.When Congress returns from its vacation, Senators McCain and Feingold have made clear they will bring campaign finance reform legislation to the floor of the Senate.This will be the time of testing.The special interests and their allies have killed reform year after year.But this year, the eyes of America will be on the Senate floor.I will give my strong support to McCain-Feingold, and if the American people will give their strong support, I am determined that we can prevail.It should not be as easy this year, as it has been in each of the four previous years, to kill campaign finance reform with a Senate filibuster by a minority of the Senate.This year it is very important that every American know where every single elected Federal official in Washington stands on this issue.Are you yes, or are you no?It should be clear and unambiguous, and I believe if it is, we have a chance to succeed in passing the bill.All these challenges will require bipartisan cooperation.Many of them will require difficult decisions.But this balanced budget and the prosperity we are now enjoying gives us a rare opportunity to take these steps for the long-term well-being of our country.We can meet the challenges of the 21st century.We can have higher educational standards, entitlement reform, campaign finance reform, expanding trade, and a cleaner environment.This budget agreement shows that we can do all these things when we work together to find common ground.We have to carry this spirit into the fall for the hard work ahead.QUESTIONS AND ANSWERSQ:  The United States has avoided nurturing peace for a long time in the Middle East -- a tinderbox. . . .But yet, editorially, the Washington Post says your choices are -- and if you'll permit me to read it -- says, ''Up to now, President Clinton has avoided confronting the implications of Mr. Netanyahu's reluctance to bargain territory for a Palestinian settlement.Now he must decide whether to minimize short-run frictions with the Israeli government or reach for a long-term peace.''What do you say to that?A:  Well, first of all, let me say that the Secretary of State gave a very important speech to the Press Club at noon today.I read the speech last night.I went over it with great care, and I am in full accord with what she said.Secondly, in this year alone, the United States helped to broker the Hebron agreement.We have hosted all the leaders from the Middle East here.Dennis Ross has been to the Middle East twice.We have worked very hard on this. . . .The question is not whether the United States or this administration, on any given day or week, is popular or not in any foreign capital.The question is: Are we doing what is most likely to work?And sometimes reasonable people can disagree about that. . ..I have asked Dennis Ross to go back to the region, to primarily discuss security.As Secretary Albright made clear, until the parties trust each other, and until the Israelis believe that the Palestinian Authority is making 100 percent effort, which is different from 100 percent results, but making 100 percent effort on security, it is impossible for peace to proceed. . ..Onthe substance of the peace process, the parties still have to make the final decision. But on the process itself, how to get the process going again with some integrity designed to restore confidence in both parties, I think the United States can and should offer its best ideas.And that is exactly what we intend to do. . ..Q:  Well, the point of friction has been the settlement.And do you think you have been evenhanded in that respect?A:  Well, I think we've made it clear to the Israelis that we don't think anything should be done which undermines the trust of the parties and violates either the spirit or the letter of the Oslo Accord, and which predetermines the outcome of final settlement issues under Oslo. . ..But let me say, there is no parallel between bombs and bulldozers.You cannot draw a parallel.We cannot have an environment in which people believe the way to get what they want is to kill innocent people in a marketplace.
Article no :22
Furthermore, I believe the people who are responsible for those terrorist bombs are the enemies of the Palestinian Authority as well.And I think they ought to see that.It is imperative that Mr. Arafat understand that those people are not his friends, either.Those people do not want a peace.Their closest allies in terms of political objectives may be their most extreme enemies in Israel who do not believe that peace is possible.The people that murdered all those people, those innocent civilians, are not trying to get a peace that they think is more favorable to the Palestinian and the Arab cause.They are trying to murder the peace process.And as soon as we all understand that and go back to work on it, then I think, you know, we have as chance to make progress.But I also believe that the government of Israel clearly has a responsibility to carry its end of the load, too.This has got to be a two-way street. . ..Q: The tax cut and budget bills that you signed yesterday were criticized by your own Treasury secretary as ''heavily laden with special interest provisions.''You have the power to use the line-item veto to take out some of those special-interest tax breaks.Are you planning to exercise that power?A:  Well, the short answer is that I expect there will some exercise of that.But let me tell you what we're doing.First of all, I have asked my staff and relevant Cabinet members to review both the budget bill and the tax bill. . ..Inthe tax bill, there are certain limited -- and they're quite limited -- special tax provisions that are subject to the line-item veto.In the budget bill, there are certain special spending programs under the so-called entitlement umbrella that are subject to the line-item veto.I must act on either one of them within five days from yesterday, excluding Sunday.That's what the law says.In addition to that, as the annual appropriations are passed, they too -- the spending items within the annual appropriations -- are subject to the line-item veto.So what I've asked my staff and Cabinet to do is to meet with me, first of all, make sure I am aware of the items that are subject to veto in the tax bill and in the budget bill that I signed.And then the second thing we have to do is to make absolutely sure that none of these things that we don't think are very good were part of the agreement.That is, this was an agreement entered into in good faith, and I cannot use the line-item veto on anything that our negotiators agreed to let go through.I think that's very important. . . .Then after that, we'll have a category of items, and I will just go down and evaluate them and decide whether I think that they are sufficiently objectionable that they should be vetoed.Q:  On this deficit reduction that you've just mentioned, that it's now fallen to $37 billion, doesn't it raise the question that in fact the budget could be balanced a lot sooner if you and Congress hadn't enacted $95 billion in tax cuts?A:  Well, let me say this, if we hadn't done anything, if we'd had no tax cuts and no other changes, our estimates are -- keep in mind these tax cuts are over a five-year period -- our estimates are that we would have a deficit which would rise over the next five years and stay at about the level of $100 billion.So you can also say that if we hadn't spent $24 billion on children's health care, we could balance the budget, if we abolished the spending on education we could do it. The question is, can we do this in a way that also helps the American people and gives them some of the benefit of the prosperity that has been generated in the last five years. . ..There's a lot of discussion about this tax cut.I want to make two things clear.This tax cut is a small fraction of the size of the tax cut that was adopted in '81 that started us down the road to permanent structural deficits. . ..No.2, 80 percent of this tax cut goes to three things which will benefit the vast majority of Americans: education, the child tax credit, and the initiatives to help isolated and distressed urban and rural communities. . ..Q:  What makes you believe that future Congresses will continue along the path to keep the -- to balance the budget in 2002 or to keep it balanced?And also, sir, in 1994 you referred to ''extreme Republicans who want tax cuts and spending increases and balanced budgets -- all this ridiculous stuff.''That seems to be what you got yesterday.I mean, you came here intending to stimulate the economy with government spending and to get universal health care.Why did you change your mind?A:  That's not accurate.I also said that we would cut the deficit in half in four years.We did better than I said; we cut it by 75 percent in four years. . ..I also said that I would have to eliminate programs, cut the size of government by at least 100,000, and do more things that we had -- that --I believed we could reduce the deficit and increase targeted investment. . ..There are more entitlement savings in the Medicare program in this budget than ever in any budget since Medicare's been enacted -- about $400 billion.There are new, modest fees for home health care in the Medicare premium.So, there will be -- this is not all increased spending.Some things will be increased, many things will be decreased.And if we do it, we'll produce growth. . ..I'm convinced that if we did not pass this plan, and did not say to the world and to the investor community ''we're going to balance the budget,'' it would slow economic growth. . ..Whydo I think subsequent Congresses will stay with this?Because I think that they have seen what happens if you do this, if you have fiscal responsibility and you're running a balanced budget when you have good economic times, then you get rewarded in the markets, and your economy does well.If you spend a lot of money you shouldn't be spending, and you run big deficits in good economic times, the international financial markets will punish the United States.They will drive up interest rates, they will drive down the value of our stock market, they will weaken our economy, and they will make the deficits even worse.Q:  You said that the American people should know where every political figure in Washington stands on campaign finance.Yet, at the same time that you've called for an end to soft money, you continue to raise it for your party. . ..A:  We live in a competitive world.And notwithstanding what the image may be, constantly -- and you see again in the press today -- the Republicans raise more money, raise more big money, and raise more money from non-citizens than the Democrats do. But we have to raise enough to be competitive. . ..But the lesson that we have learned is there is too much money in this system, but it's because of the cost of communication.  It's the cost of communication that's driving this up.And so we have got to get free air time or reduced air time, and we've got to get campaign finance reform. . . .Letme just say.Look at what we have done, just since the first of this year.We want the F.C.C. to deal with the issue of free air time.I have appointed an advisory committee to explore that.I have asked former Vice President Mondale and former Senator Nancy Kassebaum-Baker to head a national group to get citizens involved in campaign finance reform.I have asked the F.E.C. to reconsider the rules that it made, which made soft money possible in the first place.  And I am supporting Kennedy-Kassebaum. I don't know what else I can do. . ..Q:  You spoke of entitlement reform, but the Medicare Commission will not return its recommendations until the spring of 1999. . . .First of all, in that context, one year before the presidential elections begin, do you really believe that there will be the political will to do something drastic vis-a-vis Medicare reform?And number two, on Social Security, you've had a chance to think about this for several years now.Can you tell us what your recommendations might be in terms of keeping Social Security from going bankrupt?A:  Well, first let me -- let me deal with the Medicare issue. . . .I think that, first of all, this commission may decide to make interim recommendations and we may take a series of steps.Secondly, if they make a package recommendation at the end, and it has the support of all these appointees -- and I can assure you, I'm going to work hard to appoint distinguished, good people to this commission that will inspire confidence in our citizens -- then I think that Congress will be prepared to act on it.And I feel the same way about Social Security. . ..These systems would work for a longer period of time than they otherwise will but for the fact of the baby boom and the fact that all seniors are living longer. . . .When the baby boomers retire, because of the length of life of senior citizens, there will come a time when there will be almost only two people working, just a few more than two people working, a fraction over two, for every one person on these programs.And you asked me do I think that we will take the steps necessary to reform them.I do.And I -- I feel that for a simple reason:  No. 1 --and I'm the oldest of the baby boomers -- I don't believe that our generation wants to ask our children to make drastic sacrifices to support us because we wouldn't take modest steps now that don't have to affect the people that are now retired at all.You know, if we can deal with this over a longer period of time that -- and in ways that don't affect people who are now retired at all, or at least in a very minimal fashion -- and I think it's an intergenerational obligation, and I expect it to be fulfilled.Q:  The stock market has been soaring in recent months.Are you worried or concerned about whether ordinary Americans understand the risk involved in their investments at this time?A:  Hmm.Anything I say is wrong, right?If I say yes, the market drops tomorrow.If I say no, someday it'll drop, and I'll be a heel. . ..That increase has been accompanied by a very brisk growth in our economy and strong growth in productivity. . ..You know, all markets go up and down at various times.But I think that if you go back over the last 30 years, investments in the stock market held over the long term have panned out pretty well.And there aren't too many people of modest incomes who put a huge amount of money in the stock market on one day and then have to take it out four months from now no matter what.And, you know, I think that these mutual funds, these retirement funds, they can mix their investments, and they can do it over a longer period of time.So I think that on the whole what they're doing is betting on the larger American economy.And I think that's a very good bet.Q:  In light of the new alliance between Apple and Microsoft that was announced today I wondered if you could tell us if you're troubled at all by the phenomenal growth of the Microsoft Corporation and if you or your administration is considering putting any limits on that growth if you -- and if not, how this is different from oil and steel and the railroads in the early parts of the century.A:  I can't comment on this particular announcement today because it just happened today and its economic effects under our laws have to be analyzed.But, as you know, that Microsoft has been involved in the last -- since I've been president -- in various legal issues relating to its organization and operations.And I think, all I can tell you is we will treat them in the same way we would anyone else, and make the analysis of law that seems appropriate in the Justice Department.I have to wait to hear from them about whether there are any antitrust implications to this.Q:  Mr. President, in a civil suit filed against you, attorneys for the plaintiff have issued a subpoena for an individual who may or may not have worked in the White House.Your staff, when asked to clarify the status of that individual in the past, refuses to answer the question and refers it to an outside attorney. Even for those of us who don't have much appetite for this entire subject, this particular answer in this particular category, seems needlessly evasive. . ..A:  Well, first of all, I think the answer is probably known.But I think that Mr. Bennett and the person in question's lawyers gave the only relevant answers.And there was a request to be left alone and not harassed, and we're just trying to honor it.I don't really have anything to say -- to add to what Mr. Bennett already said about it.Q:  I want to ask a question about the U.P.S. strike.But before I do, I want to just clarify what you meant by the line-item veto, that you expect to exercise it.Do you mean between nowand Monday you expect to exercise or it, or exercise it in the fall when there are appropriations bills?A:  I mean I expect to exercise it, and I know --I am anticipating that there will be some things between now and Monday that I would want to exercise it on.But I want to emphasize this: I have not had a briefing on this, and I literally -- all I know about this is what I have read in the press, you know, about the list of tax items which are subject to the line-item veto. . ..ButI honestly don't know enough to tell you today:Here's something I'm going to veto. . ..Q:  If I could just ask on the U.P.S. strike -- there are lot of small businesses out there that are suffering right now as a result of this.And they see you standing by, encouraging both sides to go back to the bargaining table but not really doing anything about it. And some of your critics are saying that's because the labor unions supported you and the Democrats, so overwhelmingly, over these past few years.Is that a fair criticism of why you're standing aside and not----A:  No.Q:  ----getting directly involved in this strike?A:  No.Let me urge you all to do one thing, because I think it would be very helpful to people, to the American people, generally, to know this.If you compare what I did in the American Airlines strike, which is the only strike I have been involved in where -- you know, recently where I had some authority there -- the airline companies, because they take passengers, are governed by a Federal law, which gives the president the power to intervene if there is substantial economic danger or damage to the country.The U.P.S. strike with the teamsters is not covered by that law.It is covered by the Taft-Hartley Act.If you look at the Taft-Hartley Act, there has to be a severe damage to the country.The test is very different and very high before the President can intervene. . ..I'm very concerned about all the customers and users of U.P.S. and what's happening to them.But I do not believe that it is a fair reading of the Taft-Hartley law, which is the law I have to act under, that the high standard of that law has been met. . ..Q:  You also put into law yesterday, of course, with the tax and budget provisions, was the District of Columbia rescue plan and there's an extraordinary amount of roiling around and criticism in the city and I think around -- perhaps around the country about what's taken to be a trampling of home rule for this nation's capital city as democracy advances in the rest of the world, some folks are worried that it may be receding here and the fact that Mayor Barry's powers have been reduced to a certain extent as an un-elected control board comes in to make these management reforms and deal with the aid.And there are some that think that this may be an attack on Mr. Barry personally, that this is in the legislation.Are you concerned about this to the extent that you're going to try to do anything to follow up on it, talk to Ms. Norton.I wonder what reaction would be?A:  Well, first of all, we've already been in touch with Congresswoman Norton about this in some detail.Let me back up and say that I think on balance the legislation was very good for the District of Columbia because it will have the affect of injecting about $200 million in cash into the city this year.As the state -- the federal government pays a higher share of the Medicare budget of D.C., it begins to take over the prisons, it begins to assume the pension liabilities, what I was hoping to do was to remove from the District of Columbia the burdens that normally are borne by a state but that this city has had to bear, and then to give the local officials more responsibility for the things that a city must do: run a good school system, keep the streets safe, repair the roads and the highways and the streets, and do the other things that the city has to do.And the Congress simultaneously wanted to strengthen the whole reform system that was represented by the control board.And it was a congressional initiative and, if you will, a condition of getting the financial relief that the provisions that you mentioned were adopted which, among other things, require a joint agreement of new department heads between the Mayor and the head of the control board. . ..FrankRaines, as all of you know, is representing me in our D.C. negotiations. I've asked him to try to get together with the parties and see if we can find a way to make these appointments consistent with home rule, and that if he finds the situation to be untenable, to come back to me with some suggestions about what we should do then. . ..There are some very interesting tax provisions in this bill, which are similar to the tax credits that we gave generally around the country for people to hire people off welfare, for people who would go into the inner cities in the high-poverty areas.And then there is, for the first time ever, a zero capital gains on people who start trade or businesses in high-poverty areas of D.C.So we are trying to rebuild the economic infrastructure of the city as well. . ..Q:  You wanted a dialogue on race, and you have a dialogue on race right now, the black-white issue, and particularly the issue of an apology for slavery, and reparations.Are you hoping that the issue were to go away by giving it to the race advisory board?Because there is word that you would like it to go away.A:  I don't know that I hope the issue will go away.What I hope the issue -- what I hope will happen is that the issue will not dominate all the other things that need to be discussed about the past, the present, and the future. . ..There will be dialogue.There will be research and studies done.And there will be policies flowing.And you know, I've already announced the first major policy under this initiative, which is the $250 million program to give people -- to defray the cost of college education for people who will teach in under-served areas.Q:  When this administration calls on the Palestinian Authority to take sustained action to prevent terrorism, what specific steps are you looking for?And secondly, do you personally believe that Yasir Arafat and the Palestinian Authority have fulfilled the obligation to prevent terrorism?A:  Let me answer them in order.No. 1, we expect them to resume meaningful, real, consistent security cooperation with the Israeli authorities in the way that they do when they work best.No. 2, we expect them to act on the information that they have.You can't hold them to the information that they don't.But they have proven in the past quite effective at rounding up people and arresting them for good cause.And No. 3, we expect that if there are people there who are really serious threats to the peace and to innocent civilians, they should be kept behind bars, if it is legal to do so. . ..In answer to your second question, I would have to say that I could not say that there has been constant, 100 percent effort. . . .But I know that it's been discouraging for the Palestinian Authority.I know they get frustrated.I know that sometimes Mr. Arafat feels like he's caught in the middle, between his own population and their discontents and frustration, and his frustrations in dealing with the Israeli government.But none of that can be an excuse for not maintaining security.If you go back and read Oslo, they promised 100 percent effort on security; No. 1.No. 2, never mind Oslo, you can't have a civilized society if you permit terrorism.And No. 3, in the end, the terrorists are the enemy of moderate, constitutional government among the Palestinians. . ..Q:  You have repeatedly expressed your admiration and support for Governor Weld.But how far are you willing to go to see him confirmed? . ..A:  I believe that Governor Weld would be a good ambassador to Mexico and is rather uniquely situated to be a good ambassador to Mexico because of his background, his experience, his knowledge, because he does know a lot about the drug trafficking and he's been criticized for that. . . .I think at least the man ought to get a hearing and ought to get his day in court, if you will, his day before the committee.And I was encouraged to hear Senator Lugar say that.We've got a team organized in the White House to try to help promote his nomination. And we'll do the very best we can.And we'll see what happens.But I believe he ought to be the ambassador, and I'm going to try to see him confirmed.Q:  In many of the nursing homes owned by corporates there are very few small staffs for a very large number of patients and the staff are paid very little, therefore they take it out on the patients.And some of these patients and many of them are hungry and they're abused and they're mistreated and nationally we ought to do something about it.I'm sure you can.A:  Well, let me say, there are two issues here really in terms of what happens to older people who are not living at home and to some extent in home.There's the nursing home situation, there's the people who are living in institutions that aren't quite nursing homes, and then there are people who are getting home care and the question of whether the home cared are getting actually is what they contracted for and whether they're being properly paid.The Department of Health and Human Services is looking at the question of whether we can streamline and make more effective the regulation of nursing homes and also how we're going to go about getting money stopping spending money in other forms of support for seniors where the money basically is being ripped off through fraud and abuse.And I hope that, over the next few weeks, we will have something to say about that, that will reassure people and their families who are in nursing homes.Q:  Another line-item veto question.You said that some of these candidates for a veto were negotiated in good faith, they're part of the agreement.Could you explain to the American people why a tax cut that benefits 100 or fewer taxpayers is ever in the national interest?It sounds like the very definition of a ''special-interest goodie.''A: Well, it's certainly the definition of a ''special-interest group,'' but not all special interests are always in conflict with the general interest.If that were true, our country would not have survived for over 200 years.But I want to look at them and see, because you say that anything that benefits a hundred or fewer taxpayers must, by definition, be a special interest.But it could be a sector of the economy where there are fewer than a hundred businesses now, where there is a national interest in keeping a certain activity going; alternative -- or something that's good for the environment, for example.I don't know.I don't want to comment because I have not seen these.But I would think that there are cases -- for example, there may be a case where an injustice was done to a taxpayer, or a small class of taxpayers, and we are trying to fix that.There may be a -- or -- and that's the one case I can think of -- the other case is where there'd be fewer than a hundred firms in a given economic area where we'd want to do something.Q:  A minute ago, in talking about campaign finance reform, you said I will live under any set of rules that are there.But violations of the rules that are in place -- or apparent violations, exactly why there are Thompson hearings in the Senate, why your own Justice Department has an investigation going.Why don't you appeal to two people who are trying to help you, Charlie Trie and John Huang, to come and tell their story?They've begun to talk to ABC And other media.You make an appeal to them to come and tell what they did, and why they did it, and help move past the investigations that are there now?A:  Well, first of all, the -- I have encouraged, and I will do it again now.I've said I think everybody ought to work out a way to cooperate with this committee, and to get all the information out.Secondly, the State Department specifically has tried to work with the congressional committees, with regard to anybody who might be out of this country.So, I don't know what else we can do on that.And I certainly have been fully cooperative, and will continue to do so.But what have we learned in these hearings?We've learned that there were problems.We've learned that -- now we've learned both parties had problems.We've learned that a lot of money was raised, and a lot of money that was spent.And I hope we've also learned that a lot of what was legal -- and that was the import of Allison's question earlier.I hope we've also learned that a lot of what is legal would be better off if it didn't happen.We'd be better off if we had ceilings on contributions to the political parties. We'd be better off if somebody couldn't give a million dollars to a political party at one pop.And that all leads you back to the same place; we either will or we won't pass a credible campaign finance reform bill this year.Some people would be for it, and some people will be against it.If the public is permitted to think for a moment that they're all the sameand they're all doing it and nobody really wants it, then that is an absolute, lock-down guarantee that no bill will pass.There must be a clear distinction between those who are for and those who are against.And until there is in the public mind, people won't think they're going to be held accountable for that vote, and those who benefit from the present system will do what they can to keep it.Q:  The American Bar Association is considering recommendations to limit the independent counsel statute in their annual meeting in San Francisco this week, a series of recommendations including limiting what offices can be investigated, and the elimination of the need for a final report.First of all, where do you stand on these recommendations?And second of all, in 1999, if this statute were reauthorized, would you veto it?A:  Well, I think -- let me say first of all, the American Bar Association has taken a great interest in this, and ought to be viewed as a little bit, at least, of a neutral observer here.And they have pointed out some abuses of the law that are general, and some abuses of the law that are specific to certain specific independent counsels.And I think that in this case, I ought to be like the rest of the country; I ought to wait for their recommendations and study them. I can't comment on their recommendations till I know what they are and what the grounding is.But I'll be eager to hear them.Q:  On tobacco, there were news accounts this week that you plan to take some additional smoking steps pertaining to Federal property.In the coming months and coming year, do you plan to be active on some of the international issues as U.S. companies emphasize sales abroad; things like the World Health Organization's idea for some standards on labeling, or there have been bills introduced in Congress that would prohibit U.S. employees from promoting the export of tobacco products.A:  Well, I think that there may be some multilateral actions that we would want to be a part of.And to be honest with you, I haven't had a great deal of time to think about it.I know that sales have been declining in the United States and in Latin America, and going up in Asia and in Eastern Europe, and that it's natural to expect that the companies will try to, you know, accelerate the growing markets.And I, you know, I, if they're dangerous to children here, they're dangerous to children there.What I'm focused on now is completing my evaluation of this proposed settlement, protecting the jurisdiction of the F.D.A. and the victories we've already won, and continuing to advance the health interests of the American people.But it is inevitable -- it is as inevitable as the sun coming out today that international institutions will be called upon and nations will be called upon to responsibly deal with this.Q:  Next week, India will celebrate 50 years of independence, and you have been invited by New Delhi and also by the Indian community in Washington to attend the functions.Are you going to one of the functions? Also, how do you view the last 50 years of U.S. and India relations, the world's largest two democracies, under your administration?A:  Well, first, I hope to do something here in Washington to recognize the beginning of what will be a yearlong celebration of Indian independence. . . .There'll be some overlap in when Pakistan will be celebrating its 50th year of independence.And, you know, it's not a very hot issue here in the United States, but it's a source of continuing concern to me that the people of Pakistan and the people of India have not been able to work through their differences, because if they could do so, I'm convinced that they could quickly begin to enjoy economic growth rates at the level of the highest East Asian communities and be our best partners for the future.So I'm hoping that not only can we observe India's anniversary, but that we can be an even better friend in the next 50 years and a more constructive supporter of resolving these difficulties in the near term.Thank you.CLINTONON THE ISSUES
Article no :23
AS time grows short in the latest and most serious attempt to deal with the prospect of global warming, everyone is waiting for two decisive players -- the United States and Japan -- to get their acts together.Last week in Bonn, negotiators representing 145 countries inched closer to what would be the first international agreement on legally binding reductions in emissions of waste industrial gases, like carbon dioxide, that trap heat in the atmosphere. Mainstream scientists say these greenhouse gases threaten to disrupt the earth's climate and may already be doing so.But with only one more session scheduled in the two-year-old talks before a final meeting in Kyoto, Japan, in December, both the United States and Japan have yet to produce their proposals for specific reductions and timetables.Until they do, negotiators here said, no breakthrough is possible. 
//Japanese  and American proposals are ''the key to the success of  process,''//
  
<<Raul Estrada-Oyuela>>
 Japan is seen as a pivotal nation because of its economic strength and because, as host of the final session, it will be in a special position to influence the outcome of the talks.The United States, by virtue of its economic weight, international influence and huge emissions of greenhouse gases, is the 900-pound gorilla of international climate politics. 
//''Without  the U.S., nothing will happen -- it is  crucial,''//
 said  
<<Bert Metz>>
 It may be that nothing will happen anyway.The complexities, economic stakes and rival interests at play in the talks are such that few would express surprise if they failed to produce a meaningful agreement. But leaders of major countries have become personally engaged in the issue, infusing it with new bite and raising it to a new level of relevance and visibility. 
<<President Clinton>>
  says that  
//he  finds the scientific evidence for the fact of climate change  compelling.''//
He supports legally binding but ''realistic'' emissions reductions.  He has opened a campaign to rally popular support for what could be unpopular steps to reduce the burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil, the main source of carbon dioxide emissions.But the United States has yet to propose any amounts by which emissions should be reduced or to say when limits should take effect.Until it puts numbers on the table, the nature and strength of the American commitment are impossible to judge.American negotiators in Bonn told a number of major countries privately that  
<<Mr. Clinton>>
  was strongly committed to  
//binding  action and that his Government was working intensively to complete the specifics of  proposal,//
The American delegates also told their counterparts that any agreement acceptable to the United States must maintain economic growth, the official said.The Administration is widely expected to announce its proposal after a scheduled White House conference on climate in early October and before or during the next negotiation session here, from Oct. 20 to Oct. 31.Toshiaki Tanabe, the chief Japanese delegate in Bonn, acknowledged the concern about his country and the United States.Like the Americans, he said in an interview, Japan is ''still in the process of working out our figures.''He did not say when they would be ready.While the talks go on, lobbying and debate intensify.On one extreme are representatives of industries that produce fossil fuels, who argue that cutting emissions will hurt economies.It is better, they say, to study  global warming more to be sure that the remedy matches the threat rather than rush to judgment.On the other end of the spectrum are environmentalists who say that every year that passes without action will make climatic disruption more likely, more serious and more painful to deal with in the end.Unless a first step is taken now, they say, it might be years before the opportunity comes again, and by then climatic disruption might be obvious to all.The most influential reduction proposal on the table so far is that of  
<<the European Union>>
  which calls for  
//industrialized  countries to cut their emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide (all greenhouse gases) by 15 percent by 2010 and by 7.5 percent  2005.//
No reduction targets and timetables for developing countries are being formally discussed in Bonn.  Those countries have a general obligation, under a 1992 climate treaty signed in Rio de Janeiro, to reduce their emissions.But a conference of parties to the treaty that met in Berlin in 1995 expressly exempted the poorer countries from any new, more specific commitments in the present talks.The poorer nations have long insisted that since the industrialized countries got rich by burning fossil fuels, developing countries should not be unfairly penalized as they build their own industries.The issue of the developing countries' role may be the thorniest in the talks, and many insiders believe that it has the most potential to scuttle them.Both the Clinton Administration and the United States Senate, which must ratify any Kyoto deal, are insisting that all countries must play some role in reducing emissions.Otherwise, it is feared, some American industries might move their operations to developing countries if those countries had no similar emissions controls. 
<<The 1992 treaty,>>
  ratified by the Senate included an important compromise on principle:  
//Since  the rich countries have emitted the most greenhouse gases so far, they should take the lead in  emissions.//
But the developing countries' emissions are expected to equal or surpass those of the richer nations after 2010 or so, and it was always expected that the developing countries would follow the lead of the developed nations -- once it was clear that they were indeed moving.That evidence has not yet appeared.First, the rich countries have generally failed to cap their emissions at 1990 levels voluntarily, as the treaty says they must aim to do. Only two large countries, Germany and Britain, are succeeding at that. And there is that lack of concrete new proposals from the United States and Japan.There are a number of ways the developing countries might participate.Their targets and timetables need not be the same as that of the rich countries, for example, and their adoption could be contingent on the rich countries' adoption of their own targets and schedules.Or a rich country could get credit for some emissions reductions by providing money or technology to help a developing country reduce its emissions. That would cut the cost of the reductions, and since the gases, once emitted, quickly become part of a single, global concentration, it does not matter where the reductions come from.The United States favors this ''joint implementation'' approach but, over all, developing countries are skeptical.Still, the idea is already being tested in pilot projects, although no emissions-reduction credit is yet being awarded to rich countries for undertaking them.At the meeting here, representatives of developing countries, citing recent studies, said they were already doing more than expected to control emissions. 
//As  for binding new commitments for the poorer nations, ''one should not take on something he is not able  deliver,''//
 said  
<<Mark J. Mwandosya>>
 But he did not rule anything in or out, saying he ''wouldn't like to prejudge Kyoto,'' where the developing-country issue is expected to be decided -- or not.As for the industrialized countries,  
<<Mr. Estrada>>
  said he  
//hoped  to have an agreement on their reduction commitments nailed down by the end of the next Bonn session  October//
Achieving that agreement is not merely a matter of setting reduction targets and timetables.Both the Americans and the Japanese, for instance, believe that the structure within which the reductions would take place is just as important.They want countries to have the flexibility  to achieve reductions in ways that make the best sense for themselves, and at the least cost.The United States, for instance, has proposed that reductions be carried out over a series of multiyear  periods, with the reduction targets  expressed as an annual average of emissions for each period as a whole. It also advocates the ''banking'' of emissions reductions: applying reductions achieved in one period  against the next, and ''borrowing'' from a future period -- at a penalty -- to meet the current period's targets.The United States further proposes an arrangement called ''emissions trading.''In this approach, countries that find it difficult and expensive to reduce their emissions could purchase a permit to emit more than they are allowed from countries that find it less costly and easier.The price of the permits would be determined by supply and demand in an open market.The rationale is that in the long run, and over all, emissions reductions would be both cheaper and more effective.In another idea on the table, some countries favor tailoring emissions reductions and the means of achieving them to a country's individual economic and energy profile, rather than imposing a flat-rate, one-size-fits-all target and a fixed set of methods.There would presumably be an overall reduction target, and countries would negotiate how much of it they would be responsible for.
Article no :23
The European Union has devised an internal arrangement similar to this for its members, with countries like Britain and Germany taking on bigger reduction burdens than others.But for now, the world is looking to the United States and Japan to take their stands. ''When we have those two proposals,'' Mr. Estrada said,  ''the other pieces will fall into place.''Warming WorldBetween now and December, when representatives of most nations will meet in Japan to discuss limits on greenhouse gases, The Times will examine the science, politics and economics of climate change.
Article no :24
WITH the nations of the world counting down to a Dec. 10 deadline for negotiating cuts in emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases that many scientists say are altering the earth's climate, a fundamental question continues to pervade the debate: Just how urgent is the problem of climate change?The problem has often been perceived as lying off in the dim future  -- a century away, say, since that is the time scale on which most analysis of the question has been based.It can be very hard to get excited about something that seems so remote. ''
Article no :24
We see the train coming,'' President Clinton said not long ago, ''but most ordinary Americans in their day-to-day lives can't hear the whistle blowing.''Mainstream scientists say that the whistle is getting louder all the time,  that many signs of a changing climate are already evident.On the night of Aug. 20 and 21, for instance, a cloudburst poured up to nine inches of rain on New Jersey in three hours.  No conclusions about climate change can be drawn from a single downpour.But it provided one more data point in what Government scientists say is a clear trend in the United States: heavy rainstorms have become more common, making damaging floods more likely, and over all it is raining more than it used to.Other parts of the world have also experienced increases in precipitation in this century.And while the trend's association with global warming is not yet firmly nailed down, mainstream scientists say it is precisely, and unsurprisingly, what would be expected as the earth's atmosphere heats up.The average surface temperature of the globe has risen by about 1 degree Fahrenheit in the 20th century, and about half a degree in the last 40 years -- with temperatures generally rising more the farther away one gets from the Equator.A warmer atmosphere sucks up more water from the oceans and in general makes more moisture available to developing storms.Observations show that atmospheric water vapor has increased.Therefore, the scientists say, global warming may well be revving up the planet's rainmaking machine.A rainier world is just one of several climatic changes already observed that are associated with the warming, scientists say.Temperatures have risen more at night than in the day, portending milder winter evenings but also more deadly heat waves.Experts, for instance, attributed the record death toll in Chicago's 1995 heat wave mainly to a combination of unusually high nighttime temperature and humidity.The area of the Northern Hemisphere covered by snow has generally declined in the last 25 years.Mountain glaciers have receded in many areas.Sea level has risen as warmth has caused the water to expand. Spring comes earlier and fall arrives later in Northern latitudes, which have become about 10 percent greener. 
//''The  climate reality is that if you look out your window, part of what you see in terms of the weather is produced  ourselves,''//
 said  
<<Thomas R. Karl>>
 If you look out the window 50 years from now, we're going to be responsible for more of it.''Mr.Karl has not been known as a doomsayer on the question of global warming.It was he and his colleagues who analyzed 20th-century climatic data for the United States and southern Canada and found that both overall precipitation and the frequency of intense rainstorms and snowstorms had, on average, increased by about 10 percent over the century.Intense storms were defined as those in the top 10 percent, in terms of the amount of precipitation delivered, at the start of the century. 
//The   trend,//
 said  
<<Mr. Karl>>
   
//is  consistent with what would be expected in a world made warmer by greenhouse gases -- principally carbon dioxide, which is produced by the burning of coal, oil and  gas.//
This is only the beginning, if a panel of more than 2,000 scientists advising the world's governments is right.While no one is predicting apocalypse any time soon, the scientists' best estimate is that the world will warm by more than another half degree in the next 20 years if greenhouse emissions are not reduced (although the underlying trend would surely be modified from time to time by natural climatic variations). 
//With  another half degree of warming, the average global temperature would approach the highest experienced in the 10,000 years since the last  age,//
 said  
<<Dr. Thomas J. Crowley>>
 A century from now, according to the scientific panel's best estimate, the earth's surface will be some 3.5 degrees warmer than in 1990. '' 
//You  have to go back millions of years to find global temperatures  that,''//
 said  
<<Dr. Crowley>>
 By way of comparison, it was 5 to 9 degrees colder in the depths of the last ice age.The panel predicted that the warming would bring widespread climatic, environmental and economic dislocation.Some benefits are expected to result, including longer growing seasons in Northern Hemisphere breadbaskets and more robust plant growth stimulated by increased carbon dioxide.But many effects would be adverse, including intensified cycling of water through the ocean-atmosphere system that would result in both more frequent and severe floods and droughts; it would rain harder but things would dry out more and faster between storms.Sea level is expected to rise by about a foot and a half, inundating many low-lying coastlines.Climatic zones would shift away from the Equator, upsetting natural ecosystems.Entire forest types might disappear.Agriculture in some parts of the world, especially Africa, might be devastated.The geographical range of tropical diseases would expand.Not all scientists agree with Mr. Karl and the international scientific panel, and the disagreement is symptomatic of a more general, nagging uncertainty that plagues all efforts to gauge the urgency of the climate problem.The uncertainty also complicates the task of negotiators from around the world as they struggle to determine how much and how rapidly greenhouse gas emissions should be cut.The negotiators' next session is in Bonn in late October, with a final session in Kyoto, Japan, in the first 10 days in December.''Yes,  
//there  have been these big climate changes, but I think they're  natural,''//
 said  
<<Dr. William M. Gray>>
  a climatologist at Colorado State University in Fort Collins who has been  
//skeptical  that greenhouse gases are altering  climate.//
I respect Tom Karl a lot, but I don't agree with his interpretation of his data.''Another skeptic,  
<<Dr. Richard S. Lindzen>>
  of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, says that  
//the  natural system has  resilience//
 --  
//''it  has to wobble  bit''//
 -- and that  
//the  observed changes are an expression  this.//
Since he  
//believes  that global warming is expected to amount  little,//
  
<<Dr. Lindzen>>
   
//believes  there is little or  urgency.//
The potential Achilles' heel in the mainstream scientists' projections of future climate is that they are based on computerized models of the atmosphere's response to estimates of future greenhouse gas emissions. Everyone agrees that  
//the  models  imperfect,//
 and  
<<Dr. Lindzen>>
  goes so far as to  
//liken  them to  boards,//
In any case, they say, there is no other way to even begin to cope with the atmosphere's complexities.

<<The international panel of scientists,>>
  which was established by the United Nations and is called the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, relied heavily on the models in rendering its landmark judgment, two years ago, that  
//''the  balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on  climate.''//
 The cautiously phrased statement, a compromise product of intense discussions, was a watershed in the climate debate because until then the panel had always said the observed warming and attendant climate changes could have been a result of natural variability.Since then, some opponents of action to cut greenhouse gases have seized on an article in the May 16 issue of the journal Science, which dealt with uncertainties surrounding the panel's conclusion that humans are probably altering the climate, to suggest that the uncertainty has grown.But that is disputed by the chief author of the intergovernmental panel's chapter on detection of human influence on climate.The scientist,  
<<Dr. Benjamin D. Santer>>
  of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, who was quoted in the Science article, said in a recent interview that  
//further  studies have not only reinforced the original conclusion, but might even  it.//
And in a recent open letter, he said that despite large uncertainties, ''the question is not whether, but rather to what extent'' greenhouse gases are influencing the climate.The best evidence, he wrote, ''suggests that the human component of climate change is not trivially small.''The size of that component remains, perhaps, the major uncertainty in gauging how urgent the climate change problem is.But if the intergovernmental panel is right, the average global surface temperature will rise by about a third of a degree Fahrenheit per decade over the next century if greenhouse gases are not reduced.Many scientists believe that no matter what action is taken in Kyoto, some substantial measure of future warming is already assured. 
//''We  haven't seen the full ramifications'' of the greenhouse gases  emitted,//

<<Dr. Kevin Trenberth>>
 The reason is that built-in inertia, mainly stemming from a drag on heating exerted by the oceans, prevents the climate system from reacting immediately to the emissions. 
//Only  about half the warming potential of greenhouse gases already in the atmosphere has  realized,//
 said  
<<Dr. James E. Hansen>>
 What this means, he said, is that even if greenhouse gas emissions suddenly ceased today, ''you'd get a few tenths of a degree'' of global warming in the next quarter century.But emissions are not going to cease now, since any policy adopted in Kyoto would require some time to have any appreciable effect.This means that atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases would continue to grow. ''You can't turn that off'' right away, said Dr. Trenberth.  He noted that even if emissions were reduced to 1990 levels -- a target that most industrialized nations are already failing to meet -- atmospheric concentrations would continue to rise indefinitely.This is because the 1990 levels were already so high. 
<<Dr. Hansen>>
  says that  
//''what  we do now is not going to have much influence on climate change in the next couple of decades; the main impact of changes we make now will be 50 and 100  downstream.''//
Consequently, he believes, climatic change is going to become ''more apparent over the next decade or so.'' 
<<Dr. Hansen>>
  has long been a firm adherent of the view that  
//greenhouse  gases are the major cause of the  warming.//
Some scientists, while convinced that humans are changing the climate in important ways and that greenhouse warming is a serious issue, believe that taking no action now would have little appreciable climatic effect.One is  
<<Dr. Tom Wigley>>
  of the National Center for Atmospheric Research, who said,  
//''Just  from a pure climate point of view, another 20 years of doing nothing is unlikely to mess  up.''//
He acknowledged that many experts would not agree, and quickly added, ''I'm not saying we should do nothing for 20 years.''For one thing, he said, ''the longer we delay, then the more we have to do later.''How much to do now is the crux of the discussions that will culminate in Kyoto.The decision is complicated by the fact that while the intergovernmental panel estimated a 3.5-degree increase in average global temperature by 2100, it also said the increase could be as low as 2 degrees and as high as 6.This poses a dilemma, in the view of Dr. Michael E. Schlesinger, a climatologist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign:If the warming is on the low end of the panel's estimate and the Kyoto delegates decide to do too much, it will be too costly to the world economy.But if it is on the high end and they decide to do too little, climatic damage will be too high and it will still be too costly.What should governments do? '' 
//We  should not do nothing and hope for the best;  crazy,''//
  
<<Dr. Schlesinger>>
 On the other hand, we shouldn't do everything, either; we don't want to squander resources on something that might turn out to be a nonproblem.''He and others call for an adaptive strategy in which at least some action is taken now, and then both the climatic effects and the economic cost of acting are periodically reassessed.Mid-course corrections would be made as needed.This principle is, in fact, built into the 1992 Rio treaty on climate change, under which the present negotiations are proceeding.But then a further difficulty arises, in Dr. Schlesinger's view.Since the effects of any emissions reductions undertaken now would not be apparent in the next two decades, it would be impossible to tell for some time whether the right thing was done. And if the reductions did subsequently succeed in mitigating the warming, that very fact would make it harder to know how serious the warming would otherwise have been, and therefore what further action might or might not be needed.''That,'' said Dr. Schlesinger, ''is what's so difficult about this cockamamie problem.''THE WARMING WORLD:Coping With Climate Change
Article no :25
THE blame for the global temperature rise in the last century is often laid on civilization and its genius for generating clouds of greenhouse gases that trap sunlight in the atmosphere.But another possible culprit is fast emerging.For centuries, scientists have known that the Sun is less steady than sunbathing and casual observation suggest.It has seasons and storms and rhythms of activity, its sunspots and flares appearing in cycles roughly 11 years long.But only in the last decade or so have these and other kinds of solar variations begun to be tied to climate shifts on Earth -- first tenuously, and more solidly of late.Today, a growing  
<<number of scientists>>
  contend that  
//the  Sun s fickleness might rival human pollution as a factor in  change.//
And  
<<some research,>>
  though sketchy and much debated, suggests that  
//the  Sun s variability could account for virtually all of the global warming measured  date.//
Other experts dismiss the possibility of such an influence, even while saying the solar factor should be studied more thoroughly.The Sun is now approaching a stormy period in its 11-year cycle, promising a wealth of new data (and possibly hot weather) that might help answer the riddle.In recent years, Sun-Earth climate detectives have focused mainly on discovering statistical links between things like long-term fluctuations in the world's temperature and the sunspot cycle's length, which varies from 8 to 15 years and averages 11 years.Those links are now seen as firm.Increasingly, scientists are trying to pin down the  physical mechanisms that might be at work.This is considered a crucial step because correlations can occur by chance, as is perhaps the case with crimes of violence and the phases of the Moon.But if scientists can discover a ''why'' that links the phenomena, they may be able to turn speculation into verifiable fact.Experts are now scrutinizing three solar variables as likely agents of terrestrial change: the Sun's overall brightness, which is seen as affecting temperatures; the Sun's ultraviolet rays, which are seen as affecting winds and ozone production high in the atmosphere, and the Sun's storms of magnetic fields and subatomic particles, which are seen as affecting rainfall and the amount of cloud cover. 
//Many  pieces of  puzzle,//
 said  
<<Dr. Brian A. Tinsley>>
  an atmospheric physicist at the University of Texas who works on the problem,  
//are  rapidly being ''fitted together to suggest a  picture.''Dr.//
 
<<Sallie L. Baliunas>>
  an astrophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass., said  
//the  breakthrough insight might occur tomorrow ''or we could struggle  decades.''//
She added: ''It's maddening.I wish I had a crystal ball.''Interest in the field is rising fast. At its next annual meeting, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the world's largest general scientific society, is holding a session entitled ''New Frontiers in the Sun-Earth Connection.''Experts say much of the ferment derives from a rush of physicists, astronomers and astrophysicists onto turf customarily trod by meteorologists and atmospheric scientists.In the past, such interdisciplinary forays have been quite fruitful, as when geologists and astronomers seized on cosmic bombardments to explain mass extinctions on Earth over the ages, going far beyond the theorizing of paleontologists. 
//''A  lot more people are crossing lines, and that's  healthy,''//
  
<<Dr. Albert Arking>>
 Scientists are ''looking over each other's shoulders instead of putting on blinders,'' he added. ''That's tremendous.It's providing new insights.''The central fact that commands the attention of all scientists investigating climate change is that average global temperatures appear to be rising gradually, going up roughly one degreeFahrenheit between 1880 and the present.The question is why.Most mainstream scientists say they are unsure about how much of the observed warming is due to natural causes and how much stems from human activities.Conventional wisdom points to a significant role for heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide, which is a natural part of the atmosphere but is also emitted by cars, factories and the burning of oil, coal and wood around the globe.Levels of this and other greenhouse gases are rising and are thought to be warming the planet by trapping sunlight that otherwise would be reflected back into space.Heeding this logic, the nations of the world are to meet in December in Kyoto, Japan, to try to negotiate cuts in emissions of the heat-trapping gases.Not surprisingly, given the sketchiness of the science and the political difficulty of trying to curb industrial growth, debate is rising on whether such cuts are warranted.Some experts contend that the majority of the century's warming occurred before 1940 and that most of the gas buildup occurred after that.  Thus, they argue, only part of the temperature rise -- perhaps a small part -- can be attributed to human activity.Clues to the Sun's effect on climate can be found in the many intriguing links between terrestrial shifts and solar activity.For instance, the snow layers of glaciers show curious variations in dust and chemical residues that appear to echo the solar cycle, as do records of tree growth and storm paths.The biggest correlation of all occurred centuries ago, when the number of sunspots fell sharply between 1640 and 1720 and the Earth cooled about two degrees Fahrenheit.Northern Europe was hit especially hard, as its glaciers and winters lengthened.At first, this chill made no sense to modern science.After all, sunspots are magnetic darkenings of the Sun whose temperatures are relatively low.It would seem that their disappearance for almost a century would mark a time of greater solar brightness and thus, if anything, higher temperatures on Earth, not the reverse.The mystery began to lift in the late 1970's as satellites started to fly above the obscuring atmosphere to study the Sun directly.A decade later, the verdict was in.Contrary to intuition, the Sun was found to be brighter when sunspots abounded and dimmer when they vanished.The reason was simple, at least in retrospect.It turned out that bright patches known as faculae, which accompany sunspots in the 11-year solar cycle, overpower the dimming effect of the dark blemishes.This brightening of the Sun has now been observed twice by satellite, and all the evidence suggests that the rhythm is ancient and variable.The discovery toppled centuries of assumptions about the Sun's steadiness and overturned the modern dogma that its radiated energy represents a ''solar constant.''It also led scientists to study how the variable brightness might affect the Earth. 
//''We  figure half the climate change from 1850 to now can be accounted for by  Sun//
 '' said  
<<Dr. Judith Lean>>
 She and her colleagues seek out historical temperature records to probe the likelihood that fluctuations in solar brightness heat and cool the Earth directly.Others say this mechanism is stronger. 
<<Dr. Baliunas>>
  of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center, and her co-workers studied records of the past 120 years and found  
//the  Sun responsible for up to 71 percent of the Earth's  shifts.//
When other factors were added to their research model, that figure rose to 94 percent.Many experts say that is too high.They note that the Sun's overall radiance appears to ebb by only about one-tenth of 1 percent during the solar cycle -- which is too small to account for dramatic change on Earth, at least by direct heating.So investigators are looking elsewhere.One suspect mechanism focuses on sunlight in the ultraviolet range.Short, potent and invisible, these rays account for most of the brightness change and have significant effects on Earth in addition to direct heating.For instance, ultraviolet rays that strike the upper atmosphere break apart molecular oxygen (O2 ) to form ozone (O3 ), a three-atom type of oxygen that has wide atmospheric repercussions. 
<<Dr. Joanna D. Haigh>>
  of Imperial College in London has found that  
//increases  in heat and ozone at solar maximums might account not only for temperature shifts but for changes in the paths of  storms.//
Her study predicted that storms sweeping across the Mediterranean would move northward, on average, about 400 miles during a solar maximum, a shift that would be consistent with observed changes in real weather patterns.As with direct heating, however, the ultraviolet mechanism is often found wanting. 
//The  predicted effects ''are still not quite as large as the observed changes'' on Earth during the ups and downs of the  cycle,//
  
<<Dr. Alan Robock>>
 Another possible mechanism is not light from the Sun but rather its winds of particles and magnetic fields, which change dramatically in strength during the solar cycle.On Earth, the solar wind is well known to produce the aurora borealis, or northern lights.When it is blowing strong, it can also cause transformers at power plants to burst into flames, radio communications to fail and satellites to stop working or even fall from the sky.Now the solar wind is getting increased attention as a possible engine of climate change, since its severity appears responsible for a number of terrestrial shifts on time scales from days to centuries.The envisioned mechanism is indirect but intriguing.During peaks of the solar cycle, the Sun's magnetism is perturbed as it stretches past the Earth, blocking some of the cosmic rays that stream in from deep space.Conversely, times of solar quiet allow more cosmic rays to come through.This rhythm is unambiguously reflected in the production of radioactive atoms high in Earth's atmosphere.For instance, times of low solar winds and high cosmic rays coincide with an increase in the amount of carbon-14 that rains down and is eventually incorporated by trees.The analysis of carbon-14 in tree rings gives a detailed history of solar magnetism.Experts suspect that this same mechanism affects the production of clouds and rain, which are major factors in climate change. 
<<Dr. Tinsley of the University of Texas at Dallas, and his colleague Dr. Kenneth V. Beard of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign>>
  have found evidence that  
//a  high flux of cosmic rays produces high electrical conductivity in the atmosphere and high electrical charges on tiny droplets of water at the tops of clouds,  rain.//
 
<<Dr. Tinsley>>
  found  
//clear  links between this mechanism and the paths and intensity of severe winter storms during the  cycle.//
His work was intriguing enough to prompt a study of the electrical effect in June 1996 at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, where 14 papers were presented at a special workshop.Skeptics say the solar ebb and flow is interesting but insufficient to explain satisfactorily the drama of climate change, which they insist is mainly driven by the rise in carbon dioxide. 
<<Dr. James E. Hansen>>
  of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York, a top proponent of the view that humans cause global warming, said in an interview that  
//the  effect of solar brightening on climate might be significant ''but smaller than other mechanisms we already  about.//
''Sunresearchers, on the other hand, say the solar mechanisms are just starting to be understood so much work is needed to understand  how they interact and perhaps amplify one another.They say the knowledge of the Sun's role is destined to grow in the years ahead with the rise of new analyses and evidence, especially as a new solar maximum is reached around 2000. 
<<Dr. Baliunas>>
  said that  
//''our  goal is to make the best model possible'' so scientists can better understand the true role of human pollution in  change.//

PRESIDENT CLINTON has long been seen as an instinctive politician, one with a talent for sensing a public yearning and turning it to political advantage.So why, when Americans are blithely pumping record amounts of gasoline into their Blazers, Jeeps, and not-so-mini-vans, is he preparing to campaign to cut the nation's use of fuel?
Article no :27
 
<<Mr. Clinton>>
  says his goal is  
//to  reduce the threat in  decades//
  
//of  droughts, coastal floods, and famine from  warming//
 --  
//a  warming of the atmosphere caused by rising concentrations of gases, especially carbon dioxide, released when fuels and forests  burned.//
He plans to play host at a climate conference at Georgetown University next week to publicize the issue, and he invited dozens of television weather forecasters to meet with him and Vice President Al Gore at the White House Wednesday, also to discuss global warming.Around Washington, where hot, sticky summers are commonplace, those seeking a political explanation for everything say that global warming simply is a safe haven for a second-term President who is eager to divert attention from more uncomfortable subjects, like campaign financing or his personal life.But scientists and officials involved in the intensifying international debate on how to deal with global warming say it has taken the United States far too long to put the issue front and center, particularly because this country is the biggest source of heat-trapping gases, and because the spread of American-style consumerism to developing nations is likely to create the biggest source of the gases in the next century.A strong consensus has built among scientists that global warming, although not a certainty, is a sufficiently serious threat to justify taking some action.Without concrete action by the United States, climate policy experts say, the rest of the world -- which is eager to replicate America's high-revving, energy-hungry economy -- will be unlikely to conserve coal or oil for the sake of the shared atmosphere.President Clinton's decision to tackle the issue now, some of these experts say, was largely prompted by the need to build public support before he fulfills a pledge to commit the United States to firm limits on future greenhouse emissions.Specifics are expected to be announced by the White House next month and made final at an international climate meeting in Kyoto, Japan, in December.That pledge came after Mr. Clinton became the focus of increasingly harsh criticism from countries like  
<<Britain and Germany,>>
  which have  
//pushed  ahead with environmental programs to cut their output of  dioxide.//
But finding ways to convince the American public of the seriousness of the climate threat will be no mean feat.This is particularly true with the nation feeling flush, with gasoline and oil relatively cheap, and with most of the more obvious environmental problems either solved or being attacked. 
<<Mr. Clinton>>
  had a much easier sell in his last big environmental policy move --  
//toughening  standards for two familiar pollutants, soot  smog.//
Soot and smog are a visible blight that kills old people and asthmatic children.Bubbles in BeerBut carbon dioxide is far harder to paint as a villain.It is, after all, the same invisible stuff that makes the bubbles in beer.And, unlike smog or water pollution -- where solid evidence has been plain for all to see -- global warming is a looming, complicated problem that never quite seems to arrive.In other words, a nightmare for a politician. 
//There  will never be a day when newspaper headlines proclaim ''Earth Warms -- Floods  Erupt,''//
  
<<climate experts>>
 Even the particularly nasty storms, floods, and droughts of recent years, although consistent with the theory, can never be directly ascribed to human meddling with the atmosphere.Indeed, some recent work suggests that variations in the sun's brightness could account for some warming.Mr. Clinton will have to overcome inertia that is being fed by industry.Despite a few recent converts, like British Petroleum, most industries that either produce fossil fuels or rely on them still contend that the science is uncertain and are lobbying for more research before action is taken to cut greenhouse pollution. 
<<Seth Dunn>>
  a climate and energy analyst at the Worldwatch Institute, a private environmental group, said that  
//a  key to any initiative this fall will be to show the economic sense of using fuels sparingly and developing new sources of energy that do not add to the atmosphere's  burden.//
An enormous market for such technologies is already building overseas, and could easily spread here as well, he said.One of Mr. Clinton's soldiers in his environmental campaign is Mr. Gore; the prospect of a hothouse planet was a central theme of his best-selling book, ''Earth in the Balance''(Houghton Mifflin, 1992).Another is Timothy E. Wirth, Undersecretary of State for Global Affairs.Mr. Wirth is a veteran of the communications wars over global warming.As a Senator, he staged one of the first Congressional hearings on the subject during the scorching summer of 1988.To get the point across at the time, staffers called the National Weather Service to be sure the hearing date would be a hot one. ''We had it on that day, and opened all the windows,'' Mr. Wirth recalled.The greenhouse effect became big news.This time, he said, sweaty hearings won't be enough.He said the Clinton Administration is planning to invoke the fate of future generations, just as he did to spur proposed solutions to the budget deficit.To prepare for his improbable climate campaign, Mr. Clinton has been boning up both on the science, and on ways to explain it.Quivering CanariesWhensome of the country's leading climate specialists gathered at the White House in July for a meeting with Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore, they provided a host of simple ways to illustrate the problem.Dr. Stephen H. Schneider, a Stanford University biology professor, invoked the image of canaries carried into coal mines to warn of  noxious gas. ''The canary in the cage is starting to quiver,'' Dr. Schneider said.Mr. Clinton slowly repeated the phrase, as if testing it for future use.
Article no :28
IT'S crunch time at the White House on climate change policy.With the meeting on global warming set for Kyoto, Japan, in December, the Clinton Administration has less than three weeks to come up with its own proposal before the agenda is locked in place by meeting planners and America is reduced to the role of commentator.Cynics have assumed that President Clinton would stake out the easy high ground, demanding more from developing countries (or the United States Congress) than they are prepared to give, thereby obviating the need for action.But the Administration is reportedly trying to piece together a plan that rapidly growing economies like China could live with, yet still buy some insurance against climate change.That is why  
<<White House policy>>
  wonks are now focusing  
//on  hybrid plans that limit greenhouse gas emissions, yet provide an  hatch.//
 
//''The  idea is to get started, but without fear of  surprises,''//
 said  
<<Richard Morgenstern>>
 The European Community is officially gung-ho to set ambitious emissions goals for the developed world and to meet them with the help of carbon emission taxes.The Clinton Administration, by contrast, is reluctant to agree to any policy with teeth unless developing countries -- notably China, India and Russia -- join in.Administration economists are especially taken with emissions trading plans that would allow private businesses in developed countries to pay their counterparts in developing economies to do the heavy lifting.This opens two avenues for rationalizing doing nothing at all.The Administration could earn brownie points with hard-line environmentalists by going along with the Europeans, effectively inviting the Republican Congressional majority to shoot down any agreement. 
<<House Speaker Newt Gingrich>>
  has already warned against  
//an  accord in which ''the U.S. would likely bear too  burden.''//
And Republicans would no doubt go to the barricades before approving a new tax on carbon emissions.Or President Clinton could insist that developing countries fully commit to both targets and means for limiting emissions before he presents the deal to Congress.This would seem statesmanlike while indefinitely delaying the need to ask sacrifice from Americans.The ease of procrastination explains the new interest in hybrid proposals from serious policy types in the Administration who want the President to take the lead in Kyoto.The idea is simple, says Mr. Morgenstern, who, in collaboration with Raymond Kopp and William Pizer at Resources for the Future, has outlined its virtues on the group's Web site (www. rff.org).The researchers would set limits on total carbon emissions and parcel out rights to emit that can be traded between businesses and perhaps countries.But they would also guarantee that no one would ever have to pay more than a ceiling price for permits in the private market -- say $10 a ton -- by having governments sell any number of additional permits at the ceiling.If the ceiling price were low enough, business might be willing to go along.Indeed, a few companies -- most notably  
<<British Petroleum>>
  which announced  
//a  voluntary emissions monitoring program earlier this week in conjunction with the Environmental Defense Fund -- seem eager for modest actions that reduce  uncertainty.//
And since proposed charges for added permits aren't necessarily ''taxes'' in the Republican lexicon, they, too, might go with the flow.The concept is unappealing to environmental lobbies that want strict targets and timetables.But  
<<Mr. Morgenstern>>
  suggests that  
//the  hybrid approach would call the bluff of perennially optimistic enviros, who argue that there is a cheap fix for  problem.//
And it would please many economists, who want to set up a framework for efficient containment of greenhouse gases before the risks of climate change are fully understood. '' 
//This  would be a way to initiate a broad but  commitment,''//
 argued  
<<Robert Stavins>>
 Warwick J. McKibbin and Peter J. Wilcoxen, authors of a climate change ''policy brief'' at the Brookings Institution (www. brook.edu), see other benefits.The price ceiling on permits could be set low enough, they suggest, to make it palatable for rich countries to begin containment without the cooperation of developing countries.Moreover, the chance to collect a fee on excess emissions would give revenue-hungry governments an incentive to enforce the standards.The hybrid approach is too new to allow for a realistic assessment of its chances at Kyoto.But it is appealing on its face.More important, its prominence in current Administration thinking suggests that the White House is treating sacrifices in containing climate change as a problem in political coalition-building rather than a potential obstacle to Al Gore's election in 2000. '' 
//The  real choice is not between a sharp reduction in emissions and a more  policy,''//
  
<<Mr. Wilcoxen>>
  said,  
//''but  between a modest policy and no policy  all.''//

It was cloudy and cool outside the north portico of the White House this morning as Steve Doocy, the jovial Fox News Channel weatherman, asked Al Roker, the ebullient NBC weatherman, just why it was that the President of the United States had invited them over.''Because we promised to bring Krispy Kremes!''Mr. Roker chortled.Then he sobered up and told the Fox viewers watching the live broadcast that Mr. Clinton wanted to talk about changes in the global climate.''Al, let me ask you this,'' Mr. Doocy said.

But he added that, looking at the bright side, he owned some land in Pennsylvania, ''and within a few years, I may have beachfront property!''Onthe theory that you do, in fact, need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows, Mr. Clinton invited more than 100 national and local television forecasters to the White House today for a chat with him and Vice President Al Gore and for briefings on climate change from Government experts. 
<<The Administration>>
  hopes that  
//the  forecasters will influence public opinion on climate change more than the journalists on the  news;//
''You, just in the way you comment on the events that you cover, may have a real effect on the American people,'' Mr. Clinton said this afternoon to the assembled broadcasters, who were overwhelmingly white, male and shorter than they appear on television.Playing host to the nation's television weather forecasters was the most innovative step in a White House campaign to rally public support for new binding global targets for restricting greenhouse gases.A broad coalition of industry and labor groups is spending some $13 million on advertising opposing such targets, which may be adopted at an international conference in December in Kyoto, Japan.''I don't ask for you to advocate or do anything outside of whatever your own convictions are,'' Mr. Clinton said this afternoon, as the skies cleared and the East Room brightened. ''But I do think it's very important, since you have more influence than anybody does on how the American people think about this, that at least you know what you believe and how you think we should proceed.''As the 5 o'clock broadcasts rolled around, dozens of weathermen milled about in the mellowing sunlight on the north lawn of the White House, straightening their hair, consulting notes, muttering lines.While others waited their turns, about six stood bathed in white lights before cameras, speaking to the folks back home or standing, faces blank and microphones at the ready, as they listened for their cues in the distant chatter among the anchors.As they talked about the chill in Buffalo or the pleasant weather here, the forecasters also described the concerns of the President. '' 
//He  wants all of us to think about what is happening to  climate,''//
 said  
<<Chuck Gaidica Jr.>>
 Some were careful to distance themselves from the White House's arguments.

 Judging by the P.R. event that was orchestrated here, it's certainly become a very hot topic in the Clinton Administration.''But other forecasters confessed to their viewers that they were thrilled to be there. ''To be honest with you, I'm just like a little kid,'' said Bob Kovachick of WNYT in Albany.After the camera stopped rolling,  
<<Mr. Kovachick>>
  like many of the other meteorologists, said that he  
//intended  to return to the subject of global warming in broadcasts later tonight and  Thursday.//
Bryan Norcross, of WBRY in Miami, told his viewers about the detailed presentations from Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore. ''Everyone in the room came away impressed that they know what they're talking about, that this isn't just a political event, even though the Vice President is going to run for President,'' he said.Several weathermen said in interviews that they had already been sold on the dangers of climate change before their visit to the White House.Craig Allen, the CBS morning weatherman, said he felt ''absolutely honored'' to be invited to the day's session. ''He feels very strongly about it,'' he said of the President, ''and he just wants us to get the message out.And I'm happy to do it because I lean in that direction.''Calling the day a success, Michael D. McCurry, the White House press secretary, said that the weathermen ''appreciated being treated as something other than airheads.'  
<<Gail MacDonald>>
  president of the Global Climate Coalition, which is made up of  
//business  and trade groups opposed to binding targets for  emissions,//
 said she

We think that any kind of any increased public discourse is good,'' she said. ''We think the journalists involved will look critically at the data and be professional.''Indeed, some forecasters said they were frustrated that Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore had not spelled out any remedies.Mr. Clinton, who is planning to hold a conference on climate change at Georgetown University on Monday, is not expected to reveal his proposed emissions targets for another two or three weeks.''We really haven't heard what it is they expect us to give up or change in our habits,'' Mr. Gaidica said. ''I mean questions as simple as can we use the barbecue today or can we use the Waverunner anymore.''Beyond such skepticism, some weathermen took advantage of their appearance at the White House to attach a few barbs to their famously chipper chatter.

As it seeks a new treaty to fight the threat of global warming, the Clinton Administration has turned marketing on its head: first comes the sales pitch, and later the product will be unveiled.Call it publicity or call it education, the results of the campaign that is now reaching full boil could profoundly affect the proposal for controlling climate change that the Administration takes to Kyoto, Japan, in December.There, the nations will try to agree on a binding treaty to limit emissions of heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide, which comes mostly from burning fossil fuels.The Administration wants to broaden its public support before its negotiators present specific targets and timetables for greenhouse gas emissions.The proposals will probably not be the steep and urgent cuts supported by American environmentalists and some foreign nations, but at least a meaningful first step toward someday stabilizing the levels of greenhouse gases that have been relentlessly building up in the atmosphere.It's a tough sell. 
//''If  anybody tells you this is not a tough issue, they  lying,''//

 said

 Ms. McGinty said the Administration hoped to present details of the United States proposal when international negotiators next met in Bonn later this month.But even before those details are known, the campaign to build support for it comes to a climax of sorts on Monday when carefully selected greenhouse experts assemble at Georgetown University for a daylong conference.The meeting is half a conventional policy seminar where ecologists, economists and lobbyists can have their say.But it also resembles a political convention, a chance to put Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore in the best possible light as they take on a knotty political problem.''What I want to do is to deal with the central political problem here,'' Mr. Clinton told a group of television weather forecasters on Wednesday. ''I don't mean political in terms of party politics, I mean political in how the body politic, how our society responds to this.''He also said: ''Right now, while the scientists see the train coming through the tunnel, most Americans haven't heard the whistle blowing.They don't sense that it's out there as a big issue.And I really believe as President, you know, one of my most important jobs is to tell the American people what the big issues are that we have to deal with.''To counter the Administration, its critics have mounted a $13 million advertising campaign contending that a treaty binding industrial nations to deep cuts in energy use would be unfair because it would not make the same demands on developing countries.And, they argue, such a treaty would damage the United States economy by imposing energy taxes or other punitive costs on companies that burn fossil fuels.For its own sales pitch, the White House is deploying many tools of a classic political campaign: stump speeches and photo opportunities,  the carefully staged meetings, alliances with advocacy groups, and the nearly daily events, like the meeting with the meteorologists, aimed at reaping free media coverage.The campaign began shortly after President Clinton, under pressure from environmentalists and European nations to act more aggressively, told the United Nations in June that he would marshal American public support for a treaty.He assigned Mr. Stern, an experienced White House aide, as a temporary climate ''czar'' to coordinate the Administration's efforts.Mr. Stern brought additional staff from other agencies to help out, and began laying the groundwork for Monday's high-profile public meeting.President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore also met with small groups of sympathetic business leaders, scientists and environmental advocates.Cabinet members hit the hustings, giving dozens of speeches to push the Administration's cause.On Tuesday, for example,  
<<Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt>>
  told the Union of Concerned Scientists, which  
//supports  controls on greenhouse  emissions,//
 that  
//success  in the cause ''depends on all of us, together, taking up the burden  advocacy.//
''Indeed, environmental advocacy groups have been working strenuously to influence the press and the public, to mobilize their millions of members, and to persuade the Clinton Administration to call for deeper, faster cuts in greenhouse gas emissions.The scientists' group issued a call by about 1,500 scientists, including 102 Nobel laureates, more than half of all the living laureates in the sciences, urging significant cuts by industrial nations in the next few years, followed eventually by limits on the developing world.The statement called global warming ''one of the most serious threats to the planet and to future generations.''In a poll conducted in August, before the industry's ad campaign began to air, about three-quarters of registered voters surveyed said they believe that global warming is a serious problem and that a treaty with deep cuts in emissions is needed.The Mellman Group Inc. conducted the poll for the World Wildlife Fund.

When Japan was chosen as the site of this year's conference on climate change, it relished the chance to play host to a landmark meeting to help save the planet from global warming.The meeting, to be held in the ancient capital of Kyoto Dec. 1 to 10, was supposed to demonstrate Japanese leadership and to show that Japan is ready to achieve its dream of a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council.But these days, some officials worry that the meeting will turn out to be not a triumph but a fiasco.''I'm very worried about it,'' said Kazuo Aichi, a former Cabinet minister who is now a pro-environment member of Parliament. ''This will be a test not only of the environment but also of Japanese diplomacy.''The problem is that the Kyoto conference was intended to be a historic convention that would commit countries to cuts in emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, which mainstream scientists believe are linked to global warming.But now that the time for sacrifice is approaching, some countries are losing their enthusiasm.There is even some possibility that Japan will preside over a conference that simply falls apart.''There is that possibility, but we would like to make utmost efforts to avoid the chance that we have no agreement at all,'' said a senior Japanese Government official involved in preparations for the meeting.Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto is caught in a double crossfire on this issue.One is the international battle over whether to require sharp cuts in emissions and if so, to whom to apply them.Any agreement that mandates sharp restrictions or places them only on industrialized countries may be torpedoed by Washington, while one that places a significant burden on poor countries may not get their backing.The other crossfire is taking place among Japanese bureaucrats, who, as usual, are telling the country's leaders what positions to adopt. 
//The  environmental agency is insisting on steep cuts  emissions,//
 while  
<<the Ministry of International Trade and Industry>>
  says that  
//is   preposterous.//
 
<<Mr. Hashimoto>>
  seems to be leaning  
//toward  a compromise that would require industrialized countries to cut their carbon dioxide emissions by the year 2010 to 5 percent below their  level.//
That is much weaker than the European proposal -- for a 15 percent cut below the 1990 level -- but it may still be tougher than the United States is willing to accept.President Clinton is convening a major conference on the issue Monday and is expected to decide on the American position later this month.Some Japanese are demanding that their Government do more to influence the United States now. 
//''The  Kyoto conference will not succeed if Japan simply watches America's reaction and  it,''//
  
<<the Asahi Shimbun>>
 The Government should change its thinking so that it can set a higher target and lead America.''Still, Mr. Hashimoto knows that the final treaty needs America's backing to be effective.The United States produces 22 percent of the world's carbon dioxide emissions, far more than any other country.''Without the United States, we cannot make it,'' the senior official warned. ''The U.S. is vital to this negotiation, and we have to find a solution that is acceptable to it as well.''The Japanese plan that is emerging would adhere to some American suggestions that would effectively ease the burden of the cuts.For example, the treaty would allow trade in emission rights and permit developed countries to get credit for reductions that they help bring about in developing nations.The Prime Minister has yet to decide who will be the chairman of the conference, largely because of skirmishing within the bureaucracy.In the meantime, the dispute has left a vacuum in Japanese preparations.Japan saw this forum as ideal for displaying its leadership.Japan's  ''peace constitution'' rules out military leadership but Tokyo has had a long-time interest in the environment.Now, though, as the Kyoto meeting looms as a far greater challenge than was expected, it raises the risk that it will harm Japan's chance to win a seat on the Security Council.The Asahi Shimbun quoted an unnamed Cabinet minister as reflecting, ''It was from the beginning a mistake for us to take on the host nation's role.''
Article no :32
The debate over global warming has taken on all the characteristics of a political brawl, complete with spin doctors and aggressive advertising.A badly confused public is told one day that only a quick and dramatic reduction in energy use can avert meteorological disaster, then warned the next that any such prescription would send energy prices through the roof and the economy through the floor.If he is smart about it, President Clinton can turn this increasingly polarized argument to his advantage.Most Americans are at least vaguely aware that rising atmospheric temperatures pose real if remote threats.They are also eager to know whether there are ways to address that threat that are both effective and affordable.It is here that Mr. Clinton can make a difference, positioning himself as a moderate in a debate that has so far shed more heat than light.Between now and December, when the industrialized nations will meet in Kyoto, Japan, to negotiate  a treaty controlling emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, Mr. Clinton must devise a specific American proposal.He has already committed himself to ''realistic and binding'' limits on carbon emissions, but has not said what these targets should be and how to reach them.He is unlikely to be any more specific today in his remarks to a White House conference on global warming, a gathering aimed mainly at sharpening public awareness of the issue.But he has already sketched out four principles that will guide his Kyoto proposals.First, he believes, along with most mainstream scientists, that man-made gases produced by the burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil are contributing  to warming and that unless these gases are reduced,  bad things -- coastal flooding and widespread droughts -- are likely to occur late in the 21st century.Second,  he believes that no global emissions-control system  can succeed without the leadership of the United States, which produces one-fifth of the world's greenhouse  gases with only 5 percent of the world's population.Third, he is convinced that developing countries like India and China, which are projected to throw off huge greenhouse emissions, must be part of any global warming agreement -- if not right away, then soon.This is a contentious subject.The Europeans argue that these countries need more time to grow and cannot now be forced into an international regime.
Article no :32
 
<<The Senate>>
  however, has said that it will not  
//ratify  a treaty that does not bind developing countries to  targets.//
Fourth,  
<<Mr. Clinton>>
  wants  
//a  system that will not impose intolerable strain on the  economy.//
He has already rejected as disingenuous (and much too expensive) a European proposal to reduce emissions 15 percent below 1990 levels by 2010.He clearly prefers a more gradual approach, and seems also to have ruled out new gasoline or carbon taxes (neither of which would fly in Congress anyway) and strong new regulations.His preferred approach is to set firm national limits on emissions and then let individual industries meet those targets using the cheapest means possible, either by switching to cleaner fuels or by making far more efficient use of energy.There is one other element to Mr. Clinton's strategy that he has not talked about, but which may well be his ace in the hole in Kyoto as he tries to draw developing countries into the mix while providing flexibility for American industries.Devised by  
<<the Environmental Defense Fund>>
  this is an emissions-trading scheme in which  
//rich  nations that cannot meet their assigned targets without  taxes//
 or  
//investments  would be able to ''buy'' pollution permits from poorer countries whose economies are so inefficient that even the tiniest adjustments can achieve big reductions in  emissions.//
That money, in turn, would help developing countries invest in cleaner technologies.This may not satisfy the Europeans, who find  Mr. Clinton's faith in technology and efficiency touching but unrealistic, or those economists who believe that anything short of a stiff tax on carbon-based fuels will not get the job done.But Mr. Clinton has two constituencies, one in Kyoto and the other in the Senate.If he means to win over both, a modest course may be his only course.ROBERT B. SEMPLE JR.

With  
<<President Clinton>>
  having accepted  
//the  dominant view among scientists that global warming is a  matter,//
 the increasingly urgent debate over what to do about it has largely shifted to the question of  
//how  restricting emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide may affect the  economy.//
And there, perplexity reigns.The future severity of climate change is uncertain enough, and its future physical impact on particular countries and regions is more so.The uncertainty multiplies yet again when people try to calculate the costs and benefits of taking action to reduce greenhouse emissions. 
//''There's  a lot more uncertainty about the economics than about  climate,''//
 said  
<<Dale W. Jorgenson>>
 Carbon dioxide is produced by the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas, which are the energy foundation of the modern economy.Some players in the debate, notably industries that produce fossil fuels or use lots of them, argue that serious economic damage would result if use of the fuels were significantly cut.Others, like environmentalists and advocates of alternatives to fossil-fuel energy, say the economy as a whole would gain because it would use energy more efficiently.In between is a range of estimates, typically based on uncertain assumptions about how various aspects of the economy would respond to cuts in the use of fossil fuel and how strategies for cutting emissions would actually work.All of this will be under the spotlight in Washington today at a daylong conference on climate change sponsored by the White House. 
<<Mr. Clinton>>
  who plans to take part in the meeting,  
//supports  legally binding international action to cut emissions, but not at the price of harming the United  economy.//
He is under intensifying pressure to come up with a specific proposal for reducing emissions.The United States proposal is generally seen as critical to efforts by the nations of the world to negotiate cuts at a meeting in Kyoto, Japan, in December.It is widely expected that Mr. Clinton's proposal will be announced later this month, either just before or at a pre-Kyoto negotiating session that begins on Oct. 20 in Bonn.But as the moment of truth approaches, even some leading members of the Clinton Administration have all but thrown up their hands over the difficulty of obtaining clear answers to some crucial economic questions. 
<<Janet L. Yellen>>
  the chairwoman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, told Congress in July that  
//it  was futile to try to develop a set of economic models that can ''give us a definitive answer as to the economic impacts of a given climate  policy.''//
Computerized models are the main analytical tool  economists use.

//''If  anybody tells you that he or she has the definitive answer as to the costs and benefits of particular climate  policies,''//
  
<<Dr. Yellen>>

//''I  would suggest that you raise your  eyebrows.//
''Cananything useful be said that might aid the search for a solution creating the least economic strain?There is general agreement that reductions of emissions would come at some cost to the economy and that the size of the cost depends largely on the size of the cuts and how rapidly they are carried out.Energy costs would very likely rise, at least for a time, and some industry sectors, it is generally agreed, could be hit hard if they were not able to adapt quickly enough.Chief among these is perhaps the coal industry; coal burning emits the most carbon dioxide per unit of energy, and the nation's utilities depend heavily on it.But many economists also say there are a number of ways to cut the costs substantially, through policy measures.One is by imposing a tax on fuels in proportion to their carbon content.The revenues from the tax would be used to reduce other Federal taxes, thus pumping money back into the economy.Many economists see a carbon tax as the most economically efficient way to reduce emissions.But any sort of energy tax is likely to face deadly opposition in the Republican Congress.So attention is focusing on another possible cost-reducing mechanism: emissions trading.In this arrangement, the Government sets an overall cap on emissions and issues permits to companies to emit carbon dioxide within that limit.Companies that find it more difficult and expensive to limit emissions could buy permits from those that find it easier and cheaper.The price of the permits is set in an open market.Proponents of this plan, now in use for industrial sulfur dioxide emissions, say it cuts overall costs significantly.But many economists argue that unless the permits are initially auctioned by the Government and the proceeds used to reduce other taxes, much of the cost-cutting benefit to the economy would be lost.The United States also favors extending the cap-and-permit idea to the international arena.Richer countries, which emit lots of carbon and would find cuts relatively expensive, could pay poorer ones, partly in technological assistance, to reduce some of theirs.Proponents of this idea say that since it would be cheaper to make cuts in developing countries, the cost both to the United States and the global economy would be lower.A third way to reduce costs, some economists say, is to allow some flexibility in the timing of reductions.They argue, for instance, that forcing industries to replace their physical plants with more energy-efficient ones before their natural economic life is over would be very expensive.A fourth cost-cutting idea, cited by environmentalists and advocates of alternative energy sources like solar and wind energy, is for government to aggressively promote the adoption of more fuel-efficient technologies.These are myriad, and range from small things like devices making it unnecessary for television sets to use power when they are off, to large things like automobiles that deliver 60 or 70 miles a gallon to ways of burning coal more efficiently.A recent study by  
<<five of the Government s national laboratories>>
  concluded that  
//vigorous  promotion of such technologies could reduce carbon emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2010 while saving enough energy to at least offset the cost of putting the technologies  place.//
It was the latest in a long line of studies that have come to similar conclusions; some have found, in fact, that the energy savings from new technologies would increase gross domestic product, which is the total of all goods and services produced, by 1 or 2 percent a year over the long run.Other economists, principally those who model the economy's overall operations, dispute this optimistic assessment, while acknowledging that some gains are possible through new technology. 
//''Virtually  all analysts believe that there's some low-hanging fruit  there,''//
 said  
<<Richard Richels>>
  an economist at the Electric Power Research Institute, a research organization in Palo Alto, Calif.,  
//that  is supported by the  industry.//
The disagreement, Mr. Richels said, is over how much technological fruit can be easily picked.A recent study by  
<<Robert Repetto and Duncan Austin>>
  of the World Resources Institute, an independent research group in Washington, found that  
//such  ''bottom up'' assessments as the five-laboratory study, which try to add up the expected impact on the economy from a wealth of new technologies, probably overstate the potential  savings.//
But  
<<the World Resources Institute>>
  also found that  
//some  conventional ''top down'' models, which analyze the economy's overall performance, tend to overstate  costs.//
Typically, the top-down models say reducing emissions to 1990 levels by 2010 would trim gross domestic product by 1 or 2 percent, with some predicting much greater losses.Mr. Repetto and Mr. Austin examined 162 estimates from 16 models and found that 80 percent of their differences could be explained by what they assumed about economic uncertainties.For example, the prediction turns out more optimistically if one assumes that the economy responds relatively easily to changes in policy, that noncarbon fuels are readily available and easily adopted and that damages from air pollution and climate change are averted as a result.Opposite assumptions produce more pessimism.Predictions that a carbon tax or a cap-and-trade policy would seriously harm the economy are unrealistic, the two researchers wrote, because ''they stem from worst-case modeling assumptions.''Assessing the damages of climate change, and therefore the benefits of averting it, is perhaps the chanciest task of all, and relatively few economists have tried it.One who has,  
<<William D. Nordhaus>>
  of Yale University, says his best guess is that  
//benefits  to the overall market economy of the United States may just about balance costs over the  century.//
But that guess, Mr. Nordhaus said, comes ''with big uncertainties. 
//''The  most  uncertainties,//
 said  
<<Mr. Jorgenson>>
  of Harvard,  
//have  to do with how much economic growth will take place in future decades even in the absence of any  problem.//
 
//Unlike  some industry leaders, who argue that the uncertainties warrant doing nothing  emissions,//
  
<<Mr. Jorgenson>>
  says  
//they  are an argument for taking preventive action in the interest of  generations.//
But he also says he believes that the cost of reducing emissions to 1990 levels by 2010 would be too high and advocates a more modest policy.But if the policy is too modest, say many involved in the pre-Kyoto international talks, it risks losing credibility with developing countries, which have refused to undertake binding reductions until the richer nations show that they are serious.What's more,  
<<the Administration and the Senate,>>
  whose ratification would be required on any Kyoto agreement, have refused  
//any  deal that does not in some way include the  countries.//
Then there are the Europeans, who have proposed cutting emissions 15 percent below 1990 levels and are increasingly at odds with the United States over the issue.However things turn out, flesh-and-blood political realities are likely to overshadow uncertain science and economics in the diplomatic endgame at Kyoto.Warming WorldThis article is one of a series that have appeared since Aug. 12 on the science, politics and economics of climate change with the approach of an international meeting in Kyoto, Japan, in December to discuss limits on greenhouse gases.
Article no :34
History can be made in subtle ways, almost without anyone noticing.This happened on Monday at President Clinton's conference on global warming.The meeting was intended to build national support for some effort to reduce carbon dioxide output in the United States, a pep rally before our team heads off in December to Kyoto, Japan, for the negotiations on a treaty regulating global emissions of greenhouse gases.But behind that cheerleading, Mr. Clinton seemed to move the goalposts of the climate game in dangerous ways.Here's how the scoreboard changed: Before the Industrial Revolution, the world's air contained about 275 parts per million of carbon dioxide, the main heat-trapping gas.By now we've burned enough fossil fuel to reach 365 parts per million.We can already see the effects: higher temperatures, increased rainfall and glacial melting.But when scientists warned about the really scary probabilities -- coastal flooding, widespread drought and so on -- they always said these would happen if we didn't keep carbon dioxide from doubling, to 550 parts per million.That level was what all the greenhouse fuss was about.By Monday's gathering, however, holding carbon dioxide to a ''mere'' doubling seemed to have become our unofficial national goal.On one chart that the President's advisers kept returning to, the path of doubled carbon dioxide showed up as ''the green line'' in the graph's center -- implying that holding emissions to this level had become the new target.The line of greatest danger had shifted to 700 parts per million.In other words, the President seems to be resigned to the fate scientists once feared.It's not that the scientists have decided that a world with doubled carbon dioxide will be more benign than they thought.In fact, their predictions have grown more frightening.But holding atmospheric concentrations below a doubling would require swifter action than the President seems to back.It could still be done.Computer models show that strong global action by 2005 could stabilize the carbon dioxide level below 450 parts per million, which is still quite high but not as dangerous.But Administration economists predict such action might harm the economy as much as the oil shocks of the 1970's.Forced to choose between the chance of a recession in the next few years and the near certainty of drastic environmental change 50 years away, Mr. Clinton seems ready to side with the economists.Politics may leave him no choice.But it's a tragic change.He will no doubt claim to be choosing the middle path, but until the last few weeks that was the very route we were pledged to avoid.Bill McKibben is the author of the forthcoming ''Maybe One: A Personal and Environmental Argument for Single-Child Families.''

Article no :35
To the dismay of environmentalists seeking swift action to toughen the international treaty on climate change, President Clinton's senior economic and environmental advisers are urging him to delay until the year 2010 and beyond the time when the United States and other industrial nations must achieve deep new reductions in the pollution that may cause global warming.Assuming  
//that  international negotiations produce such a treaty this year to help control  change,//
  
<<Mr. Clinton s advisers>>
  are warning him not to present it for the Senate's approval  
//unless  developing countries  agree,//
 in a separate pact negotiated within the next few years,  
//to  control their own emission of  gases.//
The advisers' recommendations were described by leaders of several environmental organizations who said they had been briefed on the proposals.White House officials involved in the discussions today refused to discuss their recommendations, which are in an options paper that they expect to give the President as early as Friday.The options were pieced together after strenuous debate between environmental advisers and economic advisers, who expressed reservations about the potential cost of controlling emissions too quickly.Among the staff who put together the policy options are Gene Sperling, the President's economic policy assistant; Kathleen McGinty, the head of the Council on Environmental Quality; Todd Stern, a senior aide who is coordinating the policy discussions; and Lawrence Summers, the Deputy Treasury Secretary.Outside environmental advocates, including leaders of the Environmental Defense Fund, the Union of Concerned Scientists, the Sierra Club, and the Environmental Information Center, responded to what they heard by warning the White House that they would actively oppose any agreement along the lines that were being recommended. 
//''It's  clear that the President's men  blinked,''//

 It remains to be seen if the President will blink.'  
<<Phil Clapp>>
  executive director of the Environmental Information Center, said that  
//for  President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore to accept long delays after campaigning against global warming for years would ''create severe credibility problems for them on almost any  issue.//
''On the other hand,  
<<powerful industry groups>>
  have long urged the Clinton Administration to defer action, saying that  
//not  enough is yet known about how the climate might change to justify the potential costs in money and jobs that they contend an all out commitment to reduce emissions  require.//
For their part, the President's advisers say they are determined to offer a plan that is realistic politically and economically, not just attractive on the environmental merits.The most aggressive option before the President would call on industrial nations to reduce emissions of the greenhouse gases by 2010, without requiring further reductions.Other options would take even longer to stabilize emissions.In a treaty signed five years ago in Rio de Janeiro, the United States and other industrial nations said they would try to get emissions reduced, back to the level that existed in 1990, by the year 2000.Most now acknowledge they will not meet that deadline.The United States' emissions are now projected to be 13 percent above 1990 levels by 2000.Recognizing that the Rio goals were not sufficient to end the rapid accumulation of greenhouse gases that many scientists say threatens to significantly change the earth's climate in the coming century, the nations that signed that treaty have been trying for two years to negotiate a tougher pact that would set new, binding targets and timetables.The negotiations resume in Bonn on Oct. 20 and are supposed to be completed in Kyoto, Japan, in December.The recommendations to President Clinton come a few days after Japan proposed a schedule that would cut emissions 5 percent below 1990 levels by 2010.The European nations have called for reductions of 15 percent below 1990 levels by that time, and some nations have sought even deeper emissions. 
<<The White House>>
  has said it wanted to pursue  
//reductions  that would be binding, politically realistic and  achievable.//
But so far it has not spelled out specific goals.

<<One global warming expert>>
  who is close to the Administration said there are three main options on the table: one  
//to  stabilize emissions at 1990 levels by 2010, one to do so by 2015  2020,//
 and one  
//to  gradually reduce the growth rate of emissions and to freeze them  day.//
But the environmental groups said these options do not represent a binding commitment, because they include an escape mechanism that would limit the amount of money American companies would have to spend to meet any emission targets.The Administration favors allowing companies to buy and sell emission permits for carbon dioxide, an approach that advocates say would effectively create a marketplace for pollution control ideas and help keep compliance costs down.Companies that come up with cheap controls could sell their permits for a profit.But  
//out  of fear that emissions controls would be  expensive,//
  
<<the Administration>>
  now  
//is  considering putting a cap on the price of the permits and guaranteeing to sell additional permits at  price.//
 
//''This  would spoil the market mechanism and remove the incentives to  innovations,''//

//''Such  policies would be totally inconsistent with the gravity and urgency of the global  threat,''//
 said  
<<the leaders of 17 environmental organizations>>
 They said they would be ''compelled to oppose'' a policy that ''simply seeks to freeze emissions at 1990 levels by 2010 or later, or that includes a treaty-busting escape clause.''

FOR more than a decade, the auto industry has pretty much got what it wanted in this town.Tighter fuel standards?Forget about it.New safety standards?Small potatoes only, please.But suddenly, Detroit is finding a new reason to worry about Washington: global warming.Industry officials say there is no greater threat to the American auto industry than a concerted worldwide push to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other so-called greenhouse gases, the suspected culprits in long-term global climate change.Asked to rank the industry's major policy and regulatory concerns over the next few years, a senior representative of the Big Three answered, ''Global warming is No.1, and everything else is very far behind.''No, Congress has not slipped out of Republican hands, and the Sierra Club's lobbyists are still outnumbered on K Street.But

It is not surprising then, that when the President met with the chief executives of  
<<General Motors Ford and Chrysler>>
  at the White House earlier this month to discuss trade policies, what he heard instead were  
//complaints  about  control.//
The Kyoto conference will lay the road map for the next five years on how the world begins to cope with carbon emissions and their effect on climate and health.The proposal that frightens auto makers most is one that will impose strict emissions standards on the developed nations but exempt the developing world, where the growth in greenhouse gas emissions is expected to be much more rapid.Carbon dioxide occurs naturally in the atmosphere, but it is also emitted by cars, factories and the burning of carbon-based fuels like oil, coal and wood.Levels of this and other greenhouse gases are rising and thought to be warming the planet by trapping sunlight that otherwise would be reflected back into space.The automobile is a chief source of these gases.To environmental advocates, it is also one of the easiest to control. 
//''The  reason they think it's such a threat is that the biggest single step we can take to prevent it is making our car go farther on a gallon  gas,''//
 said  
<<Dan Becker>>
 So we are advocating higher-mileage cars.''Mr.Becker said a car that gets 27.5 miles a gallon produces 38 tons of carbon dioxide gas over a 10-year lifetime.A 45-mile-per-gallon car emits 23 tons.That is what worries auto makers.One of their least-favorite pieces of legislation over the last 20 years is the law imposing corporate average fuel economy, or CAFE standards, forcing them to sell two or three economy cars for every low-mileage, high-profit car they produce.THERE is no known way to eliminate carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of gasoline. 
<<Mr. Stanton>>
  said  
//there  are only two ways to reduce such emissions: drive less or drive in cars that burn  gas.//
That means either raising gasoline prices, imposing transportation-control measures like car pooling or alternate-day driving, or raising CAFE standards. 
//Each  of these steps would impose huge costs on the industry -- and thus car buyers -- with  benefits,//
  
<<Mr. Stanton>>
 ''The truth of the matter is there are lots of questions on the science of global warming,'' he said. ''We don't think the state of knowledge justifies spending $200 billion to $300 billion a year to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels.''Mr.Becker scoffed. ''The industry has shown an unwillingness to improve economy without CAFE standards,'' he said. ''Our conclusion is that we can't rely on the environmental views of Detroit to improve the global warming pollution picture.'

//barred  the Administration from taking steps to increase fuel  standards.//
While the possibility of new fuel-economy rules is the industry's major concern, there are several other significant issues before Congress and the regulatory agencies.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is about to rule on consumer requests to disable air bags in cars, vans and light trucks.The agency is expected to approve on-off switches for passenger air bags that would address concerns for the safety of children, the elderly and short adults.Views are mixed within the industry, with Ford and General Motors preparing to install on-off switches for customers who ask for them, while Chrysler, Honda and others are reluctant to offer the choice of disengaging the life-saving devices.All auto makers agree that the preferable solution to the few cases of fatal air-bag deployment is not deactivation, but ''smart'' air bags with sensors that can reduce the explosive power of the bag when a seat is occupied by a child or a small adult.But auto makers are uncertain customers would be willing to pay the extra cost, about $250 a vehicle.Another issue is international trade, which is splitting auto makers and their unions, who are shoulder to shoulder against radical steps on global warming.

<<Shirley Zebroski>>
 Our focus remains on getting improved access throughout the world for our products.''TheUnited Automobile Workers and other unions are skeptical about President Clinton's call for ''fast-track'' authority to negotiate trade agreements.They say that such deals encourage American manufacturers to build plants overseas to take advantage of lower wages and looser environmental standards.Also on Congress's auto agenda this fall is renewal of the nation's transportation financing program, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, better known as Istea.Senator John H. Chafee, Republican of Rhode Island, introduced the six-year, $145 billion bill in September, saying it would assure the quality and safety of the nation's roads into the next century.MR. 
<<CHAFEE>>
  said he  
//expected  the auto makers' support in getting the bill through Congress, despite the fact that it contains a number of safety and environmental provisions that will cost the  money.//
''There's plenty in it for the auto companies,'' the Senator said. ''Literally billions of dollars are going to be spent making our roads even better and maintaining them, which is terribly important to them.''In summing up

 For labor and the Democrats, their issue is jobs.Then there are the big regional differences, the Midwest where the plants are and the Northeast, where the pollution is.''Whenyou look at nitty-gritty,'' he said, ''it cuts across both parties pretty evenly.''

//Four   ago,//
  
<<President Clinton>>
  stood in the Rose Garden and  
//declared  that by the end of the decade his Administration would reverse the increase in the nation's emissions of pollutants that threaten to warm the  climate.//
On Oct. 17, 1993, as he issued a 50-point plan, the President said, ''Today, I reaffirm my personal, and announce our nation's, commitment to reducing our emissions of greenhouse gases to their 1990 levels by the year 2000.''To skeptics who called the plan too weak, he promised periodic reviews and modifications to keep the reduction of emissions on track.Mr. Clinton's detailed promise, and how the nation is breaking it, will be at the heart of the Administration's problem this week in Bonn when representatives from around the world once again meet on the climate.They will be negotiating how quickly the industrial nations must rein in the emissions of carbon dioxide and other so-called greenhouse gases that build up in the atmosphere and trap the heat of the sun.The talks are supposed to end in December in Kyoto, Japan, with a new treaty on climate change to strengthen the one most of the world's nation's agreed to in Rio de Janeiro in 1992.And while the United States has called for a binding new treaty, it is also calling for what the White House calls realistic targets and timetables for reducing emissions that cause the greenhouse effect.At the current rate of growth, the  emission of greenhouse gases by the United States will be 13 percent above the level of 1990 by the end of the decade. 
<<The Administration>>
  has indicated that it  
//will  most likely postpone until the year 2010 or beyond the goal Mr. Clinton pledged to meet  2000.//
Instead of accomplishing the goal in the year Mr. Clinton leaves office, the country would have to wait until well after his successor finished a second term.The reason, many critics say, is that  
<<the Administration>>
  refused to impose mandatory measures, like  
//requiring  the fuel efficiency of automobiles to  increased,//
 or  
//raising  energy taxes to force people to  fuel.//
Greenhouse gases come mostly form burning fossil fuels, like coal and oil, and one of the best ways to reduce their emission is to save energy. 
//''The  only thing we know for absolute certain is that voluntary programs  work,''//
 said  
<<Jessica Tuchman Matthews>>
 And that is progress.It was probably a stage that we had to go through.''KathleenMcGinty, the top environmental aide at the White House, cited three main reasons for the failure of the 50-point plan to achieve its goals: Congressional cuts in financing for energy conservation, the unexpectedly high rate of economic growth and fuel prices that were cheaper than anticipated.Other factors, too, helped to undermine the Administration's efforts. 
<<Congress>>
  temporarily blocked the Energy Department from  
//issuing  new energy efficiency standards for  appliances,//
 and the department itself failed to issue  
//new  efficiency standards for electrical distribution transformers on power lines, where about 7 percent of all the nation's power simply  away.//
A proposal to label car tires so that consumers could tell which ones provided the best gasoline mileage went nowhere; the same fate awaited a tax proposal to discourage employers from subsidizing parking spaces for their employees.And forestry agencies missed the goals for planting trees, which absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as they grow.Only 70 percent of the projected reductions in greenhouse gases materialized, and even these reductions were offset when the booming economy brought a growing demand for fossil fuels.When  
<<Mr. Clinton>>
  issued his action plan four years ago, he  
//projected  that it would reduce greenhouse-gas emissions by about 109 million tons a year  2000.//
That would be enough to return emissions to their 1990 level: 1.58 billion tons of carbon, an amount that had grown only slightly to 1.59 billion tons in 1992, the year before the plan was announced.Instead, the emissions in 1995 totaled 1.67 billion tons, and when the annual report for 1996 is issued later this month, it is virtually certain to show further growth.To be sure, the growth would have been even greater without the energy-saving plan. 
<<Michael Oppenheimer>>
  a climate scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund, called  
//the  reductions achieved ''nothing to  at.''''It//
  
//is  a very big achievement, that voluntary programs were able to do  well,''//
The trouble is, the legs were cut out from under the voluntary program.Volunteerism works a lot better when it is matched up with mandatory measures.Jawboning is going to be less effective unless there is a cap on emissions.''A report by  
<<the State Department>>
  in July predicted that  
//if  the present levels of spending on energy conservation programs are continued under the plan, the emission of greenhouse gases would exceed 2 billion tons by the year 2010 and 2.2 billion tons  2020.//
So  
<<the Administration>>
  wants to impose  
//a  new cap on future  gases.//
Under its plan, companies would be given permits to emit greenhouse gases, but at a reduced level.Companies that can inexpensively reduce their emissions below the cap would be allowed to sell their excess permits to companies that have a harder time cutting emissions.This approach, advocates say, would drive down the overall cost of compliance while guaranteeing that the nation's emissions' goals would be met.But the utility industry, which did more than any other sector to slow the growth of emissions under the voluntary plan, opposes stricter measures. 
//''We  just have a  disagreement,''//
 said  
<<Robert A. Beck>>
  vice president  
//for   affairs//
which represents electric companies, ''We believe you have not maximized the voluntary programs yet.''Hundreds of utilities signed up for a voluntary program called  
<<the Climate Challenge>>
  and the  
//steps  they have promised to take are estimated to have cut 45 million tons from emissions of greenhouse gases that otherwise would have occurred  2000.//
But despite those reductions, the total emissions from the utility companies nationwide are going up, not down, and many of the reductions came from actions like switching to natural gas from coal, which might have occurred anyway.Of the reductions utilities say they achieved, 30 percent came from nuclear power plants, which do not emit any polluting gases, notably the opening by a Texas utility of a nuclear power plant that was ordered decades before global warming appeared on the nation's agenda.Only 7 percent of the reduction came from renewable energy projects, for example solar and wind.In the transportation sector, which accounts for about a third of the nation's greenhouse gas emissions, the action plan offered almost no proposals to reduce emissions in the short term, and none were forthcoming.A series of negotiations among industry, environmentalists and Government officials, aimed at achieving 2 percent annual increases in automotive fuel efficiency, broke down in disagreement.

Based on actions in Congress so far, it appears that spending on these areas at the Energy Department next year will grow 10 percent, to about $924 million.

<<The Environmental Protection Agency>>
  for example,  
//sets  rules under the Clean Air Act that require large landfills to capture and burn their emissions of methane, a gas that contributes to the  effect.//
When the agency issued the rules in 1996, it acted more strictly than planned, and the latest estimates are that the emission of greenhouse gases will be reduced by 8 million tons by the year 2000.That is 60 percent more reductions than the original plan predicted.
Article no :39
As negotiations resume in Bonn on a new treaty to save the planet from global warming, the United States said today that its emissions of heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere grew last year at the highest rate since the nation pledged to cut them back. 
//Emissions  of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases grew 3.4 percent in 1996, the latest year for which comprehensive estimates  available,//
  
<<the Energy Department>>
 The department attributed the increase to strong economic growth, unusually severe weather and increased use of coal by electric utilities.Emissions from energy use in residential and commercial buildings grew 6.3 percent and 5.5 percent, respectively, despite programs intended to increase energy efficiency.At the same time, the report said, growing consumption of fuel by less efficient cars and light trucks suggests that motor vehicles may soon overtake industry as the largest source of gases suspected of causing global warming by effectively creating a greenhouse around Earth. 
//''The  economy is booming, energy prices are relatively low, and a lot of people are paying a lot less attention to  efficiency,''//
 said  
<<Steven Nadel>>
  
//''If  you have unfettered energy use and big  growth,''//
  
<<Mr. Nadel>>
  said,  
//''it  is not surprising that carbon emissions are going  increase.//
We need more active and aggressive policies.Laissez-faire does not work.''The report is acutely embarrassing to American negotiators at the climate talks, because the United State, with less than a 20th of the world's population, gives off almost a fourth of the gases that trap heat in the atmosphere, threatening widespread climate change.In a treaty on climate change signed by 160 nations in 1992, the United States and other industrial countries pledged to reduce their emissions of such gases to 1990's level by 2000.But American emissions in 1996 were 7.4 percent above 1990 levels, the report said.For some time  
<<the Clinton Administration>>
  has forecast that  
//by  the end of the decade, emissions of the gases in the United States will be 13 percent higher than  1990.//
With the economy still growing and people driving farther in cars that use more gasoline per mile, the upward trend is widely expected to continue.The parties to the treaty are meeting in Bonn this week to try to negotiate a new, binding agreement that cuts emissions beyond 2000.The talks are supposed to conclude in December in Kyoto, Japan.European nations, saying they are well on their way to achieving the target for 2000, are pressing for deeper cuts in emissions by 2010.Emissions of carbon dioxide, the main heat-trapping gas, increased to record levels in all five sectors that the Government report tracked: residential buildings, commercial buildings, industrial sites, transportation, and electricity generation.
Article no :40
An American team in Bonn is deep in negotiations that, it is hoped, will lead to the signing of an international treaty on global warming in Kyoto, Japan, in December.Such a treaty would define the responsibilities of roughly 170 nations for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. 
<<President Clinton>>
  who is scheduled to outline his policy on global warming today, must walk a fine line,  
//balancing  the concerns of environmentalists who worry about the fate of  earth//
 and  
//those  of business and labor constituencies who worry about the fate of their companies  jobs.//
But on what basis should the President strike that balance?The typical economic approach to such problems is cost-benefit analysis.But there is a big problem with applying that tool here.While we have some ability to quantify the costs of policies intended to retard global warming, we have little basis for estimating the benefits.The scientific consensus takes us only so far.Yes, global warming is for real.Yes, burning fossil fuels seems to be a significant cause.And yes, most potential climatic consequences are worrisome -- and some are truly horrifying.But scientists cannot tell us how the earth's climate will change if nothing is done.So I suggest a different approach: Instead of weighing costs against benefits, it makes more sense to look at action against global warming as taking out an insurance policy.This is what homeowners do, spending hundreds of dollars every year to insure their families against the unknown, though presumably small probability that their house will burn down.Shouldn't the family of man do the same for its home?As we shop for this global insurance policy, we should seek the most economical one.We can drastically reduce its cost by applying four basic economic principles:*Market-based approaches work more efficiently than clumsy command-and-control techniques.The leading candidate in this case seems to be distributing or auctioning permits to emit, say, carbon dioxide, and then allowing free-market trading to establish their price.By now we have enough experience with emissions trading to predict that it will reduce pollution at a fraction of the cost of regulation.The President is expected to emphasize these kinds of incentives to reach his goals.It is time that the rest of the world got on board.* Global problems require global perspectives and responses.It makes sense to reduce carbon emissions where that can be done most cheaply.We should therefore explore innovations like global emissions trading and allowing American companies to ''buy'' emissions reduction in other countries, although both are fraught with practical difficulties.It is important that all countries get involved.We cannot hold developing nations to the same standards as developed ones, but their eventual participation is essential.*Haste makes waste.It's cheaper to engineer new products for energy efficiency than it is to retrofit old ones.That means we can greatly lower the costs of reducing carbon emissions if we allow our existing transportation fleet, factories, home heating systems and especially power-generating plants to wear out rather than scrapping them.We can afford such patience because it is the accumulated concentration of greenhouse gases that affects global temperatures, not the annual output of emissions.For these reasons, the much-debated target of reducing emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000, as enunciated at the 1992 summit meeting in Rio de Janeiro, is too demanding.It would be more prudent to start slowly, then gradually grow more strict.We need to emulate the tortoise, not the hare.* Reducing reliance on fossil fuels is not an anti-growth policy.It is an insurance policy against climatic disruptions that could severely damage the world's economies.We do not want people to turn off the heat and turn in their cars.We do need to make fossil fuels more expensive.But any revenues raised from, say, auctioning emissions permits should be promptly returned to the economy via tax cuts, research and development spending, and compensating victims (for example, coal miners).These four principles do not constitute an instruction manual for American negotiators in Bonn.Nonetheless, accepting them would represent a giant step toward banishing both Chicken Little and Dr. Pangloss from the debate.Then we can get down to issues like how to design and enforce a global emissions trading system in the absence of any meaningful global government, and how to persuade developing nations to participate.No, the sky is not falling; it is just filling up with greenhouse gases a bit too fast for comfort.But blithely assuming that nature and laissez-faire will take care of everything amounts to betting the earth's climate on a roll of the dice.If we lose the bet, our grandchildren will not likely forgive us.Nor should they.Alan S. Blinder, a professor of economics at Princeton, was a vice chairman of the Federal Reserve and a member of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers.
Article no :41
The most important thing to understand about  
<<President Clinton>>
  s speech on global warming yesterday is that he has  
//asked  the United States, a hungry producer and consumer of energy, to  course.//
He has publicly committed the country to a plan to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide, the gas mainly responsible for what could be a calamitous increase in atmospheric temperatures.He has agreed to binding targets and a timetable -- the stabilization of greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012.He has proposed a system for doing so, relying largely on market mechanisms, energy efficiency and technology.His package is less than what many environmentalists had hoped for and not nearly as aggressive as the goals that some foreign countries will put on the table when the industrialized nations convene in Kyoto, Japan, in December to try to negotiate a global climate treaty.The Europeans, for example, are seeking net reductions from 1990 levels by a much earlier date, 2005.But the plan also asks American industry to make greater investments in cleaner fuels and new technologies than they have been asked to make in the past.The threat is clear.If industry does not make these investments, Mr. Clinton's successors may have to resort to far more expensive remedies to achieve the targets he has set.Indeed, there are many who argue that even Mr. Clinton's relatively modest goals cannot be met without carbon taxes that would encourage switches to cleaner fuels, or stiff new gasoline taxes that would encourage energy conservation.Mr. Clinton has rejected that course, in part because he knows it would be difficult to sell to the present Congress and in part because he believes that innovation, incentives and the free market can get the job done without serious economic turmoil.To that end, he proposes to give industries that achieve early reductions in emissions ''credits'' against the day when firm industry-by-industry emissions caps take effect.
Article no :41
By giving extra credit to companies that lower emissions quickly, Mr. Clinton hopes to spur innovation and efficiencies and put the United States on a downward slope as early in the next century as possible.That is exactly the slope the country must be on if it is to scale back its emissions to 1990 levels.Mr. Clinton has also embraced another innovative idea that could help solve one of the most vexing problems facing the negotiators in Kyoto -- how to bring developing countries like China and India into a global system.The developing countries will not be legally bound by whatever plan is hatched in Kyoto. 
<<Mr. Clinton>>
  s idea is to  
//entice  them into the system with an international emissions trading program under which rich nations can win further credits against their targets by helping poorer nations develop advanced, and presumably cleaner, methods of  energy.//
The environmentalists and the Europeans will surely press Mr. Clinton for a more accelerated timetable before his negotiators arrive in Kyoto.But that cannot obscure the fact that for the first time, a President has committed this country to changing the ways it produces and uses energy.
Article no :42
After two years of struggle over what to do about global warming, the Clinton Administration and the developing countries in the global game of greenhouse politics have put their cards on the table, and negotiations have at last begun in earnest.The talks ''have come alight, and not a moment too soon,'' said Michael Zammit Cutajar of Malta, the executive secretary of the United Nations body that administers the 1992 treaty on climate change.Delegates from 150 countries are gathered here to discuss possible revisions to the treaty, in the last of eight negotiating sessions leading up to a final session in Kyoto, Japan, in December.The American plan, announced today by President Clinton in Washington, represents the low-ball bid. 
<<Mr. Clinton>>
  called for  
//stabilizing  industrialized countries' emissions of heat-trapping gases at 1990 levels by  2010,//
 with  
//a  modest reduction below 1990 levels by  2020.//
A sharply contrasting proposal, presented formally today by the developing countries and China, calls for the rich countries to cut their emissions by 7.5 percent below 1990 levels by 2005, 15 percent by 2010 and 35 percent by 2020.An agreement in Kyoto, should one be reached, apparently lies somewhere between the two boundaries set by the United States and the Group of 77 Plus China, as the developing countries call themselves.With today's announcements, the negotiating ''universe'' has been firmly delineated for the first time.Under the 1992 treaty, the developing countries are explicitly exempted from undertaking any specific commitments, and they have steadfastly maintained that they will not agree to do so unless the rich nations demonstrate convincingly that they are serious about taking the lead.The rationale is that since the industrialized countries are the biggest emitters of the gases and got rich by emitting them, they should take the first steps toward reduction.While  
//agreeing  that the developed countries should take  lead,//
  
<<President Clinton>>
  reasserted today the United States position  
//that  the poorer countries must be part of any  solution.//
The poorer countries' emissions are expected to exceed those of the developed world within two or three decades.Two of the largest of them, China and India, have abundant reserves of coal, the most troublesome fossil fuel in terms of emitting heat-trapping, or greenhouse, gases.Global warming occurs when such gases, chiefly carbon dioxide, accumulate in the atmosphere.Carbon dioxide is produced by the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, the energy underpinnings of the global economy.But the United States is the world's major producer of greenhouse gases, and the American proposal has been deemed critical for the success of the talks.For two days, the delegates gathering at the Beethoven Halle opera house on the Rhine have been anxiously awaiting the American proposal.As details began filtering out of Washington, some reactions were predictable.An important delegate from  
<<the European Union>>
  which favors  
//a  15 percent reduction in emissions  2010,//
He made a dismissive gesture.But some industry representatives considered the proposal quite ambitious. ''
Article no :42
 
//This  will be a  cut,''//
 said  
<<Gail McDonald>>
 It's a very aggressive target.''To  
<<Raul Estrada-Oyuela>>
  of Argentina, the chairman of the Bonn talks,  
//the  Clinton proposal was  modest;//
  
//we  were waiting for a  effort.''//
But,  
<<he>>
  said tonight after watching Mr. Clinton s speech outlining the proposals,  
//''it's  encouraging that the President of the United States takes the issue  seriously.//
''To some delegates, the American proposal looked puny because the 1992 treaty already obligates rich countries to aim at capping emissions at 1990 levels in 2000.Instead, United States emissions in 2000 are expected to be 13 percent higher than they were in 1990. 
<<Some European Union officials>>
  say  
//the  Europeans as a group will meet  goal.//
 
//''It  seems to me that the United States proposal is even less'' than what was originally contained in  treaty,//
 since it would delay the 1990 stabilization goal by 10 years, said Dr.  
<<Mark Mwandosya>>
   
//it  would delay the 1990 stabilization goal by  years,//
But there is another way of looking at what the American proposal would mean.Even before its features were known, Mr. Zammit Cutajar had pointed out that 1990 was not a magic number.The way to measure a proposal, he said, is by gauging what it would actually mean in emissions terms. 
//By  that standard, the United States would reduce its emissions about 25 percent from where it would otherwise be  2010,//
  
<<the Administration>>
  
//''It  would  admittedly,''//
 said  
<<Dr. Mwandosya>>
  especially since  
//the  United States is the biggest emitter of carbon dioxide in  world.//
But is it enough to pull the rest of the world toward stabilization of concentrations?I don't think it is.''Others noted that the United States target and timetable would require countries already below or approaching 1990 levels to do little or nothing.Everyone agrees that it will eventually be necessary to reduce emissions well below 1990 levels if concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are to be stabilized.This is because 1990 levels were already too high; the overall concentration of gases in the atmosphere keeps going up at that level of emissions.Correction:  October 27, 1997, MondayA listing on Thursday of proposals to limit emissions of gases that cause global warming misstated the one offered by Japan.It would cut yearly average emissions from 2008 to 2012 by 5 percent below 1990 levels, not return them to 1990 levels.Correction: October 27, 1997, MondayA listing on Thursday of proposals to limit emissions of gases that cause global warming misstated the one offered by Japan.It would cut yearly average emissions from 2008 to 2012 by 5 percent below 1990 levels, not return them to 1990 levels.
