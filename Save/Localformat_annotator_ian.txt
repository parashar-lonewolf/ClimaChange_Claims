Mr. Bush and Mr. Koizumi were also to discuss global warming.  While  
<<the Japanese>>
  have politely praised  
//Mr.  Bush s recent plan to control  gases//
 as evidence that America is committed to the issue, they have also made clear their hope that  
//the  United States will return to a treaty, negotiated in Kyoto, with other  nations.//
A group of about  
<<50 Japanese and American demonstrators>>
  protested  
//Mr.  Bush s  policies//
This morning, a robust-looking Mr. Bush said that he felt ''great'' as he began his day with a trip to Meiji Jingu, a Shinto shrine.He and Laura Bush, who held hands, were accompanied by a chief priest of the shrine, dressed in full-length cream-colored silk.Mr. Bush spent about 10 minutes inside the shrine, then signed a guest book.From there he left for a display of yabusame, or archery from horses, an ancient Japanese religious practice.In a large field near the shrine, Mr. Bush sat next to Mr. Koizumi and watched as horsemen rode by at a breakneck gallop and shot arrows into a small clay target. ''Oh, yeah!''the president said when one horseman hit the target.
Article no :2
The White House statement on climate change read: ''President Bush announced today that  
<<the United States>>
  has agreed with other industrialized nations that  
//stabilization  of carbon dioxide emissions should be achieved as soon  possible.//
The United States also agreed that it is timely to investigate quantitative targets to limit or reduce carbon dioxide emissions.''That was Nov. 7, 1989, one year after a global heat wave made the environment a top political issue and raised the prospect that people might be affecting the climate by adding carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases to the air, warming the planet as if it were inside a greenhouse.Twelve years later, under a new  
<<President Bush>>
  the  
//urgency On Feb. 14 the president articulated a new approach to what has become a lingering, complicated, politically charged scientific issue.It relies on voluntary efforts to slow, but not halt, the growth in emissions of greenhouse gases.Progress is to be measured by tracking the growth of emissions relative to the growth of the economy.For nearly a year, the president has been saying there is no scientific justification for the specific emissions targets set forth in the Kyoto Protocol, the climate treaty that would require participating industrialized countries to cut emissions by 2012 below their level of 1990.The administration says that when it comes to carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, no one has yet determined how much is too much.But after analyzing details of Mr. Bush s new plan,  
<<many scientists and economists>>
  who study climate data and policy say  
//the  scientific ambiguity that the administration used to justify a limited response  exists,//
''What people sometimes forget is that  
//the  uncertainty in the science  double-edged,''//
 said Dr.  
<<Ronald G. Prinn>>
 ''In our own studies, we estimate about a chance in 20 that the warming in the next 100 years will exceed eight degrees Fahrenheit,'' he said. ''There's no doubt in my mind that eight degrees is something to deeply worry about.The target set by the president's policy to me looks inadequate in the face of that risk.''Underthe administration's plan, carbon dioxide emissions would rise about 14 percent over the next decade -- the same increase that took place over the last decade. ''Can't we do maybe twice what we did in the last 10 years?''Dr.  
<<Prinn>>
  asked, suggesting that  
//the  White House should move more aggressively  emissions.//
Then you'd have much more of a chance of real reductions.''Moreover, many climate experts said,  
//rising  productivity and energy efficiency have been slowing the growth  emissions//
 compared with economic growth for more than a decade -- at the same pace Mr.  
<<Bush>>
 Simply continuing this course, many said, is inadequate to promote the changes needed to flatten the curve of growth -- and eventually turn it downward.The debate over the new plan should reach Capitol Hill this week, when the Senate is expected to consider an energy bill with contentious provisions on oil drilling, gas-mileage standards and other policies that may affect emissions rates.Critics of  
//the   approach//
 include several  
<<members of a scientific committee assembled last year at the behest of the White House by the National Academy of Sciences>>
 Dr. Ralph J. Cicerone chairman of the academy panel and chancellor of the University of California at Irvine, said  
<<the Bush administration>>
  was mistaken to view  
//uncertainty  as a cause  comfort.//
He said there was no longer any ambiguity about whether humans were significant contributors to global warming, and he noted that in the opening line of its report to the White House  
<<the panel>>
  stated plainly that  
//''greenhouse  gases are accumulating in Earth's atmosphere as a result of human activities, causing surface air temperatures and subsurface ocean temperatures  rise.//
''Last week, Dr.  
<<Cicerone>>
  said  
//continued  growth in emissions would make  worse.//
 
//This  situation is  sustainable,//
 and its trajectory is toward dangers,''  
<<he>>
  said, adding that  
//the  White  proposal//
and ''sets goals that are too timid.''The goals were far from modest when  
<<Mr. Bush s father>>
  signed  
//the  first climate treaty,  1992.//
Under that treaty, industrialized nations agreed to strive to reduce their greenhouse emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000.Instead, however, global emissions continued to rise.American releases of greenhouse gases rose more than 12 percent in that period.Last fall, most industrialized nations rallied around a new treaty, the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, though they have yet to ratify it.That treaty, which  
<<the Clinton administration>>
  had signed, would  
//require  participating industrialized countries to cut emissions by 2012 below where they stood  1990.//
Mr.  
<<Bush>>
  rejected  
//the   treaty//
He said that the treaty unfairly required no emissions cuts of fast-growing countries like China and that it would harm the American economy.Last week, Dr.  
<<Conrad C. Lautenbacher Jr.>>
  a mathematician and retired Navy vice admiral, who is the under secretary of commerce for oceans and atmosphere, said  
//Mr.  Bush's  plan//
You're playing with a $12 trillion economy here,'' Dr. Lautenbacher said. ''There's such a large connection with our economy based on what we do and to what degree we do it that we'd be foolish not to try to understand the basic processes better.''The new policy is also attracting support from scientists who are skeptical that global warming is a serious long-term threat.More aggressive moves, they say, would harm the economy and waste resources that could be used to solve other problems.Indeed, some skeptics say Mr.  
<<Bush>>
  s policy concedes too much by even acknowledging that  
//voluntary  changes  needed.//
''Voluntaryhas a nasty habit of turning mandatory,'' said  
<<S. Fred Singer>>
  a climatologist, who has long criticized  
//the  consensus view  warming//
 
<<Dr. Singer>>
  says recent studies have steadily whittled away at  
//the  direst predictions  warming.//
''Every bit of data,''  
<<he>>
  said, ''seems to confirm that  
//the  climate sensitivity is well below even the lowest  given''//
But the lead author of one of the new studies, Dr.  
<<James E. Hansen>>
  the director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, says there is a difference between refining projections of change and  
//saying  global warming is not a  problem.//
In a paper in a recent issue of The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences Dr.  
<<Hansen>>
  and a Goddard colleague, Dr. Makiko Sato, plotted the changing concentrations of various greenhouse gases and predicted that  
//the  average global temperature would rise 1.3 degrees over the next  years.//
That is at the low end of predictions for warming generated by most computer models of climate, but more than temperatures rose over the last 100 years.The paper concluded that the warming trend was likely to be substantially slower than previously thought, given the slowing buildup of greenhouse gases other than carbon dioxide.For example, Dr. Hansen said, methane, a potent greenhouse gas that was once rapidly building in the atmosphere, has shown a sharp decline in its growth rate since 1980, for reasons scientists cannot explain.The scientists also calculated that a concerted effort to raise fuel efficiency and find ways to remove carbon dioxide from the air could well cause emissions to stop growing altogether later in the century and, eventually, to decline.But over all, Dr.  
<<Hansen>>
  said, the Goddard analysis still means that  
//temperatures  by 2050 will be more than two degrees warmer than they were at the beginning of the  century,//
''I could see keeping the warming relatively moderate, but I point out that even a two-degree warming is going to make the earth very warm compared to the history of the last millions of years,'' Dr. Hansen said.And,  
<<he>>
  noted, if  
//emissions  continue to rise just 1 percent  year//
Still, Dr.  
<<Hansen>>
  said he remained optimistic that societies would rise to the challenge, adding that natural evidence of a strong human contribution to global warming was likely to pile up in the next few years -- along with  
//a  consensus for more action to  it.//
''We'll be seeing how things are going well before 10 years are out,'' Dr. Hansen said.

The last time America dominated the world as overwhelmingly as it does today was in the wake of World War II.So why did that America not inspire the sort of global anger that today's America does?Partly it's because the rest of the world was flat on its back then.But more important, it's because America after World War II took responsibility for making the world both a more secure place to live and a better place to live.And it expended a lot of resources, as in the Marshall Plan, to do both.

Since Sept. 11, the  
<<Bush>>
  team has focused on making the world safer, but has shown little interest in  
//making  it more healthy, less poor and more  sound.//
As a result, there has been little chance that it was going to end up safer for Americans.Therefore, President  
<<Bush>>
  s speech on Thursday announcing  
//a  $5 billion increase in foreign aid for  countries//
Since Sept. 11, President Bush has often noted that the world has fundamentally changed.Yet, time after time, he has exploited the shock of Sept. 11 to argue why his same old, pre-Sept. 11 policies were still the only way to proceed -- only more so.Because of Sept. 11, he has argued, we need even deeper tax cuts for the wealthy, even more money for a pie-in-the-sky missile defense that would have been no use on Sept. 11, an even bigger defense budget and even more drilling for oil in wilderness areas.The most obvious conclusion from Sept. 11 -- that  
//fighting  terrorism around the globe will require a new,  strategy,//
 not just a defense strategy -- was the one Mr.  
<<Bush>>
 It will be relevant, though, only if it really signals an understanding by the Bush team that there are no walls for us to hide behind anymore, that everything is connected to everything else and that we cannot win a global war against terrorism without global allies, but we will have those allies only if we practice what the architects of the Marshall Plan practiced: enlightened self-interest, not just self-interest.Those postwar wise men persuaded others to follow us because they not only respected our power but also our wisdom and moral example.The 9/11 terrorists did not hit us because they were poor.But millions of poor people gave passive support to those terrorists because they resented our greed or our support for their bad regimes.That's why it was important that the president said our increased foreign aid must be conditioned on countries' improving their governance, rule of law, social safety nets, investment climates and anticorruption practices.We can't force elections, but we can use our aid to pressure developing countries to give their people more voice, more rule of law and a fairer slice of the pie, which are their people's real priorities.Here's a tip: The reason Islam seems like such an angry religion today is because so many Muslims are angry.The reason so many Muslims are angry is because most of them live under antidemocratic regimes backed by America, with lagging economies and shrinking opportunities for young people.Beyond just aid, though, we should also be forging free trade accords with as many Muslim nations as possible (instead of throwing up insane protectionist walls around our steel industry).At the Davos economic forum, one expert noted that Muslim countries made up 20 percent of the world's population, yet only 4 percent of the world's trade.Trade in goods brings trade in ideas.The most open, tolerant places in the Muslim world today are all trading centers:Dubai, Istanbul, Bahrain, Amman, Beirut, Jakarta, coastal India.But enlightened self-interest is not just about generosity; it's also about self-restraint.We need to find a way to ratify the Kyoto climate change treaty.It's not only the right thing to do, but it would also send a hugely positive signal to the world -- that America understands that if it's going to have lasting allies in a global war on terrorism, it has to be the best global citizen it can be.The attitude that we are entitled to consume 25 percent of the world's energy, while we're only 4 percent of the world's population, is obnoxious.Selfishness and hubris are a terrible combination.Mr. Bush has repeatedly told the world: If you're not with us, you're against us.He needs to remember this: The rest of the world is saying the same thing to us.

To the Editor: Re ''Large Ice Shelf in Antarctica Disintegrates at Great Speed'' (news article, March 20): The dramatic satellite images documenting the breakup of the Larson B ice shelf in Antarctica are a sharp reminder of how global warming can cause rapid, large-scale change.Critics of the Kyoto climate treaty point out that the global system is extremely complicated and any predictions are fraught with potential error.This is undoubtedly true; catastrophe need not accompany global warming.However, the sudden collapse of a 12,000-year-old ice shelf the size of Rhode Island indicates that the risk of fossil fuel dependence may be far too high.The technology exists to greatly increase our use of renewable energy resources.Failure to act ensures several things: more oil spills, more pollution in the lungs of city dwellers, more terrorists, more alliances with inhumane regimes.Not to mention the unlikely but horrible possibility of a global climate so altered as to cause environmental damage and human suffering more vast than any war.STEPHEN GRANT  West Newton, Mass., March 21, 2002
Article no :5
THE Enron-Andersen debacle has cast an unforgiving light on corporate bookkeeping, but the growing demand for accountability could extend far beyond financial statements.Pressure from investors, customers, consumer activists and even some governments is pushing more companies, particularly multinational ones, to report their nonfinancial performance, detailing the impact of their businesses on the environment and human rights.This so-called social reporting has been under way since the late 1980's, when corporations, reacting to the growing environmental movement, began publishing brochures about reducing pollution.But many of those early efforts produced little more than glossy propaganda.In the last few years, the forces of globalization and increased access to information via the Internet have helped to expand the scope of social reporting.In addition to providing environmental, health and safety reporting, companies are beginning to report on all aspects of their social performance, from the amount of waste they reuse to the wages they pay to workers abroad.Advocates of this more rigorous reporting, which they call ''sustainability reporting,'' say it provides the most accurate appraisal of a company's potential and risk.''As your number of suppliers andthe number of people looking at you goes up, you need new tools for measurement,'' said Robert Massie a founder and director of the Global Reporting Initiative, a group based in Boston that has been working with the  
<<United Nations>>
  to  
//devise  internationally accepted standards for  reporting.//
Leading indicators are not just financial.''More companies may decide that such reporting is good for business.A 1999 survey of 25,000 people worldwide by Environics International, a research firm, showed that 56 percent formed opinions of a company based on its social behavior, versus 34 percent based on financial fundamentals like profits.Forty percent said they had boycotted or considered boycotting companies they viewed as irresponsible.A handful of companies, like Royal Dutch/Shell, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, General Motors and Ford Motor, have been producing sustainability reports since the middle to late 1990's.A Web site that tracks social reporting, CorporateRegister. com, counts 487 sustainability reports published last year, up from 194 in 1995 and 7 in 1990.(Social reports of all kinds, including environmental and afety, number in the thousands.)The biggest new entry is McDonald's, which plans to release its first sustainability report the week of April 15.With operations in 121 countries, McDonald's symbolizes the expansion of American business and has been a lightning rod for activists protesting everything from American culture to genetically modified food.Bob Langert, the company's senior director for social responsibility, said the publication of a sustainability report was not prompted by any one incident. ''There is more interest in what companies like McDonald's are doing with social-type issues,'' he said. ''We want to provide a full view of where we've been, where we're at and where we're going.''Its 50-page report will address issues like beef safety, a suppliers' code of conduct and the company's treatment of overseas employees and franchise owners.Other companies working on such reports for the first time include Alcoa, International Paper and Siemens. ''There's no doubt that the world at large is looking at the broader imprint that companies leave on society,'' said Jake Siewert, a vice president at Alcoa.In another sign that social reporting is growing, some large accounting firms are jumping in, looking to expand their auditing and consulting services.Only 40 percent of social reports are now audited. ''A lot of our clients and our clients' clients are asking for this,'' said Sunil Misser, partner in charge of a new practice for corporate social programs at PriceWaterhouseCoopers.Still, there are no common standards or oversight groups, leaving wide variability in the reports and audits.For auditors, the conflicts on the financial side -- relationships that provide more than one service to clients -- can be true on the social side as well.A bigger problem to overcome may be public skepticism of corporations fed by scandals, such as the collapse of Enron and indictment of its auditor, Arthur Andersen.VOLUNTARY self-reporting by corporations lacks credibility, said David C. Korten, the author of ''When Corporations Rule the World,'' a 1995 book considered the bible of the movement against globalization. ''If we cannot trust management to put out an honest report to shareholders,'' he said, ''it would be silly to put any credibility in these social reports.''Many companies may view social reports as an opportunity to ''greenwash'' -- to highlight the good and omit the bad -- with glossy images of employees planting trees, butterflies or cupped hands holding a globe. ''We want to see specific targets that can be measured year to year,'' said Paul Scott, director of NextStep Consulting, a British firm that helps companies create these reports and runs the CorporateRegister. com database.Still, he said, ''producing a report is a good way to get management to sit up and take notice.''Indeed, social reporting, once a squishy exercise, is becoming more serious.The Global Reporting Initiative drafted guidelines a few years ago, and 100 big companies are following them.In Europe, some countries -- the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway and France -- require some sort of social reporting.More than  
<<200 companies>>
  have signed  
//the  United Nations Global Compact which commits them to a code  conduct//
The code has no enforcement provisions, but supporters say it is symbolically important, much as the Sullivan Principles were in pressuring South Africa to end apartheid.AT Shell, which will publish its fifth sustainability report next month, there is a conspicuous sensitivity about consulting with local groups in the planning of new projects.A pipeline completed last fall in the Philippines, for example, was routed to avoid sacred burial sites, coral beds and fishing grounds.That contrasts with Shell's old behavior, which caused a public backlash that hurt its reputation.In 1995, for example, when the company announced plans to sink an oil platform in the North Atlantic and worked with a repressive regime in Nigeria,  
<<protesters>>
  denounced the company and  
//Shell Mark Wade, the sustainable-development manager at Shell, said those protests ''triggered our understanding of the importance of building relationships.''InShell's sustainability report, the company offers an annual measure of how it is doing on its commitments, like reducing emissions that many scientists say contribute to global warming. 
<<Shell>>
  s upcoming report, it said, would show  
//the  company had reduced such emissions by nearly 10 percent  1990//
In contrast, the Kyoto treaty to stop global warming, which the United States has not signed, sets a 2002 goal of a 5.2 percent reduction from 1990 levels.In a move that advocates of social reporting say foreshadows corporate reporting to come, Shell will include its sustainability report in the same binding as its annual financial report for the first time this year, underscoring the message that the two go hand in hand.Most companies that publish social reports now do so separately from their financial reports.The Centre for Tomorrow's Corporation, a business-sponsored research group in London, said Shell's move portended an overhaul of the corporate annual report. ''The future is inclusive reporting,'' said Mark Goyder, the group's director. ''We want the finance director, not the environmental director, lying awake at night wondering if he has the right social performance metrics.''

After a year of urging from energy lobbyists, the administration is seeking the ouster of an American scientist who heads a global warming panel.After a year of urging from energy industry lobbyists, the  
<<Bush administration>>
  is seeking  
//the  ouster of an American scientist who for nearly six years has directed an international panel of hundreds of experts assessing  warming,//
The specialist,  
//Dr.  Robert  Watson//
 chief scientist of the World Bank, is highly regarded as an atmospheric chemist by  
<<many climate experts.>>
 He has held the unpaid position of chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change since the fall of 1996.Now his term is expiring and  
<<the State Department>>
  has chosen not  
//to  renominate him to head  panel,//
 
<<Dr. Watson>>
  is an outspoken advocate of the idea that  
//human  actions -- mainly burning oil and coal -- are contributing to global warming and must be changed to avert  upheavals.//
Last night, a State Department official said the administration was leaning toward endorsing a scientist from  
<<India,>>
  which along with other developing countries has been  
//eager  for a stronger role in the  assessments.//
But  
<<many influential climate experts>>
  say they have written to the department supporting  
//Dr.   Watson//
One of those letters was sent last month by Dr. Ralph J. Cicerone, an atmospheric scientist who is chancellor of the University of California, Irvine, and chairman of a National Academy of Sciences panel that assessed the international panel's climate analyses last year at the behest of the White House.In an e-mail message sent to the State Department  
<<Dr. Cicerone>>
  urged  
//the  administration not to withdraw its support for  Watson//
 and, if it did, at least to  
//replace  him with another  scientist.//
Otherwise, ''such a change would greatly reduce the emphasis on science in I.P.C.C.,'' he said, referring to the climate panel.He also said it would be ''very, very difficult to find anyone better than Watson.''But energy industry lobbyists and some  
<<Republican elected officials>>
  have criticized  
//Dr.   Watson//
 as biased and focused on  
//building  a scientific argument to justify cutting the use of coal  oil.//
In a letter to the White House a year ago, for example,  
<<Dr. Arthur G. Randol>>

//Dr.  Watson used leaks of drafts of his panel's climate reports to further his  agenda.//
''''Can Watson be replaced now at the request of the U.S.?'' read the letter.A copy was given to The New York Times by the Natural Resources Defense Council, a private environmental group.Dr. Randol did not respond yesterday to requests for comment.But White House officials said his letter had no bearing on decisions about the panel.The only other significant candidate nominated for panel chairman is Dr. Rajendra K. Pachauri, an Indian engineer and economist who is now one of five vice chairmen.He is highly regarded, but many scientists said his lack of grounding in atmospheric science made him an unsuitable choice.Nevertheless several

The panel's assessments of climate change underpinned negotiations leading to two climate treaties, the latest of them the Kyoto Protocol, which calls for cuts in emissions of heat-trapping gases.President Bush rejected it a year ago.The panel's findings have been criticized as overly dire by energy industry officials and a few scientists.But many other experts have endorsed

I blame him for squandering all the positive feeling in America after 9/11, particularly among young Americans who wanted to be drafted for a great project that would strengthen America in some lasting way -- a Manhattan project for energy independence.Such a project could have enlisted young people in a national movement for greater conservation and enlisted science and industry in a crash effort to produce enough renewable energy, efficiencies and domestic production to wean us gradually off oil imports.Such a project would not only have made us safer by making us independent of countries who share none of our values.It would also have made us safer by giving the world a much stronger reason to support our war on terrorism.There is no way we can be successful in this war without partners, and there is no way America will have lasting partners, especially in Europe, unless it is perceived as being the best global citizen it can be.And the best way to start conveying that would be by reducing our energy gluttony and ratifying the Kyoto treaty to reduce global warming.President Bush is not alone in this failure.

The E.L.F. set off its first major firebomb, in fact, the year after Clinton's 1995 timber-salvage-rider dispute.The salvage rider made it easy for logging companies to harvest trees they claimed were diseased or damaged.It was a sweet deal for the timber industry, a setback for environmentalists.For hardcore greens it was Clinton's Judas moment.Following the slow disenchantment of the Clinton era, radical environmentalists are now faced with

 Up until now, they haven't harmed the people they're trying to harm,'' says Gary Perlstein, the domestic-terrorism expert. ''When they destroy a tree farm in Clatskanie, Ore., they're not hurting the Weyerhaeusers of the world.I worry that they're going to eventually see that.And then the true believers among them may say, 'Well, maybe we have to assassinate the president of Weyerhaeuser.'''The E.L.F.'s rhetoric hasn't gone that far yet, but its supporters describe the war they're waging in increasingly dire terms. ''If someone had their hands around your throat strangling you, would you gather petition signatures to present to them, politely asking them to stop?'' asks a recent issue of Resistance, a quarterly E.L.F. zine. ''Would you go limp as a symbolic gesture of your noncooperation?Hopefully you would defend yourself by any means necessary.''I put the question to Craig Marshall:In a perfect world, what would we do to save the earth? ''First, knock down all the concrete,'' he says.Thinking further, he adds: ''The problem is, we've gone too far already.There's no easy solution.For life to survive as we know it, millions of people are going to have to die.It's sad to say that, but it's true.Millions of people are already dying -- it's just gonna have to start happening here.''That's a pretty chilling statement, I tell him.''I'm not saying anybody needs to be executed,'' he says. ''But there's a need for decreasing the population.Look, I don't take life.I fight to protect it.I'm doing the best I can to make sure life survives.Not only human life -- all the other life that humans are extinguishing.''BruceBarcott is a contributing editor at Outside magazine.

Under the presidency of  
<<George W. Bush>>
  the  
//environmental  and energy policies of our government are completely dominated by a group of current and former oil and chemical  executives//
 who are trying  
//to  dismantle America's ability to force them to reduce the extremely dangerous levels  pollution//
The first step was to withdraw from the agreement reached in Kyoto to begin limiting worldwide emissions of greenhouse gases.Then the administration cancelled an agreement requiring automobile companies to make the leap to more fuel-efficient vehicles.Other acts of sabotage are taking place behind the scenes.Just as Enron executives were allowed to interview candidates for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission -- and to veto those they didn't think would approve of Enron's agenda --  
//ExxonMobil  has been allowed to veto the <CANDIDATE> United States government's <ACTOR> selection of who will head the prestigious  panel//
 
//Dr.  Robert Watson the highly respected leader of the Inter-Governmental Panel on  Change,//
 was blackballed in a memo to the White House from  
<<the nation's largest oil company.>>
 The memo had its effect last Friday, when Dr. Watson lost his bid for re-election after the  
<<administration>>
  threw its weight behind the ''let's drag our feet'' candidate,  
//Dr.  Rajendra Pachauri of  Delhi,//
Why is this happening?Because the largest polluters know their only hope for escaping restrictions lies in promoting confusion about global warming.Just as Enron needed auditors who wouldn't blow the whistle when the company lied about the magnitude of its future liabilities, the  
<<administration>>
  needs  
//scientific  reviews that won't sound the alarm on the destruction of the earth's  balance.//
How long they get away with it depends on how long they can sow confusion and doubt.But with folks wearing bikinis in Boston in the middle of April and with the massive melting of ice at both poles and in nearly every mountain glacier on earth, public awareness and concern are growing rapidly.At a time when the world needs enduring leadership from the United States to rally all nations to join in a concerted effort to stop global warming, the administration is working overtime to block any progress whatsoever.So tomorrow, on this Earth Day, more than ever before, we need real, forward-thinking leadership and a renewed focus on the environment.True leadership means ensuring that we take the necessary steps to leave a cleaner environment for generations to come -- and that means strengthening environmental protections.Instead, this administration's so-called Clean Skies initiative actually increases air pollution levels by allowing more toxic mercury, nitrogen oxide and sulfur emissions than does current law.Put simply, on the environment, this administration has consistently sold out America's future in return for short-term political gains.True leadership means guaranteeing our national security and role as a world leader -- and one of the best ways to do this is by decreasing our dangerous dependence on foreign oil, so that America cannot be held hostage to oil imports and tinhorn tyrants like Saddam Hussein.But instead this administration is now investing less in energy innovation and conservation and more in corporate subsidies for oil exploration and extraction and nuclear power.True leadership means assuring an economy that rewards innovation and productivity.We can do so by leading the world in investments in technological innovations that will result in environment-friendly products like more efficient cars and renewable energy sources.Such investments would open up the door for new economic growth.But this administration is taking only those steps that increase our addiction to fossil fuels and outdated and inefficient technologies.On all these fronts, this administration has walked away from the tough choices and has instead chosen to subsidize the solutions of the past.Instead of leading, it has attempted to mislead.Instead of sharing a vision with the people, the administration has given access to special interests.We can return to the path of progress, on which we value economic growth that rewards innovation and productivity and meets the needs of our families and of national security.We can return to the days of record growth coupled with record improvement in the air we breathe.We can return to true leadership on the environment.We ought to look at the environment as a critical piece of the nation we will be.I urge Americans to re-engage in a forward-looking discussion of how to secure our nation's energy needs while pursuing environmental policies that will make us safer, more efficient and more respectful stewards of our planet and our nation's great potential.Al Gore, vice president from 1993 to 2001, is a professor at Fisk University and Middle Tennessee State University.
Article no :9
I blame him for squandering all the positive feeling in America after 9/11, particularly among young Americans who wanted to be drafted for a great project that would strengthen America in some lasting way -- a Manhattan project for energy independence.Such a project could have enlisted young people in a national movement for greater conservation and enlisted science and industry in a crash effort to produce enough renewable energy, efficiencies and domestic production to wean us gradually off oil imports.Such a project would not only have made us safer by making us independent of countries who share none of our values.It would also have made us safer by giving the world a much stronger reason to support our war on terrorism.There is no way we can be successful in this war without partners, and there is no way America will have lasting partners, especially in Europe, unless it is perceived as being the best global citizen it can be.And the best way to start conveying that would be by reducing our energy gluttony and ratifying the Kyoto treaty to reduce global warming.President Bush is not alone in this failure. 
//He This has made it easy for Mr. Bush, and his oil-industry paymasters, to get away with it.We and our kids are going to regret this.Because a war on terrorism that is fought only by sending soldiers to Afghanistan or by tightening our borders will ultimately be unsatisfying.Such a war is important, but it can never be definitively won.Someone will always slip through.But a war on terrorism that, with some imagination, is broadly defined as making America safer by also making it better is a war that could be won.It's a war that could ensure that something lasting comes out of 9/11, other than longer lines at the airport -- and that something would be enhanced respect for America and a country and a planet that would be greener, cleaner and safer in the broadest sense.Too bad we don't have a president who could imagine that.
Article no :10
Carrying the comparisons to World War II and the cold war to the next step, the president said Sept. 11 marked a change of eras as dramatic as Pearl Harbor or the first days of the Berlin blockade, when the United States had to mount an airlift to keep the Western-controlled parts of the city fed. 
<<He>>
  carefully stepped around the most contentious subjects of disagreement, including his rejection of  
//the   Protocol//
 on global warming, his refusal to sign  
//the  treaty creating the International  Court//
He started off by thanking the members of Parliament, as they sat in purple seats before jet-black desks, for coming into a special session to hear him. ''I can just imagine how my Congress would react if I called them back to hear a speech of mine when they were on vacation,'' he said to laughter.As he spoke, Mr. Bush's wife, Laura, who has been touring Europe in recent days, and members of his foreign policy team sat in the sleek glass-and-metal galleries that give the new home of Parliament an airy look inside the walls of the 108-year-old Reichstag building.Also along for the trip, which will include Russia, France and Italy, were Karen Hughes the influential counselor who is leaving  
<<the White House>>
  this summer, and, notably,  
//Karl   Rove,//
 his longtime policy adviser, whose presence seemed to underscore  
//the  expansion of his domestic political portfolio to  matters.//
Quickly, Mr. Bush and his team received a lesson in the politics of modern Europe.No sooner had they entered the chamber than Mr. Bush was both welcomed and directly challenged by the Parliament's president, Wolfgang Thierse, a member of Mr. Schröder's Social Democrats.Mr.  
<<Thierse>>
  complimented the American president for taking the time  
//to  assemble a coalition to  terrorism,//
''Butthen Mr.  
<<Thierse>>
  warned, in comments clearly aimed at the visiting president, that  
//the  need for such coalitions extends to  arenas.//
The pursuit of unilateral interests proves short-sighted more and more frequently,''  
<<he>>
  said, urging Mr. Bush to  
//''continue  together on the road mapped out by the Kyoto protocol'' and to ratify the  treaty.//
Mr.  
<<Bush>>
  made it clear earlier in the day that he has no intention of  
//reconsidering  his opposition to the  treaty.//
In his whirlwind tour here, Mr. Bush did no sightseeing.His motorcade speeded through a sealed-off downtown, past both the reminders of the Nazi era and the cranes that are creating a new Berlin in the spaces left after the wall tumbled.He acknowledged at one point this morning his frustration at not seeing more, and not speaking to ordinary Germans -- the closest he came was an invitation-only crowd at a restaurant where he had dessert with Mr. Schröder on Wednesday night.

<<Chirac>>
  facing some parliamentary elections in two weeks, pointed out that  
//the  United States consumes too much of the  energy.//
In case Mr. Bush missed it the first time, on Sunday, Mr. Chirac repeated it at Normandy today.And on Sunday he needled the president a bit for signing a farm bill that subsidizes American farmers while American negotiators are telling Europe to let their farmers discover the workings of the free market.Then there is Mr. Putin, who is trying to turn a weak hand into some cold cash.Once an opponent of missile defenses, he now wants a piece of the contracts to build the system's interceptors.Once interested in an alliance with China against American power, he is now interested jumping aboard the unilateralist bandwagon.At St. Petersburg State University, Mr. Putin's alma mater, not a single student berated Mr. Putin's guest over the Kyoto Protocol on global warming, steel tariffs or Iraq.Instead, they asked what made him a good manager.

In a stark shift for the  
<<Bush administration,>>
  the United States has  
//sent  a climate report to the United Nations detailing the far-reaching effects of  warming.//
In a stark shift for the Bush administration,  
<<the United States>>
  has  
//sent  a climate report to the United Nations detailing specific and far-reaching effects that it says global warming will inflict on the  environment.//
In the report, the administration for the first time mostly blames human actions for recent global warming.It says the main culprit is the burning of fossil fuels that send heat-trapping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.But while the report says the United States will be substantially changed in the next few decades -- ''very likely'' seeing the disruption of snow-fed water supplies, more stifling heat waves and the permanent disappearance of Rocky Mountain meadows and coastal marshes, for example-- it does not propose any major shift in the administration's policy on greenhouse gases.It recommends adapting to inevitable changes.It does not recommend  
//making  rapid reductions in greenhouse gases to  warming,//
 the approach favored by many environmental groups and countries that have accepted the Kyoto Protocol, a climate treaty written in the Clinton administration that was rejected by Mr.  
<<Bush.>>
   
//countries  that have accepted the  Protocol,//
The new document, '  
<<U.S.>>
  Climate Action Report 2002,'' strongly concludes that no matter what is done to cut emissions in the future,  
//nothing  can be done about the environmental consequences of several decades' worth of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases already in  atmosphere.//
Its emphasis on adapting to the inevitable fits in neatly with the climate plan Mr. Bush announced in February.
He called for voluntary measures that would allow gas emissions to continue to rise, with the goal of slowing the rate of growth.
Yet the new report's predictions present a sharp contrast to previous statements on climate change by the administration, which has always spoken in generalities and emphasized the need for much more research to resolve scientific questions.The report, in fact, puts a substantial distance between the administration and companies that produce or, like automakers, depend on fossil fuels.Many companies and trade groups have continued to run publicity and lobbying campaigns questioning the validity of the science pointing to damaging results of global warming.The distancing could be an effort to rebuild Mr.  
<<Bush>>
  s environmental credentials after a bruising stretch of defeats on stances that  
//favor  energy production  conservation,//
 notably the failure to win a Senate vote  
//opening  the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to exploratory  drilling.//
But the report has alienated environmentalists, too.Late last week, after it was posted on the Web site of the Environmental Protection Agency  
<<private environmental groups>>
  pounced on it, saying it pointed to a jarring disconnect between  
//the  administration's findings on the climate problem and its  solutions.//
''The 
<<Bush>>
  administration now admits that  
//global  warming will change America's most unique wild places and  forever,''//
'How can it acknowledge global warming is a disaster in the making and then refuse to help solve the problem, especially when solutions are
so clear?''Scott McClellan a  
<<White House>>
  spokesman, said, ''It is important to  
//move  forward on the president's strategies for addressing the challenge of  change,//
''Many  
<<companies and trade groups>>
  had sought last year to tone down  
//parts  of the report, the third prepared by the United States under the requirements of a 1992  treaty//
For the most part, the document does not reflect industry's wishes, which were conveyed in letters during a period of public comment on a draft last year.The report emphasizes that global warming carries potential benefits for the nation, including increased agricultural and forest growth from longer growing seasons, and from more rainfall and carbon dioxide for photosynthesis.But it says environmental havoc is coming as well. ''Some of the goods and services lost through the disappearance or fragmentation of natural ecosystems are likely to be costly or impossible to replace,'' the report says.The report also warns of the substantial disruption of snow-fed water supplies, the loss of coastal and mountain ecosystems and more frequent heat waves. ''A few ecosystems, such as alpine meadows in the Rocky Mountains and some barrier islands, are likely to disappear entirely in some areas,'' it says. ''Other ecosystems, such as Southeastern forests, are likely to experience major species shifts or break up into a mosaic of grasslands, woodlands and forests.''Despitearguments by oil industry groups that the evidence is not yet clear, the report unambiguously states that humans are the likely cause of most of the recent warming.Phrases were adopted wholesale from  
//a  National Academy of Sciences  study,//
 which was requested last spring by the  
<<White House>>
 A government official familiar with the new report said that it had been under review at the White House from January until mid-April, but that few substantive changes were made.Without a news release or announcement, the new report was shipped last week to the United Nations offices that administer the treaty and posted on the Web (www.epa .gov/globalwarming/publications /car/).A senior administration official involved in climate policy played down the significance of the report, explaining that policies on emissions or international treaties would not change as a result.Global warming has become a significant, if second-tier, political issue recently, particularly since James M. Jeffords, the Vermont independent, became chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee last year.Mr.  
<<Jeffords>>
  has criticized  
//the   policy.//
The new report is the latest in a series on greenhouse gases, climate research, energy policies and related matters that are required of signatories to  
//the  United Nations Framework Convention on  Change//
 which was signed by  
<<Mr. Bush's father>>
 The convention lacks binding obligations to reduce gas emissions like those in the Kyoto Protocol.Mr. Bush and administration officials had previously been careful to avoid specifics and couch their views on coming climate shifts with substantial caveats.The president and his aides often described climate change as a ''serious issue,'' but rarely as a serious problem.The report contains some caveats of its own, but states that the warming trend has been under way for several decades and is likely to continue.''Because of the momentum in the climate system and natural climate variability, adapting to a changing climate is inevitable,'' the report says. ''The question is whether we adapt poorly or well.''Severalindustry groups said the qualifications in parts of the report were welcome, but added that the overall message was still more dire than the facts justified and would confuse policy makers.Dr.  
<<Russell O. Jones>>
  a senior economist for the American Petroleum Institute who wrote a letter to the Environmental Protection Agency a year ago seeking to  
//purge  projections of specific environmental impacts from  report,//
''Addingthe caveats is useful, but the results are still as meaningless,'' Dr. Jones said.
Article no :14
As it is required to do under international treaty, the Bush administration has sent to the United Nations a report on global warming that is much more pessimistic than its earlier calculations about the environmental damage that unchecked warming could cause.A White House spokesman, Scott McClellan, said the report is reason ''to move forward on the president's strategies for addressing the challenge of climate change.'' There is only one thing wrong with this picture.President Bush has no serious strategies for climate change.Indeed, Mr. Bush has essentially withdrawn from the field. 
<<He>>
  rejected the Kyoto accord on climate change and repudiated a campaign pledge  
//to  seek firm limits on  dioxide,//
He then proposed a voluntary scheme.It appears from the U.N. report to consist largely of finding ways to adapt to warming instead of preventing it.Congress has done no better.The only encouraging news is on the state level.Massachusetts and New Hampshire have approved bills aimed at cutting power plant emissions of carbon dioxide.In New York, a commission appointed by  
<<Gov. George Pataki>>
  will shortly give him a set of aggressive recommendations to  
//help  the state reduce its emissions of  gases.//
Encouraging as the state actions are, global warming requires a national response.There is one last chance to get the ball rolling in Congress this term and to send a positive signal to other countries.The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee will soon begin writing a comprehensive air pollution bill.The committee has before it a strong proposal framed by the chairman, James Jeffords, and a less ambitious but useful plan advanced by a few power companies that have at last faced up to their obligation to address the issue.There is no comparable Bush initiative on the table.The Jeffords and industry plans address the four major pollutants: mercury; nitrogen oxides that produce smog; sulfur dioxide, which causes acid rain; and carbon dioxide.Mr. Bush's sketchy ''Clear Skies'' proposal addresses only the first three.To Mr. Jeffords, that makes the Bush plan a nonstarter.What's interesting is that some of the president's putative allies among the power companies -- including Northeastern utilities like Consolidated Edison and Public Service Electric and Gas of New Jersey -- see things the same way.The reason is summed up in what managers like to call ''business certainty.''They know that carbon dioxide will eventually be regulated, and they would like to begin now to tailor investment strategies to deal with all four pollutants at once.The technologies that work for mercury, sulfur and nitrogen oxide -- so-called ''end of pipe'' controls like scrubbers -- do virtually nothing to reduce carbon dioxide.But there are other strategies -- switching to cleaner fuels, investing in ''clean coal'' technologies and alternative fuels, making existing plants more efficient -- that could help utilities respond to clean air concerns in a more coordinated, cost-efficient way.Unfortunately,  
<<the biggest and dirtiest utilities,>>
  which make the most noise in Congress and are also among Mr. Bush's biggest contributors, hate  
//the   approach//
Senator Jeffords's task is to make sure that his bill commands a big enough majority in his committee to justify bringing it to the Senate floor, where a brutal battle awaits.The Senate may be as far as any bill goes -- the House has not been hospitable to imaginative thinking on energy and the environment.But it's important to get a good plan on the table before the fall elections, and to start moving the country along the right path.The choices could not be clearer.One is to continue to rely on older technologies that condemn us to a future of polluted cities and further warming.The other is to redesign our energy system so as to reduce America's dependence on carbon-based fuels and send a signal to the rest of the world that we are finally getting serious about climate change.
Article no :15
Japan ratified an international accord on limiting emissions of heat-trapping gasses on Tuesday, and said it would lobby the United States to do the same.Japan ratified an international accord on limiting emissions of heat-trapping gasses today, ending more than six months of internal debate, and said it would lobby the United States and other large polluters to do the same.Japan's ratification of the agreement, despite the opposition of many major industries, was an important step forward for the accord, known as the Kyoto Protocol on global warming.''In order to ensure the effectiveness of measures against global warming, it is essential that all countries make efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,''Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi said in a statement.Japan is the fourth-largest emitter of carbon dioxide, which is produced by the burning of fossil fuels and is believed to be the most important heat-trapping gas and the main cause of global warming.The leading polluters are the United States, the European Union and Russia.To meet the politically complex conditions for the Kyoto accord to become international law, it must be ratified by at least 55 countries and by the industrialized nations that emitted at least 55 percent of the industrialized world's carbon dioxide in 1990.Despite the rejection of  
//Kyoto The 15 countries of the European Union, acting in unison, presented their ratifications of the protocol on Friday, but the United States and Russia have not agreed to its terms.The

  administration has  
//rejected  the agreement on economic and scientific grounds, saying that emissions reductions would  costly,//
Recently, however, the United States has acknowledged a link between human activity and global warming.Russia, whose cabinet has given preliminary approval to the accord, is holding out for extra credits toward emissions targets and may not ratify it until next year, say people who are following the issue.Under the protocol, industrialized nations would be required to cut emissions of greenhouse gases by an average of 5 percent over the period 2008 through 2012, compared with 1990 levels.Japan has pledged to cut its emissions by 6 percent over this period.Environmentalists point to a substantial rise in Japan's output of greenhouse gasses since 1990 and say the country will have difficulty meeting its target. ''Japan is going to be very behind in its efforts to achieve its target without new measures,'' said Yurika Ayukawa, of World Wide Fund for Nature Japan, according to Reuters news service.Japan's ratification of the protocol appeared in doubt late last year, with the powerful Finance and Foreign Ministries reportedly joining to oppose it.

Under intense criticism from  
<<conservatives,>>
  President Bush distanced himself today from  
//a  report by his administration concluding that humans were to blame for far-reaching effects of global warming on  environment.//
The report, drafted by the Environmental Protection Agency and reviewed by several other agencies and the White House, was sent to the United Nations early last week.The report said the United States would be substantially changed in the next few decades by global warming, although it called for no rapid response.Reporters asked Mr. Bush about the report today.''I read the report put out by the bureaucracy,'' he said.He said he still opposed the Kyoto treaty, which Japan ratified today.The treaty calls for the mandatory reduction of greenhouse gases by industrial nations.Critics across the political spectrum said that Mr. Bush was trying to appear more moderate to environmentalists while signaling to conservatives and industry that he would not promote the views contained in the report.Mr. Bush's spokesman emphasized that the report carried numerous caveats about the uncertainty that still exists about the science of climate change.Ari Fleischer, the spokesman, obviously anticipating a question about the report at the daily White House briefing, said: ''There is 'considerable uncertainty' -- that's in this recent report -- relating to the science of climate change.This report submitted to the United Nations also recognizes that any 'definitive prediction of potential outcomes is not yet feasible' and that 'one of the weakest links in our knowledge is the connection between global and regional predictions of climate change.' ''Instead of the Kyoto treaty, Mr.  
<<Bush>>
  has called for  
//voluntary  measures that would allow gas emissions to continue  rise,//
But in this report, the administration said for the first time that the United States would be significantly affected by global warming in the next few decades.The report alarmed conservatives and representatives of various industries, especially utilities that rely on old technologies, and they accused Mr. Bush of flip-flopping on an important issue.Rush Limbaugh the conservative radio talk-show host, today called Mr. Bush ''George W. Al Gore,'' a reference to former Vice President  
<<Al Gore,>>
  who has long been concerned about  
//global   warming.//
But the moniker seemed to be an effort to deride Mr. Bush for adopting what many conservatives view as Mr. Gore's environmental extremism and to compliment the president for undercutting Mr. Gore on his signature issue.''All of this takes Al Gore's No. 1 issue away from him,'' Mr. Limbaugh told listeners.He predicted that the Senate majority leader, Senator Tom Daschle, Democrat of South Dakota, and the House minority leader, Representative Richard A. Gephardt, Democrat of Missouri, would be ''banging their heads against the wall'' because the report might pre-empt them from making a political issue of global warming.Christopher C. Horner a lawyer in Washington and senior fellow at  
<<the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a conservative research group,>>
  said today that Mr. Bush had distanced himself from the report ''because of concern from the right that he was going to accept  
//the  European environmental  view,//
''Mr. 
<<Horner>>
  said  
//Mr.  Bush could not possibly accept the premise of the report without also saying that the United States would do something  it.//
It was obvious to him that it's not tenable to sayyes, we're aggressively killing the planet and then not do something aggressive about it,'' he said. ''Our fear was that he would have to take severe action,'' after years of promising that he would not.But he said  
<<Mr. Bush>>
  was now in more of a bind because he could not  
//dismiss  the report as the product of bureaucrats without responding  it.//
The implication in Mr. Bush's dismissal, he said, was, ''There goes Governor Whitman again,'' a reference to Christie Whitman, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, who has sometimes been at odds with Mr. Bush over approaches to environmental problems.Joe Martyak, a spokesman for Mrs. Whitman, said that was an incorrect interpretation.The report said nothing new, Mr. Martyak said, and  
<<Mrs. Whitman>>
  ''agrees with  
//the  president that his plan is the best approach to dealing with  gasses.//
''Phil Clapp, president of the National Environmental Trust, said that Mr. Bush's response today reflected the difficult political position the report put him in. ''This is the same naked politics that this administration has exhibited on every major environmental issue,'' Mr. Clapp said.
Article no :18
Very weird.The Bush administration has acknowledged that the U.S. will experience far-reaching and, in some cases, devastating environmental consequences as a result of global warming.But it does not plan to do much about it.The administration has been so poor when it comes to climate change that this odd bit of news was initially seen as some sort of progress.It was thought, momentarily, that the president might be starting to pull his head out of the increasingly hot sand on this issue.The administration's interagency report, which was compiled by the Environmental Protection Agency, notes that the warming of the U.S. is expected to be greater in the 21st century than in the 20th, and will affect nearly every region of the country.Seas are expected to rise, causing an additional loss of coastal wetlands.Storm surges will pose a greater threat to coastal communities.We'll have to endure more stifling heat waves, and the disruption of snow-fed water supplies.Some treasured ecosystems, such as the Rocky Mountain meadows and certain coral reefs and barrier islands, are likely to disappear entirely.In addition to acknowledging that the earth is already sizzling, the report made it clear that human activity -- the burning of fossil fuels that release heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere -- was the primary culprit.This was no more than a statement of the obvious for most reputable scientists.But the acknowledgment was a first for the environmentally challenged Bush administration.And yet even this most minimal acceptance of reality was too much for the troglodyte wing of the president's party.Shrieks of outrage arose among conservatives, who immediately and loudly demanded that the president turn his back on the report and bury his head even more deeply in the sand.So on Tuesday there was  
<<George W. Bush>>
  dutifully distancing himself from  
//his  own  handiwork.//
He assured one and all that he had no plans to lead any assault on global warming.He was coldly dismissive of the interagency effort. ''I read the report put out by the bureaucracy,'' he said.That must have been pretty demoralizing for the people who worked hard to put the report together.If Mr. Bush did read it, he saw in Chapter 6 an interesting encapsulation of the projected global warming experience in the U.S. over the next few decades.Citing ''plausible'' model scenarios, the report said many areas of the country would undergo a change comparable to ''an overall northward shift'' in weather systems and climate conditions. ''The central tier of states would experience climate conditions roughly equivalent to those now experienced by the southern tier, and the northern tier would experience conditions much like the central tier.''This change is already under way.Some areas are experiencing ''a shorter duration of lake ice,''and there's already been ''a northward shift in the distributions of some species of butterflies.''These are changes that force you to wonder what kind of environment lies in wait just two or three generations hence.And yet we continue, with very little restraint, to spew out the so-called greenhouse gases.The United States is by far the biggest offender on the planet, producing about 25 percent of all the greenhouse gas emissions in the world.But the U.S. has refused to participate in the Kyoto Protocol, an international treaty that calls for the mandatory reduction of greenhouse gases by industrial nations.And the U.S. has refused to impose tough mandatory reductions on its own.Japan ratified the Kyoto Protocol on Tuesday.And the 15 members of the European Union jointly presented their ratification to the U.N. last week.But with the mightiest power on the planet unwilling to participate, and unwilling to formulate a real alternative, the gases will just keep building and building, causing the planet to get warmer and warmer.What we have here is a very serious problem that we understand and could do something about.But so far, because of a lack of presidential leadership, we've taken a pass.The E.P.A. report was called ''U.S. Climate Action Report -- 2002.''It should have been called the ''Inaction Report.''E-mail: bobherb@nytimes.com

In its business-as-usual approach to climate change, the Bush administration is increasingly out of step not only with  
<<other industrialized powers,>>
  but also with the growing support in this country for  
//action  to prevent  warming.//
The  
<<administration's>>
  oddly two-sided report last week to the United Nations brings the White House into the scientific mainstream on the subject -- acknowledging that human activity is probably the cause of global warming and that America itself faces serious consequences -- but at the same time lays out a strategy ensuring that  
//American  emissions of greenhouse gases will continue rising sharply for at least  decade.//
Last week  
<<the European Union>>
  and its 15 member states completed en masse their  
//ratification  of the emissions-limiting treaty that President Bush has rejected, the  Protocol.//
This week Japan followed suit.Russia expects to ratify by the end of the year, meaning only one or two smaller countries would be needed to put the treaty into effect.(Ratifying countries must account for at least 55 percent of developed country emissions in 1990.)The administration is also ignoring a growing domestic recognition of the need to act.Persuaded that the risks of climate change are real and that restraints on emissions are inevitable, many American companies are working on carbon reduction.To be sure, many others, especially in the energy and oil businesses, are strongly resistant.But dozens of major corporations like Alcoa, DuPont and Intel are among those setting their own targets for lower emissions.For many, there are financial payoffs, too -- improved efficiencies, lower costs and increased sales of energy-saving products.State governments are also moving ahead.New Hampshire recently became the third state to adopt mandatory controls on carbon emissions from power plants.New Jersey is aiming to reduce statewide emissions by 3.5 percent from 1990 levels in the years before 2005.All six New England states, in a compact with five Eastern Canadian provinces, have pledged to reduce their emissions to 10 percent below 1990 levels by 2020.Even in Congress, the tide is beginning to turn.Twice as many climate change measures were introduced in the past year as in the previous four years combined, many with strong support from both Democrats and Republicans.Scientists project that a century's worth of greenhouse gas releases, mostly from burning fossil fuels, have already bought us a few degrees of warming in the decades ahead.The challenge is heading off further warming by gradually weaning ourselves from fossil fuels.This transition to a low-carbon economy will require a new industrial revolution.We must look to the marketplace to carry it out.Only the market can mobilize the ingenuity, investment and productive capacity needed to develop and disperse new technologies on such a large scale.But the marketplace will deliver only if it perceives a demand, and providing that demand is a role for government.A modest but logical first step in the U.S. is a measure passed unanimously by the  
<<Senate>>
  in April  
//encouraging  companies to disclose their greenhouse gas  voluntarily.//
If after five years less than 60 percent of emissions are being reported to the public, the measure would change this voluntary reporting system to a mandatory one.A similar approach helped dramatically reduce toxic air and water pollution nationwide.This legislation should be accepted by the House and signed by the president.Ultimately, though, the market must be driven by policies that set realistic, binding targets for reducing emissions and give companies the flexibility to achieve them as affordably as possible.The Bush administration's own report shows the danger in its remaining stubbornly out of step.The longer the United States waits, the graver the risks -- and the cost of averting them.Eileen Claussen is president of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change.
Article no :21
President Bush continues to stumble on the issue of global warming.President Bush continues to stumble on the issue of global warming.Last year, to the dismay of America's allies, he rejected the 1997 Kyoto Protocol committing industrialized nations to reduce greenhouse gases.He also reneged on his campaign pledge to impose mandatory caps on carbon dioxide, the most important of those gases.Now he has dismissed a report written by his own experts.It asserts that human activities are largely responsible for global warming and warns that the environmental consequences could be severe.The report is the third in a series of studies required by  
//a  climate treaty signed by <CANDIDATE> Mr. Bush s father <ACTOR> in Rio de Janeiro  1992,//
It was presented to the United Nations last week and appeared unannounced on the Environmental Protection Agency's Web site.It does not openly challenge  
//the   approach//
 Mr.  
<<Bush>>
 But it is a serious study reflecting the views of scientists in six federal agencies, including the President's Council on Environmental Quality and its findings align  
<<the administration>>
  with  
//most  mainstream scientists as to the causes and consequences of  change.//
It deserves better than Mr.  
<<Bush>>
  s contemptuous response: ''I read the report put out by the bureaucracy,'' he said, before repeating his opposition to  
//Kyoto. The report obviously presented Mr. Bush with a ticklish problem.Having abandoned Kyoto and his campaign pledges, he had left himself without a meaningful strategy to deal with climate change.To acknowledge the truth of the study would have required him to offer such a strategy, or at least something more imaginative than the pallid voluntarism favored by many of his corporate friends and big campaign contributors.So he chose to brush it off.His timing was unfortunate.On Tuesday

Article no :23
The photo ops are guaranteed to promote Canada as a pristine oasis of Rocky Mountain tranquillity when President Bush and the other Group of 8 leaders discuss the world's problems Wednesday and Thursday in the resort village of Kananaskis.But the Canadian security forces are preparing extraordinary measures in this normally quiet Victorian capital and around western Alberta Province to control the kind of violent demonstrations that marred the last such meeting of industrial world leaders, in the Italian port city of Genoa, and the Summit of the Americas in Quebec City last year.A wide assortment of protest groups have been quiet about their exact plans.But they have organized a few thousand demonstrators from around Canada and the United States to march this week against globalization, free trade and perceived corporate greed, while supporting ratification of the Kyoto treaty as an antidote to global warming.Kananaskis, the leaders' picture-postcard meeting place 60 miles west of Calgary, consists of three small hotels, a post office and a general store set in the shadow of soaring Mount Kidd and amid two lush golf courses.They are not likely  
//to  see any  there,//
 which is perhaps the main reason Prime Minister  
<<Jean Chrétien>>
 His goal was to minimize the amount of time leaders spent in high-security motorcades and maximize the time talking face to face, without the distraction of protests and journalists.He has said he will try to focus the leaders on Africa, hoping they will agree that it needs more aid, trade and investment -- especially in those countries that strengthen democratic institutions and pursue free market policies.

France, Germany and  
<<the European Union>>
  all criticized some  
//aspects  of Mr.  approach//
But it was clear that Mr. Bush, who obviously hoped for an endorsement of his Mideast approach by the leaders here, will have to argue his case. ''I would not be surprised if the leaders discussed with the president their thoughts about the speech,'' Mr. Fleischer said.Among the skeptics it is clear he will have to convinceis Kofi Annan, the United Nations secretary general, who is due here late on Wednesday.Mr. Annan warned today that the American insistence on free elections among the Palestinian people could easily backfire. ''You could find yourself in a situation that the radicals are the ones that get elected, and it would be the result of a democratic process and we have to accept that,'' Mr. Annan said.President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who will join the political discussions herebut not the economic strategy sessions, said before he left Moscow that it would be ''dangerous and mistaken'' to remove Mr. Arafat because doing so ''would only radicalize the Palestinian movement.''What makes the dynamic at this meeting potentially the most interesting, though, is that Mr. Bush and the rest of the leaders will be arguing not only over Mideast policy, but also over a broad agenda of other differences that were submerged for months after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.At the summit meeting last year in Genoa, Mr. Bush and his allies promised to pick up the pieces on their differences over the Kyoto protocol on global warming, but in the year since there has been little progress.Trade tensions have worsened: European leaders made it clearthey believe Mr.  
<<Bush>>
  has turned his back on his commitment to free markets by  
//blocking  steel imports and raising subsidies  farmers.//
''I very much rely on the Canadians to be more outspoken here when it comes to criticizing''the United States, the German chancellor, Gerhard Schröder, told reporters as he visited Mr Chrétien. ''Because I -- speaking not only for Germany, but also for Europe -- have to say that we who sit in glass houses should ideally not be throwing stones.''
Article no :25
The United States cast its veto after its demand to put United States peacekeepers beyond the reach of the new International Criminal Court was rejected, then agreed to a three-day extension to give all sides time to seek a political solution.Britain has vigorously objected to American tariffs on steel imports and made it clear last week that it did not agree with Mr.  
<<Bush>>
  s call  
//to  replace Yasir Arafat as  leader.//
Britain is also a vocal supporter of the Kyoto treaty on eliminating greenhouse gases, which the United States has refused to ratify.But Mr. Blair said today that these disagreements would not shake Britain's links with the United States, which he called the ''foundation stone'' of Britain's foreign policy.
Article no :26
At the heart of the divergence was a fundamentally different vision of global organizations.The Europeans, accustomed by their history and geography to think in terms of multilateral arrangements, have always placed a greater premium on international organizations.To them, the end of the cold war brought  
//an  era for building international institutions and a global  system,//
 of which  
<<the European Union>>
 In the United States, international organizations like the United Nations have always been viewed with suspicion, much of it affirmed by the anti-American and anti-Israeli votes of the cold war.The emergence of the United States as the sole military, economic and cultural superpower has only deepened the resistance, especially among American conservatives, to any potential international restraints on American powers.''An800-pound gorilla just doesn't like anything to restrict its freedom of action, unless it thinks it can control it completely,'' said Stephen M. Walt, professor of international affairs at the Kennedy School at Harvard.Beyond that, Professor Walt said, there was a sincere fear among many American officials that Americans engaged in military or other operations overseascould become subject to politicized prosecution. ''The fairly extensive role the U.S. military has taken around the world makes it leery of being tried by a tribunal whose standards we can't control,'' he said.For the Europeans, however, the American stand amounts to a double standard: one set of rules for the United States, another for the rest of the world.Several stands taken by the  
<<United States>>
  since the end of the cold war -- against  
//the  Kyoto Protocols on greenhouse gases, against biological weapons testing, against a ban on  mines//
''Thereyou see the beginning of a real problem,'' said a senior European diplomat at the United Nations. ''If the U.S. says we are from a different nature, we cannot be compared with others, discipline is good for others, but not for the United States, then the future of humanity is at stake.If the United States believes it doesn't need to respect multilateralism and international rules, how do you get China to respect them?''The tensions were already there long before Sept. 11.But in the immediate aftermath of the terror attacks, most of the world lined up in solidarity behind the United States, and  
<<the Security Council>>
  passed resolutions requiring  
//all  United Nations members to act  terrorism.//

Do you remember the character Pig-Pen in the ''Peanuts'' cartoons?He was always covered with dirt and grime.He was cute, but he was a walking sludge heap, filthy and proud of it.He once told Charlie Brown, ''I have affixed to me the dirt and dust of countless ages.Who am I to disturb history?''For me, Pig-Pen's attitude embodies President Bush's approach to the environment.We've been trashing, soiling, even destroying the wonders of nature for countless ages.Why stop now?Who is Mr. Bush to step in and curb this venerable orgy of pollution, this grand tradition of fouling our own nest?Oh, the skies may once have been clear and the waters sparkling and clean.But you can't have that and progress, too.Can you?This week we learned that the  
<<Bush>>
  administration plans  
//to  cut funding for the cleanup of 33 toxic waste sites in  states.//
As The Times's Katharine Seelye reported, this means ''that work is likely to grind to a halt on some of the most seriously polluted sites in the country.''The cuts were ordered because the Superfund toxic waste cleanup program is running out of money.Rather than showing the leadership necessary to replenish the fund, the president plans to reduce its payouts by cleaning up fewer sites.Pig-Pen would have been proud.This is not a minor matter.The sites targeted by the Superfund program are horribly polluted, in many cases with cancer-causing substances.Millions of Americans live within a few miles of these sites.The Superfund decision is the kind of environmental move we've come to expect from the Bush administration.Mother Nature has been known to tremble at the sound of the president's approaching footsteps.He's an environmental disaster zone.In February a top enforcement official at the Environmental Protection Agency Eric Schaeffer, quit because of  
<<Bush administration>>
  policies that he said  
//undermined  the agency's efforts to crack down on  polluters.//
Mr. Schaeffer said he felt he was ''fighting a  
<<White House>>
  that seems determined to  
//weaken  the rules we are trying  enforce.//
''That, of course, is exactly what this White House is doing.Within weeks of Mr. Schaeffer s resignation came official word that the  
<<administration>>
  was  
//relaxing  the air quality regulations that applied to older coal-fired  plants,//
During this same period, the president broke his campaign promise to regulate the industrial emissions of carbon dioxide, a move that, among other things, would have helped in the fight to slow the increase in global warming.Mr.  
<<Bush>>
  has also turned his back on  
//the  Kyoto Protocol, which would require industrial nations to reduce their emissions of carbon dioxide and other  gases.//
The president was even disdainful of his own administration's report on global warming, which acknowledged that the U.S. would experience far-reaching and, in some cases, devastating environmental consequences as a result of the climate change.The president's views on global warming seem aligned with those of the muddle-headed conservative groups in Texas that have been forcing rewrites in textbooks to fit their political and spiritual agendas.In one environmental science textbook, the following was added:''In the past, the earth has been much warmer than it is now, and fossils of sea creatures show us that the sea level was much higher than it is today.So does it really matter if the world gets warmer?''Senator  
<<Joseph Lieberman>>
  not exactly a left-winger on the environment or anything else, gave a speech in California in February in which he assailed  
//the  president's lack of leadership on global warming and other  issues.//
 
<<He>>
  characterized the president's energy policy as ''mired in crude oil'' and said Mr. Bush had been ''AWOL in  
//the  war against  pollution.//
 
<<''Several states,>>
  fed up with Mr. Bush's capitulation to industry on these matters, have moved on their own  
//to  protect the environment and develop more progressive  policies.//
Simply stated, the president has behaved irresponsibly toward the environment and shows no sign of changing his ways.You could laugh at Pig-Pen.He was just a comic strip character.But Mr. Bush is no joke.His trashing of the environment is a deadly serious matter.E-mail: bobherb@nytimes.com
Article no :28
Despite heavy industry lobbying,  
<<California's Legislature>>
  approved a bill last week that for the first time would  
//force  automakers to limit emissions of  dioxide,//
The bill is unquestionably the most important step taken in this country to control greenhouse emissions since 1998, when the  
<<Clinton>>
  administration signed  
//the   Protocol,//
The bill contains no specific mandates beyond the model year (2009) when cleaner cars have to be on the road.Details will be worked out in negotiations between the companies and state regulatory authorities.Nevertheless, assuming Gov.  
<<Gray Davis>>
  signs the bill, as he apparently plans to do, it will inevitably drive Detroit and other  
//automakers  to manufacture more  vehicles.//
More broadly, the bill is a potentially monumental step in the war on warming -- cars and light trucks account for one-third of greenhouse gas emissions nationwide and 40 percent in California.It is also another reminder, if any were needed, of how sluggish the national government has been in addressing the threat of global climate change. 
<<Congress>>
  has refused to  
//require  any meaningful increase in fuel efficiency since  1980's.//
On climate policy generally, Mr.  
<<Bush>>
  remains fixated on  
//a  voluntary approach that promises little hope of significant reductions in power plant and other industrial emissions of  dioxide.//
On the bright side,  
<<the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee>>
  last week approved a bill that would impose  
//mandatory  caps on carbon dioxide emissions and three  pollutants//
Mandatory caps of some sort are necessary to contain the gradual -- and, if we wait too long, irreversible -- buildup of greenhouse gases in the earth's atmosphere.But the bill's margin of approval was razor-thin, and without a courageous conversion or two among prominent Republicans, it stands little chance in the Senate and even less in the House.One would have expected a greater sense of urgency.Less than a month ago we were treated to an authoritative interagency report, which Mr. Bush belittled, that reinforced earlier warnings from mainstream scientists that unchecked warming will bring devastating consequences, including rising seas, coastal flooding, disruption of snow-fed water supplies, heat waves and the disappearance of sensitive ecosystems like coral reefs.Then came a more narrowly focused but equally disturbing report by The Times's Timothy Egan about Alaska, where an astonishing seven-degree increase in average temperatures over 30 years has led to melting permafrost, sagging roads, dying forests, unexpected forest fires and disruption of marine life.Even Ted Stevens, the influential Republican senator from Alaska who usually has little patience with environmentalists, is openly alarmed about global warming's potential cost to his home state, an amount that could run into the billions of dollars, and is privately even more alarmed by Washington's indifference.It is in this depressing context that California's action is so welcome.The bill is designed to give the automakers great flexibility, and expressly rules out mandatory weight reductions and fuel taxes.Inevitably, though, the automakers will have to achieve fleetwide improvements in fuel economy, which means making more cars that emit less pollution by adding fuel-saving technologies like hybrid engines.California has long been more adventurous than even the federal government in pushing for cleaner cars, and over time this has benefited the nation as a whole because automakers have eventually decided to sell the cars they make for California in other markets.Once again, the country owes California a vote of thanks.Correction:  July 11, 2002, Thursday  A front-page article on June 16 about climate change in Alaska misstated the rise in temperatures there in the last 30 years.(The error was repeated in an editorial on Monday and in the Bob Herbert column on the Op-Ed page of June 24.)According to an assessment by the University of Alaska's Center for Global Change and Arctic System Research, the annual mean temperature has risen 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit over 30 years, not 7 degrees.

  who backs the plan, counters by saying that Iceland has profitably taken big risks to attract smelters twice before, that  
//it  must keep its rural areas populated and that it will still be able to establish a stunning  park,//
''We'vecalculated that the damage is relatively small,'' he said in an interview. ''And even 600 jobs in this part of Iceland is very important. 
//''The   plan//
 was approved by 44 of  
<<Parliament>>
 In a poll,  
<<47 percent of Icelanders>>
  who responded supported  
//the   plan,//
The chilly tundra north of Vatnajokull Glacier is Europe's second-largest wilderness area, after Svarlbard Island in the Arctic.The latest plan calls for damming up two of the area's three virgin rivers, draining them through 24 miles of tunnels, and then pouring the water through turbines to generate 700 megawatts of electricity.Last August, environmentalists declared victory when  
<<Iceland's State Planning Agency>>
  killed  
//the  plan, saying that the dams would do too much  damage//
But the agency decision was reversed in December by the environment minister, a member of  
<<the Progressive Party>>
  which strongly advocates  
//repopulating   Iceland.//
 
<<Environmentalists>>
  cheered again this April when  
//Norsk  Hydro the Norwegian aluminum company,  out//
Its chief executive also said he had doubts about finding enough workers in the east, which has only about 11,000 residents.But the government vigorously pursued a new customer, and Alcoa's chairman, Alain Belda, told local papers recently that there was ''a good chance'' it would step in and build a smelter in Reydarfjorur, for the export market.The actual price at which Iceland will sell Alcoa its hydropower is still being negotiated, and will not be made public.But Norsk Hydro was known to be negotiating for around 2 cents per kilowatt-hour, half the rates in the United States and less than a third of some in Europe.An outspoken opponent of the project, Kolbrun Haldorsdottir of the Left-Green Party, said the government was ''not even begging on its knees to the aluminum companies any more: they're amputated; we're on stumps.''The country, she said, only bothers to do environmental impact studies because of European Union pressure, and its secretiveness over the price ''makes us a banana republic.''Mr.Oddsson, who has been prime minister for 11 years, bristled at this and said: ''My opposition has gone bananas.This process is very transparent.''Members of all parties sit on the board of the national power company, Landsvirkjun, he said.A Russian company has also expressed interest, but both the government and environmentalists note that Alcoa says it can coexist with a national park and has a relatively good environmental record.The chief of the American branch of the World Wildlife Fund sits on its board, though she says she has recused herself from anything to do with this project.There is another plum for Alcoa in the deal.Because Iceland is so pollution-free -- 98 percent of its buildings have geothermal heat and hot water -- Iceland negotiated an exception to the Kyoto accord on greenhouse gases, so Alcoa will not have to pay penalties for the carbon dioxide emissions that its smelter will produce.The company has agreed to do the dirtier parts of its operation overseas.It may switch to new low-carbon dioxide technology and will supply the plant by ship rather than truck.Environmentalists remain hostile, but less to the smelter than to the dams.The current plan calls for eight of them across tributaries of the two rivers, Jokulsa a Dal and Jokulsa i Fljotsdal.The small, high-altitude reservoirs on the Fljotsdal would drain through tunnels into a huge new reservoir on the Dal.It, in turn, would drain through a 24-mile-long tunnel over the edge of a plateau, through the turbines, and then back into the bed of the Fljotsdal where it widens into a lake.There would be, environmentalists complain, a multitude of effects.Helgi Hallgrimsson, 67, who has opposed the project for decades and calls it a potential ''world-famous example of short-sighted politics and subservience to foreign capital,'' contends that 100 waterfalls between 6 feet and 130 feet high will be lost.

WHILE politicians and even chief executives make righteous speeches and advocate tougher penalties for corporate misdeeds, Sister Patricia Daly is smiling.For three decades, she has been quietly forcing changes her own way.Or perhaps not so quietly. 
<<Sister Daly>>
  45, a Dominican nun and member of the Interfaith Center for Corporate Responsibility, leads its efforts  
//to  make corporations more liable financially for damage to the environment and climate changes from  warming.//
Operating frequently from the group's headquarters on the Upper West Side in Manhattan, in a square building known as ''the God Box,'' Sister Daly spends her days meeting with corporate executives, drafting shareholder resolutions and trying to put pressure on large corporations like Exxon Mobil and General Electric.To Sister Daly, her activism is more than socially responsible investing or missionary work. ''Being a faithful member of a religious tradition doesn't always mean just showing up for services on a Saturday or Sunday,'' she said. ''It means being engaged.''Shareholderanger over scandals at Enron, Global Crossing, WorldCom, Adelphia Communications andthe like have, in an odd way, been like manna from heaven for what she considers the broader cause of making corporations better citizens through shareholder activism.Not only were a record 721 shareholder resolutions filed this year, of which the Interfaith Center sponsored 144, but shareholders voted for them in record numbers. 
<<Sister Daly>>
  said she was particularly excited about gains made by resolutions that  
//ask  companies to report on their greenhouse gas emissions and what they are doing to  them.//
An unprecedented 20 resolutions addressed climate change this year.More than  
<<28 percent of shareholders at Eastman Chemical>>
  and 27 percent at American Standard supported  
//them. At  
<<Exxon Mobil 20 percent of shareholders>>
  voted in favor of two resolutions, one asking the company to  
//reduce   emissions//
 and other to  
//disclose  the cost of delays in toxic  cleanups.//
; Sister Daly considered that a major victory. ''It's a real warning to them,'' she said.Although the resolutions did not pass, they will automatically remain on the annual-meeting agenda.Sister Daly's influence comes from the Interfaith Center's $110 billion in combined assets, mainly the pension funds of ministers, priests and nuns among its 275 religious organization members.The assets include substantial holdings in many large corporations.In the boom years, ''the treasury of my parish was certainly happy to see 25 percent returns,'' she said.But her attitude is that, as shareholders, ''we're part of the problem here.''SisterDaly views her work as following in the tradition of the Dominican order, founded in the 13th century by St. Dominic to fight heresies and untruths. ''We're dealing with some of the  
//heresies  and untruths  capitalism,''//
  
<<Sister Daly>>
 But some critics say she has been too quick to accept environmentalist positions. ''I respect what the sister is doing because that is what she believes,'' said  
<<Frank Maisano>>
  an energy consultant and former spokesman for the Global Climate Coalition, an energy industry group that disbanded after having successfully lobbied against  
//Senate  ratification of the Kyoto Protocol on  emissions.//
'But I think she is somewhat misled at times by colleagues in the environmental community because they are somewhat less than honest about what industry is doing.''Others give grudging praise. ''Although we disagree with Sister Pat on her issues, she appears to be a dedicated activistand I'm sure we will have further discussions on Exxon Mobil's position,'' said Patrick Mulva, Exxon Mobil's vice president for investor relations.Sister Daly is known for tangling with chief executives at shareholder meetings.In an exchange with John F. Welch Jr. of General Electric in 1998, she challenged his resistance to taking responsibility for P.C.B. pollution from G.E. factories in New York's Hudson Valley.Sister Daly compared Mr. Welch's stance on P.C.B.'s -- chemicals also known as polychlorinated biphenyls -- to that of tobacco executives who once swore that cigarette smoke was harmless.Mr. Welch called Sister Daly's contention ''outrageous'' while she continued peppering him with well-informed questions until he abruptly moved on to the next agenda item -- a rare retreat for America's best-known corporate chief.Mr. Welch's office said he was on vacation and not available to comment.''C.E.O.'s sometimes have a difficult time dealing with Pat,'' said Seamus Finn, a colleague at the Interfaith Center.No chief executive is spared, even President Bush.Sister Daly described his recent speech criticizing Wall Street miscreants as ''without substance.''TimothySmith, senior vice president and director for social responsibility at Walden Asset Management, a money management firm, said Sister Daly had an unusual ability to win allies from unlikely corners.''It takes a certain amount of skill to speak the language of different constituencies from Greenpeace to the State of New York to corporate boardrooms,'' Mr. Smith said.For example,  
<<Sister Daly>>
  met Bianca Jagger on the eve of a BP shareholder meeting in London and piqued her interest in  
//organizing  a boycott of Esso, a European subsidiary of Exxon Mobil, because of the company's position on  warming.//
 
<<Ms. Jagger>>
  then worked with  
//Greenpeace  on the Stop  campaign//
Sister Daly grew up in Brooklyn and Queens and moved to Connecticut in her teens.She became a corporate activist in the 70's as a new member of the Sisters of Saint Dominic of Caldwell, N.J., campaigning against corporate labor practices and apartheid.

While automakers rail against landmark California legislation that would force them to cut greenhouse gas emissions by the end of the decade, they face a much more immediate challenge from the state.On Monday, Gov.  
<<Gray Davis>>
  of California will sign a bill  
//requiring  automakers to cut carbon dioxide emissions by the 2008  year.//
The bill directs the California Air Resources Board to decide how much to reduce emissions over all and how to do it.But of more immediate concern for automakers is one of California's last big initiatives on air pollution -- a decade-old mandate to create zero-emission vehicles that could soon force them to sell more than 100,000 electric cars and other fuel-efficient vehicles in the state each year.Although the zero-emission standard, which was scheduled to take effect with the 2003 model year, has been delayed by a court injunction, it has prompted automakers to spend billions of dollars developing technologies to cut harmful tailpipe emissions and has led them to start promoting and selling electric vehicles.In addition,

Other states could follow suit.The mandate, set in motion in 1990, aims to cut emissions of nitrogen oxide and hydrocarbons, large contributors to smog, and particulates, which lead to respiratory ailments.But  
//the   mandate//
 has been delayed by a legal challenge from  
<<General Motors>>
 State regulators have appealed and insist they will be able to tweak the regulation, if necessary, to mollify legal objections.The rule requires large automakers to derive 10 percent of sales from vehicles that produce nearly zero emissions, including at least 2 percent from vehicles with no emissions.Auto executives say that 2 percent requirement has forced them to keep alive a technology they would just as soon give up on: the battery-powered automobile, the only pure zero-emission vehicle now made.To comply, carmakers are already selling everything from armies of beefed-up golf carts to a few electric versions of sport utility vehicles to highly efficient versions of gas vehicles.Nissan is equipping most Sentra sedans sold in California with an extra catalytic converter.Toyota is advertising an electric version of its RAV4 sport utility vehicle on a billboard in Berkeley, at nearly double the normal price.Some executives worry that they will have to take additional steps to meet the mandate, like subsidizing sales of costly electric vehicles and spending thousands of dollars a vehicle to convert gas cars to electrics.''I remember I had a meeting in Tokyo where they showed me all the cost of this stuff.I said, 'Oh my God, the others have to do this too?' ''Carlos Ghosn, the chief executive of Nissan, said.''Nobody believes in it, but you have to do it,'' Mr. Ghosn said. ''It's a huge cost, but it's part of the cost of doing business.''Californiaregulators, as well as environmental groups, counter that the rule has forced automakers to accelerate the development of cleaner technologies with sound prospects.These include hybrid engines, which run on both gasoline and electricity, as well as hydrogen fuel cells, a zero-emission technology widely considered as the power source of the future.''Theywouldn't have been topics of discussion if not for Z.E.V.,'' said Jerry Martin, a spokesman for the California Air Resources Board, the regulatory body that established the mandate. ''The standard fare for drivers around the world would be 8,500-poundS.U.V.'s, probably half of them powered by diesel.''The air resources board has also modified the regulation several times to give automakers credit for cars with low emissions.Many zero-emission vehicles in California are more golf cart than car and meant for gated communities, city-sponsored car sharing programs and corporate and government fleets.The Think division of Ford sells a beefed-up golf cart called the Neighbor for $6,500, which needs six to eight hours to recharge after traveling 30 miles.Ford is also considering bringing an electric subcompact sold in Europe, the Think City, to California.For a Think Neighbor ''we had a man trade in his Cadillac,'' said H. L. Fletcher, fleet manager of Fritts Ford in Riverside, Calif., who sells 40 to 50 Neighbors a month.Mr. Fletcher said the man, in his mid-80s, was ''too old to drive a big car and bought a Think to drive back and forth from the grocery store and get himself around.''Butmany car executives say the development of realistic technologies is being sacrificed for the money-losing, obsolete idea of electric cars.California has shown some flexibility, though.Nissan, for instance, has a varied compliance plan.It makes an electric station wagon, the Altra, that can travel 100 miles between charges and is being leased to power companies like Southern California Edison.It also makes a big golf cart, the Hypermini, that is being used in Pasadena and Palm Springs for parking enforcement.And Nissan will get credits for its modified Sentra.The most familiar vehicle is the electric version of Toyota's RAV4, which can go up to 78 miles an hour and travel up to 126 miles before it requires a recharge.The RAV4 EV sells for $42,510, versus a $17,000 starting price for a gasoline version, although it is eligible for $13,000 in state and federal rebates.Toyota has sold 120 since February. ''We lose large amounts of money on every EV we sell,'' said Mike Love, Toyota's national regulatory affairs manager. ''They cost us in excess of $100,000 apiece to build.''New York and Massachusetts have plans to adopt mandates that would give automakers until the 2006 model year before they have to produce any pure zero-emission vehicles.Until then, car companies could comply by selling hybrids, efficient gas cars or cars that use alternative fuels.''Thesmall neighborhood-type vehicles really aren't as marketable here in the Northeast,'' said Gina McCarthy, assistant secretary for the environment in the Massachusetts executive office of environmental affairs. ''Residents in Massachusetts are really looking to get access to hybrids.They're buying them now, and they're on waiting lists.We want more hybrids.''Erin

  the commissioner of the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, said earlier this year that  
//the  state's Z.E.V. mandate will be a strong incentive  automakers.//
For the moment, though, both states are awaiting the outcome of the legal challenge in California.In 1990, when California's zero-emission mandate was formulated, there were hopes that the electric vehicle would be viable for the mass market by the end of the decade.But technology has still not solved the crucial drawbacks: short range and long charging time. 
<<G.M.,>>
  now the most outspoken opponent of  
//the   mandate,//
G.M. plans to use credits from sales of the EV-1 to help meet the requirement, though it is not clear how it will comply if its legal challenge fails.Part of its plan, which has angered competitors, is to give away electric vehicles it has purchased from Club Car, a golf cart maker.''You don't  
//mandate   markets,''//
 said Chris Preuss a

//The  Z.E.V. mandate, <CANDIDATE> he <ACTOR> added, was ''completely unworkable both in California and  else.//
''The suit in federal court filed by  
<<G.M. and DaimlerChrysler>>
  along with some state dealers, contends  
//the  mandate is superseded by federal fuel  standards.//
Though reducing gas mileage is one way to cut harmful emissions, direct action on that is reserved for the federal government.A federal judge in Fresno granted the plaintiffs an injunction last month, saying the automakers had a strong case because of a 2001 amendment that gave credits for high-mileage vehicles.The air quality board, which at first threatened to enforce an older version of the regulation, has since appealed and says it will rewrite the mandate if necessary.Environmental groups say they have little choice but to turn California into a battleground. 
<<The auto industry>>
  has successfully lobbied since the 1980's to prevent  
//significant  increases in federal gas  standards,//
Since California's air quality regulations predate the federal Clean Air Act, it has its own, tougher rules, and other states can choose whether to follow them.The Z.E.V. rule was set in motion before global warming was a hot-button issue and was aimed at pollutants that lead to smog and other environmental hazards.Whether carbon dioxide, linked to global climate change, is itself a pollutant is a matter of much debate, but the Z.E.V. mandate will have the practical effect of curbing such emissions as well.''It forced the auto industry to evaluate and use technologies they never wanted to even look at,'' said Daniel Becker, director of global warming strategies at the Sierra Club, adding, ''As a direct result of that, we have hybrid electric vehicles on sale today.''

IF Detroit and California ever made a sitcom together, it would be sort of like ''Dharma and Greg.''Detroit, the strait-laced company town, just can't figure out that wacky California.Is it the nation's biggest car market, or is it the most troublesome?Is it the land of Ronald Reagan and Lee Iacocca, or of tree hugging hippies who want every car to be electric?Yes, Arnold Schwarzenegger lives there, and he drove a Hummer before anybody else.
