We	O

two	O
things	O

One	O
is	O
that	O
Europe	O
has	O
recently	O
had	O
some	O
very	O
bad	O
experiences	O
with	O
contaminated	O
food	O

the	O

that	O

perfectly	O

--	O
until	O

That	O
experience	O
was	O
all	O
the	O
more	O
searing	O
because	O

is	O
to	O
European	O
culture	O
what	O
free	O

to	O
American	O
culture	O
.	O
	
There	O
may	O
be	O
no	O
good	O

reason	O
for	O
concern	O

but	O
to	O
consider	O
eating	O
something	O
that	O
has	O
resulted	O
from	O
some	O
laboratory	O
manipulation	O
is	O
felt	O
by	O
many	O
Europeans	O
as	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
denial	O

that	O

another	O
exercise	O
in	O
American	O

We	O
may	O
win	O
the	O
case	O
before	O
the	O

that	O
is	O

to	O
guarantee	O
a	O

The	O

will	O
argue	O
that	O
it	O
wants	O
only	O
to	O

a	O
choice	O

But	O
as	O
one	O
who	O
spent	O
years	O
selling	O
to	O

consumers	O
,	O
I	O
can	O
say	O
with	O
confidence	O
that	O
such	O
a	O
move	O
by	O
the	O

would	O
very	O
likely	O
result	O
in	O
a	O

That	O

us	O
to	O
the	O

point	O

We	O
have	O
already	O
caused	O
great	O
